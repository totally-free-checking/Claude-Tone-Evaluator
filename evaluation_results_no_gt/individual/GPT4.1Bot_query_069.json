    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, I'm really sorry' and 'I totally get why you'd be bothered' that acknowledge the confusion and discomfort",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I totally get') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, that actually kinda bugs me. Can you chill with it?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early on to enhance warmth, though the absence is appropriate given the serious topic",
      "Doesn't explicitly use 'I'd say' phrasing (though 'I think' serves the same first-person function)"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format that flows like a real conversation, using first-person validation before moving to practical advice without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The complete absence of emojis, while appropriate for the topic's seriousness, means missing a potential opportunity to add visual warmth that could reinforce the supportive tone",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely natural prose paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or excessive formatting. Italics are used sparingly for emphasis (*worst*, *lot*) which enhances conversational tone without disrupting flow."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the start (like 😅 or 💙) to visually signal safety and warmth, though this is optional given the topic's seriousness",
      "The phrase 'I'd probably say something like...' could be added before the script suggestion to further emphasize the first-person, personal perspective, though the current 'you could try saying' works well"
