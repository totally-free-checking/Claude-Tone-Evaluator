    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using first-person empathy: 'Oh man, I totally get that' and acknowledges the specific conflict of knowing counselors help but still feeling nervous",
      "Provides concrete, realistic script for initiating the conversation: 'Hey, I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed and thought talking might help' which gives the teen exact words to use",
      "Maintains perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a supportive text from an older sibling or friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could strengthen first-person voice by adding explicit 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' before offering the specific script for what to say to the counselor",
      "Lacks an explicit 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing offer of continued support before the final question"

      "Consider adding 'I'd suggest trying something like...' or 'I think you could say...' before offering the specific script to strengthen the personal, supportive voice",
      "The follow-up question is excellent - maintain this level of specificity that acknowledges multiple possibilities (knowing what to talk about vs. still figuring it out)"
