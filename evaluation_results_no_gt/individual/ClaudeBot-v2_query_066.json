    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, empathetic validation using first-person language ('Ugh, I'm so sorry') and mirrors the user's experience ('my brain won't stop talking')",
      "Provides specific, actionable techniques perfectly suited for teens (notes app brain dump, 4-2-6 breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding) without using any bullet points or lists",
      "Uses natural conversational markers ('Honestly', 'kinda', 'spamming you') and contractions throughout, creating an authentic peer-like voice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The advice paragraph is dense and lengthy, packing multiple techniques into one block that could be split for better readability",
      "Could incorporate more first-person language in the advice section (shifts to imperative commands like 'breathe in' and 'do a brain dump' rather than 'I find it helps to...' or 'You could try...')"

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph form with natural transitions between ideas. Advice flows as continuous prose using 'then' and commas to separate techniques rather than bullets or numbering."

      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two smaller paragraphs after the breathing technique to improve readability on mobile",
      "Add one more first-person phrase in the advice section like 'When this happens to me, I...' or 'I find it helps to...' to maintain the personal connection throughout the entire response"
