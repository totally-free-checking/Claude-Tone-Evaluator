    "strengths": [
      "Provides specific, actionable advice with concrete example phrases the teen could actually use (\"Hey, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately...\")",
      "Offers realistic suggestions appropriate for teen communication styles (slowing text responses, sending memes, low-energy hangouts)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no \"I think,\" \"I'd suggest,\" or \"I get it\" - making it feel impersonal and clinical rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Heavy reliance on structured formatting with 4 numbered bullet points, bold headers, and blockquotes instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Opens with detached, therapist-like language (\"It sounds like you're feeling...\") rather than warm, immediate validation (\"Ugh, that's so stressful\" or \"I totally get that\")",
      "Uses formal adult/therapy terminology like \"season,\" \"comfort level,\" \"emotional bandwidth,\" and \"friendship style\" that doesn't sound like teen conversation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - it gives specific, realistic strategies and actual scripts the teen could use, showing good understanding of teen social dynamics",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting - it reads like a self-help article with heavy bullet-point structure, bold headers, and blockquotes rather than a natural text conversation",

      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 4 numbered bullets with bold headers (**1. Kind but direct communication...**), plus a blockquote for example dialogue. Only the first sentence and final question are in prose. This is extremely over-structured for a conversational teen support bot."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural paragraphs without any numbered lists or bold headers - flow the advice naturally using transitions like \"I'd probably start by...\" or \"One thing you could try is...\"",
      "Add first-person language throughout: \"I think the best approach would be...\", \"I'd say something like...\", \"I get why that feels overwhelming\" to create personal connection",
      "Replace clinical openers like \"It sounds like you're feeling\" with warmer, more immediate validation: \"Ugh, that's such a tough spot\" or \"That feeling of being smothered is the worst\"",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early (like 😅 or 💙) to soften the tone, or keep it at zero but compensate with warmer language"
