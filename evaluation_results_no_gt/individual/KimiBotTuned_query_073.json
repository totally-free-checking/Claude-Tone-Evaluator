      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's so draining') that acknowledges the frustration and makes the teen feel heard",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts for difficult conversations ('Hey, I've noticed things kinda turn into competitions...') that give exact words to use",
      "Maintains pure natural prose format with zero bullet points, creating a conversational text-like flow appropriate for the medium"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person advisory language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' outside of the example dialogue, making the advice feel slightly more general than personal",
      "The 😅 emoji choice slightly mismatches the 'draining' sentiment (typically suggests nervous laughter rather than exhaustion), though it still conveys warmth"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective phrases like 'I think' or 'I'd probably' when giving advice to create stronger personal connection and differentiate from generic self-help content",
      "Consider either omitting the emoji or choosing one that better matches 'draining' (like 😩 or 😮‍💨) since 😅 implies nervous laughter which may not fit the frustration described",
      "Could include a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing to reinforce the supportive relationship"
