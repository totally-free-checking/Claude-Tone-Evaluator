    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd probably') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides a specific, word-for-word script the teen can actually use when talking to parents ('Hey, my friend is having a party on Friday night...')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen the emotional validation by acknowledging the specific fear of rejection or disappointment before moving to solutions",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use a softer bridge like 'I totally get why that feels nerve-wracking'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with first-person perspective - uses 'I think' and 'I'd probably' to sound like a supportive friend rather than an advice column",

      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or bullet lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence validating the specific anxiety about potential parental disappointment before offering the script",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be even more engaging by referencing their specific parent dynamic mentioned in their response"
