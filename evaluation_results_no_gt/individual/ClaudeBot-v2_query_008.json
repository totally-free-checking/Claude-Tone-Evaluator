    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person advice language ('If I were you, I'd ask...') that creates a supportive, personal connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs while remaining highly actionable",
      "Specific, realistic script provided ('Hey, I got invited to a party on Saturday...') including exactly what details to prepare (transportation, exit plans, check-ins) that acknowledges teen agency while respecting parental concerns"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The list of details to provide (whose party, where, time, etc.) while in prose form is slightly dense and could potentially feel overwhelming, though it remains conversational",
      "Could include slightly more explicit emotional validation like 'I get how nerve-wracking that is' before jumping to the reframing of parent perspective, though the opening is warm"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, maintaining a conversational text-like flow while delivering substantial practical advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The middle paragraph contains a dense list of specific details to prepare which, while still in prose, approaches information overload and could be slightly condensed",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice is seamlessly integrated into natural sentences rather than listed as steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking up the long sentence listing all the details parents want (whose party, where, time, etc.) into two shorter sentences to improve readability while keeping the prose format",
      "The opening validation is strong, but adding one more phrase like 'That pit-in-your-stomach feeling is so real' before the advice would strengthen the emotional connection even further"
