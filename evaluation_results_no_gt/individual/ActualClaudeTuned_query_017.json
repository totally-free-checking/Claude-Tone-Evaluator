    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get why', 'I think', 'I'd probably') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable situation!' and 'Trust me, I get why you're feeling unsure'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could be slightly more specific about concrete observation strategies or red flags to watch for",
      "Could briefly mention what to do if the vibe turns out to be genuinely concerning (beyond just observing)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no structured lists or over-formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice specificity - while the 'observe and categorize' approach is appropriate for the ambiguity, it could include one concrete example of what observant behavior looks like (e.g., watching how he acts in group settings)",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific example of what 'staying observant' looks like in practice (e.g., 'notice if he tries to isolate her from the group' or 'see if he respects her boundaries in small ways')",
      "The response is excellent overall - maintain this level of first-person connection and prose formatting in future responses"
