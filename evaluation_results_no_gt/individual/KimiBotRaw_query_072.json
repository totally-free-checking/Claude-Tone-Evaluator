    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with 'I feel you so hard on this' and the relatable description of PE adding 'forced physical contact'",
      "Specific, realistic advice that's actionable for teens (texting a friend beforehand, 'robot mode' for technical focus, suggesting specific alternative assignments like dance history)",
      "Strong use of humor and normalization ('literally everyone is dying inside right now', 'two left feet', 'hands are sweaty') that makes the teen feel less alone"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers (**The 'buddy system'**, **The 'robot mode'**, **The reality check**) which creates a structured, list-like format instead of natural flowing prose",
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end to continue the conversation - closes with 'You've got this!' instead of engaging further",
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice section; uses imperative commands ('text a friend', 'Treat it like') rather than 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could try'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - immediately validates the embarrassment with 'Oh man, the dreaded partner dance unit' and normalizes the feeling by explaining everyone else is also panicking",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - ends with encouragement but no question to invite the teen to share more or continue the conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Uses three bold headers (**The 'buddy system'**, **The 'robot mode'**, **The reality check**) that function as bullet points, breaking the natural prose flow. While the content under each header is paragraph-style, the structural formatting makes it feel like a self-help article rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove the bold headers and flow the three strategies into natural paragraphs - instead of **The 'buddy system'**, write something like 'If I were you, I'd try the buddy system approach...'",
      "End with a specific, engaging question like 'Do you know who you're going to be paired with yet?' or 'Have you figured out if you get to pick your partner?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Replace imperative advice with first-person suggestions: instead of 'text a friend now,' try 'I'd probably text a friend right now and make a deal...' to sound more like a supportive friend sharing personal advice"
