    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sounds so overwhelming already' and 'I totally get why that feels way too soon'",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact script: 'I appreciate you thinking about this, but can we keep it light for now? I'm still exploring what I like'",

      "Could slightly expand on the emotional validation before transitioning to normalization, though the balance is still quite good",

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as conversational paragraphs with no headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."

      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure validation before explaining why parents do this, to ensure the teen feels fully heard before problem-solving",
      "The response is exemplary overall - maintain this exact balance of casual first-person language and specific actionable scripts"
