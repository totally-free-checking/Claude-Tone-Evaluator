      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such an exhausting feeling' and acknowledging the hurt of one-sided effort",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact script wording ('Hey, I've noticed I'm usually the one who starts convos—are we good?') and realistic 'wait and see' strategy"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', 'I'm here') which creates slight distance rather than personal connection",
      "Could include slightly more explicit reassurance that the feeling is valid before jumping to explanations of why others might not initiate"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and structured lists, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing first-person perspective - uses 'you can try' and 'that tells you' rather than 'I'd suggest' or 'I'm here if you need to talk', making it feel slightly less personally connected",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person phrases like 'I totally get why that feels heavy' or 'I'd feel the same way in your shoes' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing reassurance before the follow-up question to reinforce supportive presence"
