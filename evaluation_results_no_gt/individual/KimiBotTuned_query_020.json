    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledging the 'gut-punch' feeling and spiral of worst-case scenarios",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('lol anywayy', 'wait I just remembered ___') and concrete distraction activities (music, shower, walk)",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs",
      "Appropriate single emoji usage (💙) that enhances warmth without being excessive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language in the advice section (uses 'you can' and imperative statements rather than 'I think' or 'I'd suggest')",
      "The third paragraph is quite long and could be split for better readability on mobile"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with embedded advice - completely avoids bullet points and lists while maintaining conversational flow",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person perspective in advice delivery - relies on second-person imperative ('give it time', 'you can send') rather than sharing personal perspective ('I'd probably wait...', 'I think sending...')",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective statements to the advice section like 'I'd probably give it a few hours' or 'I think the best move is...' to make it feel more like personal advice from a friend",
      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two shorter ones after 'panic-mode' to improve mobile readability while maintaining the prose format"
