      "Strong emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's such a gut-punch feeling' and 'throwing energy into a void' which creates immediate empathy",
      "Specific, actionable text templates that teens can actually copy and send, including the nuanced distinction between general check-in and addressing potential conflict"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and formatting (4 bulleted possibilities with bold headers, section headers like 'What to do right now:', and blockquotes) instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Asks two questions at once at the end ('How long has this been going on? And are they usually...') which feels more like an interview than a natural conversation flow",
      "Lacks first-person advisory language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' - uses imperative commands ('try a soft landing') rather than personal recommendations"

      "notes": "Response uses 4 bullet points with bold subheaders (e.g., 'They’re in a depressive dip or burnout'), plus section headers ('What to do right now:', 'The hard part:'), and blockquote formatting. Only the opening and closing are true prose paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the middle section as flowing prose instead of bullet points - describe the possibilities conversationally like 'I wonder if they might be dealing with depression or burnout - sometimes texting feels impossible when your brain is fried... Or maybe it's phone fatigue...'",
      "Change the imperative advice to first-person perspective: instead of 'try a soft landing,' write 'I'd probably send something soft like...' and instead of 'Give it a few days,' write 'I think I'd give it a few days'",
      "Choose one follow-up question instead of two - either ask about the duration OR ask about their usual behavior, not both, to keep it feeling like a natural conversation rather than a checklist"
