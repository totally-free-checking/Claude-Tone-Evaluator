      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual, empathetic language ('Ugh, that really hurts, doesn't it?' and 'such a crappy, confusing spot to be in')",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout ('I've been there', 'If I were you, I'd...') creating authentic connection",

      "Lacks an explicit 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar ongoing support offer at the end, relying only on the question for engagement",
