    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation ('Oof, that really stings') that immediately acknowledges the emotional pain",
      "Provides excellent specific advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('Hey, I saw you all hung out the other day...')",
      "Ends with a highly specific, natural follow-up question that invites further conversation about the details"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') creating an impersonal, instructional tone",
      "Jumps quickly from brief validation to structured advice without enough emotional support"

      "notes": "Response uses bold headers within bullet points and bold formatting for the final question. Main content is entirely bulleted lists rather than flowing prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 natural paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd suggest checking...'",
      "Add first-person empathetic statements throughout ('I get why that stings', 'I've been there') to create a conversational connection",
      "Remove bold formatting and headers entirely; let advice flow naturally within sentences rather than as a checklist",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to soften the tone before the practical advice"
