      "Immediate emotional validation using relatable teen language: 'Ugh, that mental replay loop is the *worst*' and 'Your brain just keeps hitting rewind on the most cringe moments'",
      "Natural first-person connection throughout: 'I totally get that' and conversational transitions like 'Here's the thing though'",
      "Excellent boundary-respecting follow-up question: 'What happened, if you don't mind me asking?... Or if you'd rather not get into details, that's cool too'",
