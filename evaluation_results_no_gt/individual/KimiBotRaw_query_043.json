      "Strong immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'gut-punch feeling' and 'alarm bell going off in your head'",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts with exact phrases the teen can use ('Hey, I'm a little confused—earlier you mentioned [X]...')",
      "Excellent follow-up question that contextualizes the advice by asking about the severity of the lie"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers ('**The story doesn't add up approach:**', '**A couple things to keep in mind:**') breaks conversational flow",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal constructions like 'The trick is usually...' and 'Here are a few ways...' instead of 'I think...' or 'I'd suggest...'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bold headers and bullet points into flowing narrative paragraphs - instead of labeling approaches, weave them into sentences like 'If I were you, I'd probably start by saying something like...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout using phrases like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get that' to create the feeling of a supportive friend rather than an advice manual",
      "Remove the bullet list under 'A couple things to keep in mind' and integrate those insights into the narrative flow"
