    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, authentic validation ('Ugh, I'm so sorry') that mirrors how a supportive friend would react, and explicitly normalizes the feeling by stating 'you're not being dramatic for hating it'",
      "Uses natural first-person conditional language throughout ('I'd try catching them,' 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal connection rather than detached advice",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts for different scenarios (parents vs. siblings) including exact phrases the teen can use and alternative methods like texting if verbal confrontation feels too scary"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from an explicit 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar first-person availability statement to reinforce the supportive relationship",
      "The emoji (😅) while appropriate for the awkwardness of the situation, could potentially feel slightly minimizing to the 'humiliating' feeling mentioned, though contextually it works"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, allowing advice to flow conversationally within paragraphs as if texting with a supportive older sibling",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing explicit first-person availability language like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or 'I get it' that would strengthen the personal connection beyond the apology and advice",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice is integrated naturally into paragraph flow using conditional sentences ('If it's a parent... I'd try') rather than structured recommendations."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief first-person availability statement like 'I'm here if you want to talk more about this' at the end to reinforce the supportive relationship",
      "The specific scripts provided are excellent—maintain this level of concrete, actionable language for what to say in difficult conversations"
