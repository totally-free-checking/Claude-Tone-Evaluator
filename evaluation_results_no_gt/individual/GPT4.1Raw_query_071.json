      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, making it feel like a real conversation",
      "Good use of first-person language ('I'm really sorry', 'I'm here to help') that establishes personal connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks concrete practical advice - only offers to give advice later rather than providing an immediate actionable tip",
      "Follow-up question is wordy and formal ('If you'd like, you can tell me...') rather than direct and casual",
      "Missing casual teen-appropriate language markers (like 'Ugh', 'Honestly', or 'That sucks') that would make it feel more like a peer"

      "Replace 'If you'd like, you can tell me more...' with something more direct like 'What's making you feel this way?' or 'Is it a specific subject or just everything piling up?'",
      "Add one concrete, immediate suggestion before asking the question, such as 'Have you tried reaching out to the teacher yet? Even a quick email can help' or 'Sometimes breaking it into 20-minute chunks makes it less scary'",
      "Inject more casual warmth at the start like 'Ugh, that sinking feeling is the worst' or 'I totally get that panic' before the validation"
