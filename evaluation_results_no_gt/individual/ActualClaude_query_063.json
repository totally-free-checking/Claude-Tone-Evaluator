    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oh no, that's so awkward!' followed by normalization ('we've all been there')",
      "Excellent natural first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I bet everyone forgot')",
      "Perfect emoji usage with one well-placed 😅 that enhances the warm, casual tone without being excessive",
      "Highly engaging, specific follow-up question about how they handled the exit ('act like you're looking for someone' vs 'own it')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice is limited to perspective-shifting (which is good) but lacks concrete 'next time' or 'if you see them again' strategies",
      "Could benefit from one more first-person supportive closing like 'I'm here if you want to talk more' after the question"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting with zero formatting or structural barriers",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one small practical tip for what to do if they encounter those same students later (like 'If you see them later, you could always joke about being lost')",
      "Add a brief first-person supportive closing after the question, such as 'I'm here if you want to vent more about it' to reinforce the supportive relationship"
