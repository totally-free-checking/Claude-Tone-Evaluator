    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as a conversation",
      "Strong practical advice that acknowledges teen agency limitations (suggesting parent mediator, locking door, hiding items)",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh no, that sounds really frustrating!') and affirms their right to boundaries ('You deserve to have your space respected')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal constructions like 'Sometimes an honest and calm conversation can go a long way' instead of 'I'd suggest trying...'",
      "Does not end with a question - closes with a statement ('Let me know how you feel...') rather than an engaging follow-up question to continue the conversation",
      "Uses generic phrasing that feels more like advice-column writing than peer support at times"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - reads as continuous conversational text perfect for mobile reading",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language creates distance between the bot and user; feels like reading generic advice rather than receiving support from a specific person who cares",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Uses em-dashes for inline examples which maintains prose flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace impersonal constructions like 'Sometimes an honest and calm conversation can go a long way' with first-person language like 'I'd suggest sitting them down for an honest conversation' or 'I think you should try telling them...'",
      "End with a specific, engaging question rather than a statement - for example: 'Do you think your sibling realizes how much this bothers you, or do they think it's just sibling teasing?' or 'What's the thing you're most worried about them finding?'",
      "While the opening validation is good, adding one warm emoji (like 😤 or 😅) after 'Oh no, that sounds really frustrating!' could enhance the casual, friendly tone without being excessive"
