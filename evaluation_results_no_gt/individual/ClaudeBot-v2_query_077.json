    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were you,' 'I'd gently figure,' 'I care about you') creates genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with visceral language ('stomach-knot feeling,' 'heavy') that normalizes the user's discomfort",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact script wording ('I care about you too much to keep this to myself...') and concrete options (going with them to counselor/parent/coach)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for the awkwardness of the situation, might slightly understate the gravity if the secret involves serious safety concerns",
      "Could potentially use one more validating phrase before transitioning to the problem-solving framework, though the balance is still strong"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more brief validating statement between paragraphs 2 and 3 to create an even smoother transition from emotional support to practical advice",
      "The current emoji usage is appropriate, but for very serious safety topics, you might omit it or use a more serious supportive emoji like 💙 instead to match the gravity while keeping warmth"
