      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd try', 'I'd focus') creating genuine conversational connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that really stings, doesn't it?' and 'gut-punch feeling' that normalizes the teen's experience",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section is slightly longer than validation section, creating a minor imbalance toward solutions over emotional support",

      "Consider adding one more sentence of validation after the first paragraph before moving to the 'brains making moments feel huge' explanation to strengthen the emotional support",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but you could enhance engagement by also asking how they're feeling now after sitting with it for a bit"
