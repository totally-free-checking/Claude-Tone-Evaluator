      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable feeling' and reassurance that they're not being dramatic",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs",

      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' that would make it feel more like a specific person sharing their perspective rather than general advice",
