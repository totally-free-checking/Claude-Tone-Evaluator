    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd just', 'I'm so sorry', 'I totally get why you're upset') which creates genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation in the opening ('Ugh, I'm so sorry', 'that's one of the worst feelings', 'weird mix of anger and helplessness') before moving to advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation with clear paragraph transitions",
      "Specific contextual advice that addresses both school and home scenarios with concrete phrases ('stick to your story', 'when everyone's cooled off')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance the warm, commiserating tone (though none is acceptable for this serious topic, a 😤 or 😅 might have reinforced the 'Ugh' sentiment)",
      "Could slightly condense the advice section to avoid overwhelming the teen, though the length is still reasonable"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural first-person conversational tone that uses 'I think', 'I'd say', and 'I totally get it' throughout, making it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling rather than receiving generic advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of emoji when one might have enhanced the empathetic opening, though this is a minor issue given the serious nature of the complaint",

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with natural transitions between validation, advice for staying calm, school-specific suggestions, home-specific suggestions, and the follow-up question. No headers, bold text, or list formatting used."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😤 or 😅) after 'Ugh' in the opening to visually reinforce the empathetic frustration, though this is optional for serious topics",
      "The advice section could be slightly condensed by combining the school and home paragraphs, but the current length is still appropriate and readable on mobile"
