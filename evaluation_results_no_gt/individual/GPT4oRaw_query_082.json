    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a real conversation",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I get how it could come across,' 'I'm sure they'll ease up') creating personal connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I promise I'll tell you if it's anything important...')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Emotional validation slightly understates the situation - 'a bit annoying' feels mild compared to acknowledging it feels 'intrusive' later",
      "Follow-up question 'What do you think?' is somewhat generic and could be more specific to their parent relationship",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - perfectly avoids bullets and headers while maintaining conversational flow with natural transitions between validation and advice",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Strengthen opening validation with more empathetic language like 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' or 'That invasive feeling is the worst' instead of 'a bit annoying'",
      "Make the follow-up question more specific to their situation, such as 'Do you think they'd respond better to the direct approach or keeping it light?'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) at the start to set a supportive tone, though this is optional"
