    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get that feeling', 'I think this is way more common', 'the coolest people I know') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation with an older sibling or friend",
      "Strong immediate validation that acknowledges the emotional weight ('That can feel really isolating sometimes') before offering perspective"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice, while solid, could include one more concrete 'try this today' action step rather than just the reframe",
      "Though the lack of emoji is appropriate for the tone, adding one warm emoji (like 😊) at the opening could enhance the warmth slightly without being excessive"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting - using contractions, casual phrasing ('kinda overrated', 'capital-T Things'), and flowing paragraphs without any structural formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice section, while empathetic, stays somewhat in the realm of perspective/reframing rather than offering specific concrete actions the teen could take immediately",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph form with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. The advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining a conversational text-message feel throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific micro-action the teen could try today, such as 'Maybe jot down three things that made you lose track of time this week' to make the advice more immediately actionable",
      "The response is excellent overall; if you wanted to add one subtle emoji (like 😊 or 💙) at the very beginning or end, it could enhance warmth, though the current text-only approach works well for this slightly more serious topic"
