    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I've been there', 'I think', 'I'd say') that creates genuine connection and feels like a supportive friend rather than a bot",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with specific physical description ('That little knot in your stomach') that shows deep understanding of the feeling",
      "Provides a concrete, word-for-word script the teen can actually use ('Hey, about what I said earlier...') rather than vague advice to 'just apologize'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one carefully placed emoji (like 😅 or 😬) to enhance the warm, casual tone, though the absence isn't problematic",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use one more validating sentence between the normalization and the 'I think the best thing' to maintain the emotional connection"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses natural contractions, casual phrases ('kinda', 'super simple', 'get weird'), and consistently employs 'I' statements that make it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while zero emojis is acceptable, one well-placed emoji could have enhanced the warmth given the awkward/socially anxious nature of the situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one emoji (like 😅 or 😬) early in the response to visually reinforce the 'awkward realization' feeling and enhance warmth",
      "The follow-up questions are good but could be slightly more open-ended ('What happened?' vs the specific options given) to invite more sharing, though the current approach shows active listening"
