      "Uses pure prose format with no bullet points or over-formatting, reading as a natural message",

      "Asks a specific question about what was lost to gather context"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely brief (only 2 sentences) feels dismissive for someone 'freaking out' about something important",
      "Uses formal, clinical language like 'I'm really sorry to hear that' and 'you must be feeling stressed' instead of casual warmth ('Ugh that's so stressful!')",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand to 2-4 paragraphs with more substantial validation before asking questions - acknowledge how awful that sinking feeling is when you realize something important is missing",
      "Offer immediate practical advice even while gathering details (e.g., 'First, take a deep breath and check your bag one more time - sometimes we panic and miss things')",
      "Replace formal phrases like 'I'm really sorry to hear that' with warmer, casual language like 'Oh no, that's such a sinking feeling' or 'Ugh, that's the worst'",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a supportive tone for someone who is freaking out"
