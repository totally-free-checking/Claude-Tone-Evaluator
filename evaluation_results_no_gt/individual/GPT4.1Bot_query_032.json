    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I've totally been in that spot before,' 'If I were you, I'd try reaching out') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling' and acknowledging the specific anxiety of second-guessing",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses 'honestly' twice which is slightly repetitive though not disruptive",
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😕) to enhance warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the serious topic"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The conversational tone and first-person perspective ('I get it,' 'I'd say') makes it feel like a real person rather than an AI giving generic advice",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than listed."

      "Consider varying transitional words slightly to avoid repetition of 'honestly'",
      "The specific script provided ('Hey, I've noticed things feel off—did I do something?') is excellent - keep providing these concrete phrases teens can actually use"
