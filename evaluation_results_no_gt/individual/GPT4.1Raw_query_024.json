    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'I'm sorry—that stings' and acknowledgment that 'It's tough to feel left out'",
      "Ends with an engaging question ('Want to talk about it?') and supportive closing ('Whatever you need, I'm here')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it'—uses generic phrasing like 'Sometimes just sharing how you're feeling can help' instead of personal connection",
      "Offers to 'brainstorm ways to approach your friends' rather than providing one specific actionable suggestion upfront",
      "Missing emoji that could enhance warmth for this emotional situation (e.g., a gentle 💙 or 😔)"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, reading like a text message rather than a structured guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone lacking first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say') making it feel slightly like a generic counselor response rather than a supportive friend",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection, such as 'I'd feel so hurt if that happened to me' or 'I think the worst part is not knowing why'",
      "Include one warm, supportive emoji like 💙 or 😔 to match the emotional weight of being left out",
      "Provide one concrete suggestion before offering to brainstorm, such as 'Maybe start by texting the friend you're closest with and just saying you felt a little left out?'"
