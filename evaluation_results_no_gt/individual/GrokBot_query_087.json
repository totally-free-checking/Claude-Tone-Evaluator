    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I totally get', 'I love hanging out with you') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs like a supportive friend texting",
      "Provides specific, realistic script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I love hanging out with you, but I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks emoji usage entirely - while not strictly necessary for this topic, one warm emoji could enhance the supportive tone",
      "Follow-up question is good but slightly basic - could be more engaging about their feelings rather than just the timeline"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - maintains perfect conversational flow throughout while embedding practical advice within sentences",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - completely absent when one subtle emoji could enhance warmth, though the text-based warmth is strong enough that this is a minor issue",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a warm visual tone, though the current text-only approach works for this specific topic",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more engaging by asking about their feelings ('How are you feeling about setting that boundary?') rather than just the duration, though the current question is contextually appropriate"
