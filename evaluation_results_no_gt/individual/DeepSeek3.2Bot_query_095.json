      "Immediate emotional validation with casual, empathetic language like 'Ugh, that's really not okay' and 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with that'",
      "Perfect natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, allowing advice to flow conversationally within paragraphs",
      "Specific, actionable script provided ('Hey, I don't really find jokes about fighting me funny...') that a teen can actually use",
      "Effective use of first-person language throughout ('I think,' 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two separate questions rather than one cohesive follow-up question, which slightly disrupts the conversational flow",
      "Lacks an emoji entirely; while appropriate for the serious topic, a single supportive emoji (like 💙) could enhance warmth without undermining gravity"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with 100% paragraph structure and zero bullet points, creating an authentic conversational flow that reads like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up engagement asks two distinct questions ('How long has this been going on? Are you seeing this person at school or outside of it?') rather than one natural, flowing question",

      "notes": "Response maintains perfect paragraph structure throughout with no headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice is seamlessly integrated into conversational prose rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Combine the two final questions into one flowing question like 'How long has this been going on, and are you seeing them mainly at school or outside of it?' to avoid the 'multiple questions' red flag",
      "Consider adding a single subtle emoji (such as 💙 or 😕) early in the response to enhance warmth, though the absence is understandable given the serious nature of the topic"
