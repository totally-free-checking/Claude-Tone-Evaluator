    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the conversation ('Hey, I noticed you seemed mad...') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include slightly more emotional validation before moving to the 'friendships can get jealous' explanation",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt though still effective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses natural casual expressions like 'Ugh', 'Honestly', and 'What's up?' while consistently employing 'I' statements that make it feel like a real supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight assumption about the friend's motivation ('used to being your main hangout buddy') without acknowledging other possible reasons for their anger, though this is a minor issue",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more validating sentence acknowledging how uncomfortable the situation feels before moving to the explanation about jealousy",
      "The specific conversation script provided is excellent - maintain this level of concrete detail in future responses"
