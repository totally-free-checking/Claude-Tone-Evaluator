    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with phrases like 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with that pressure' and 'that's such a heavy weight to carry' that acknowledge the emotional burden",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe try', 'I'm here for you') creating authentic personal connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to parents: 'I'm really trying my best, but when I feel pressure to be perfect, it actually makes me more anxious'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could offer one alternative strategy if the direct conversation approach doesn't work initially",
      "While validation is strong, could explicitly name the stress/anxiety as valid and normal before moving to solutions"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting in conversational paragraphs",

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose with four flowing paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one brief alternative strategy (like involving a school counselor or writing a letter) for teens who find direct conversation too intimidating",
      "The validation is strong but could explicitly affirm that feeling stressed about grades doesn't mean they're not resilient or capable"
