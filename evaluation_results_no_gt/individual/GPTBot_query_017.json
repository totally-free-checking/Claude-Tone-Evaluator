    "strengths": [
      "Excellent specific scripts for talking to the friend ('I wanted to check in because I felt a little uncomfortable when he said/did ___')",
      "Validates the teen's intuition immediately ('Trust that 'weird vibe' a little') and empowers them to set boundaries ('You don't owe anyone access to you')",
      "Comprehensive safety-focused advice that is realistic for a teen's agency (group hangouts, not being alone, watching for isolation patterns)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I'm here' to create personal connection; reads like a safety pamphlet rather than a supportive friend",
      "Severely over-structured with markdown headers (###), numbered lists (1-5), and bullet points throughout instead of conversational prose paragraphs",
      "Opens with validation but immediately jumps to structured advice without emotional warmth ('I'm so sorry,' 'That must feel so awkward') or relatable personal acknowledgment"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality and specific safety scripts provided are exemplary - the response gives concrete, actionable phrases the teen can actually use and realistic boundaries they can set immediately",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is completely misaligned with the conversational prose style - it uses 5 numbered sections with sub-bullets, headers, and lists rather than natural paragraph flow, reading like a wiki article instead of a text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 15,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses ### headers, numbered lists 1-5, and extensive bullet points under each section. Only 1-2 sentences at the beginning and end are in prose form. The follow-up questions are even formatted as a bullet list rather than a natural sentence."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 flowing paragraphs without any numbered lists or headers; integrate the advice naturally into sentences like 'I think jotting down what specifically felt off might help you figure out if it's a red flag or just general dislike'",
      "Add warm, empathetic opening like 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable spot to be in' and use first-person language throughout ('I'd say trust that gut feeling,' 'I'm really glad you're paying attention to this')",
      "Replace the list of three questions at the end with one natural follow-up like 'What exactly happened that gave you that weird vibe?'"
