      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I'd say', 'I know') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to counselor ('I'm torn on electives – any recs based on what I like?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen validation of the 'behind' feeling before reassuring that others are scrambling too",
      "The transition from emotional validation to practical advice, while smooth, could use one more bridging sentence about the feelings being valid"
