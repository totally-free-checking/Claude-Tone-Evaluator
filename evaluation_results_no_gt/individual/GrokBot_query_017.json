    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you', 'I'd start', 'I think') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate validation using specific empathetic phrases like 'totally valid to feel weird' and 'you're not overreacting'",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice including specific script ('How's everything going with [boyfriend's name]?') and realistic steps for teens"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen validation by acknowledging how scary or awkward it feels to navigate suspicions about a friend's partner",
      "Might benefit from briefly acknowledging that bringing this up with friends can be risky or that the friend might get defensive"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one sentence acknowledging that it's really hard/scary to bring up concerns about a friend's partner because you don't want to damage the friendship",
      "The emoji usage is perfect at one well-placed 😅, though for potentially serious safety situations, consider if a more neutral supportive tone might be appropriate, or balance with a 💙 to show care"
