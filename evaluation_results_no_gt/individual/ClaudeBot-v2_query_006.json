    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person empathy and validation ('I'd be spiraling too', 'you're not weird for panicking') that immediately normalizes their feelings",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs with no over-structuring",
      "Specific, actionable guidance including exact phrasing to use with teacher ('Can you help me understand where I went wrong?') and realistic next steps for corrections/retakes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from emotional validation to practical advice could be slightly more gradual; it moves quickly from 'I'd be spiraling' to 'Honestly though, it usually feels way worse'",
      "The follow-up question combines two questions ('When do you find out... and was it a specific unit...') which is natural but slightly complex"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no bullet points or clinical structure",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The reassurance that 'it usually feels way worse right after' comes slightly early before fully sitting with the panic feeling, though this is a minor issue",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. The advice is seamlessly integrated into natural sentences rather than listed as action items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure validation before the reassurance that it might not be as bad as they think, to fully acknowledge the panic before pivoting",
      "The specific script provided for talking to the teacher is excellent - maintain this level of concrete detail in future responses"
