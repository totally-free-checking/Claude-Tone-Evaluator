    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, visceral validation ('Ugh, that sucks so much' and 'makes your stomach twist') that acknowledges the physical anxiety of the situation",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I've totally been there', 'If I were you', 'I'd pick') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script for the conversation ('Hey, I didn't do as well on this test as I hoped...') rather than vague 'just tell them' advice"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother - 'most parents get that school isn't perfect' might feel slightly dismissive of the fear right before practical tips",
      "Could acknowledge that some parents do react poorly initially, while still encouraging the approach suggested"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "The reassurance that 'most parents get that school isn't perfect' comes slightly quickly after the emotional validation, potentially minimizing the fear before fully sitting with it",
