    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that stings' and acknowledging the difficulty of holding it together",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I get it', 'If I were in your shoes', 'I'd give myself') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points—reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Specific validation of the 'I'm fine' mask experience which directly addresses the user's situation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice, while realistic, could include one more specific coping strategy (like talking to a friend or journaling) beyond passive activities",
      "The 😅 emoji fits the 'trying to act fine' masking aspect but may slightly underplay the genuine disappointment for some users"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and first-person perspective—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than an AI giving instructions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice specificity—while the self-care suggestions are appropriate, they lean slightly generic and could include more targeted strategies for processing rejection",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific social or reflective action (like 'texting a friend who gets it' or 'writing down what you're feeling') to complement the passive self-care suggestions",
      "The current emoji choice works for the masking context, but a 💙 or 😔 might alternatively validate the disappointment more directly while maintaining warmth"
