    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation: 'That really sucks to be stuck hearing it from your room. You shouldn’t have to carry that' acknowledges the emotional weight immediately",
      "Provides excellent specific actionable advice including exact phrases to text friends, specific breathing counts (in 4, hold 2, out 6), and concrete hotline numbers"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and formatting (headers like 'Quick ways to get through the moment', bold text throughout) makes it read like a safety pamphlet rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Lacks first-person conversational language - no use of 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' - instead uses imperative instructional tone throughout"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality is exemplary, offering realistic immediate coping strategies (brown noise, ice cubes) and safety planning that respects teen agency",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is extremely over-structured with multiple bullet lists and bold headers, completely diverging from the natural prose paragraphs ideal",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses extensive bullet formatting with section headers ('First:', 'Quick ways:', 'If you feel able:', 'For after:') and bold text throughout, resembling a crisis resource guide rather than conversational text"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation, e.g., 'If I were you, I'd probably put on some headphones with brown noise or turn on a fan to mask the sound...'",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout, such as 'I can't imagine how stressful that must be to hear' or 'I'd feel really overwhelmed too', rather than jumping straight to safety instructions",
      "Reduce the bold text and headers - instead of '**First: are you safe right now?**', try 'First off - are you safe right now? I need to make sure you're okay...'"
