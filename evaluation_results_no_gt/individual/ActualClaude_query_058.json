    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate validation with 'I totally get that! It's super normal to feel nervous' which acknowledges the feeling as common and valid",
      "Practical advice is realistic and teen-appropriate, such as 'You can start small and share only what you're comfortable with' and 'You're totally in control of how much or how little you want to share'",
      "Good balance between emotional support and actionable suggestions, ending with encouraging validation about courage"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bulleted list with 4 items ('A few things that might help ease your nerves:') which breaks the conversational prose format ideal for this character",
      "Asks multiple questions at once ('What's making you feel most nervous about it? Is it worry about what to say, concern about confidentiality, or just the whole idea of opening up to someone new?') rather than one natural follow-up",
      "Lacks first-person advisory language like 'I'd suggest' or 'I think' when giving advice, using impersonal 'You can' statements instead"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the suggestions are specific, realistic for a teen's agency, and immediately actionable",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response relies on a structured bullet list rather than flowing conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "65%",
      "notes": "Response contains one prominent bulleted list with 4 items that interrupts the conversational flow. The advice is delivered in list format rather than integrated into natural sentences as required by the ideal character profile."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose by integrating the advice into sentences: instead of 'You can start small...' as a bullet, try 'I'd suggest starting small and sharing only what you're comfortable with. Counselors have literally heard it all, so nothing will shock them, and you're totally in control of how much you want to share.'",
      "Consolidate the multiple questions into one natural follow-up question rather than offering three options at once - for example, 'What's making you feel most nervous about it?' and let them answer before prompting further",
      "Incorporate more first-person language when giving advice, such as 'I'd say' or 'I think the best approach would be' to create a more personal, friend-like connection rather than impersonal directives"
