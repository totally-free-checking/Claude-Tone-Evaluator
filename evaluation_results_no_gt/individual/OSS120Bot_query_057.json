    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text message",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'd suggest', 'I can hear', 'we've all been through') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen can use when talking to the teacher ('Hey, could you help me understand...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Second paragraph contains slightly minimizing language ('it usually feels bigger in the moment than it actually is') which could unintentionally dismiss the teen's valid frustration",
      "Could offer slightly more emotional validation in the middle section before transitioning to practical solutions"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

      "Remove or rephrase the minimizing language about feelings being 'bigger in the moment than it actually is' - instead try something like 'That frustration can feel really overwhelming when it first happens'",
      "Add one more validating sentence before moving to advice, such as 'You deserve to understand what happened' to reinforce that the teen's confusion is valid"
