      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry—that's genuinely humiliating' and relatable language like 'wanna disappear on the spot'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd try,' 'I get,' 'I'm so sorry') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to the coach: 'Hey, I get what you were trying to correct, but getting yelled at in front of everyone really embarrassed me...'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, reading like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji slightly mismatches the intensity of 'genuinely humiliating'—😓 or 😬 might better capture the embarrassment",
      "Could include one additional sentence of pure emotional validation before transitioning to the 'teammates aren't judging you' reframing"

      "Consider using 😓 or 😬 instead of 😅 for intense humiliation scenarios to better match the emotional weight",
      "Add one more validating phrase like 'That feeling of wanting to sink into the floor is the worst' before moving to the perspective shift about teammates"
