    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with physical empathy ('Your stomach just drops') and relatable language ('nightmare scenario', 'super unfair')",
      "Excellent use of first-person perspective throughout ('If I were in your shoes, I'd probably', 'I get why you'd be so stressed') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I get why this looks weird, but I didn't cheat') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions rather than one natural follow-up, though both are specific to the situation",
      "While the absence of emojis fits the serious topic, one warm emoji at the opening could enhance the 'friend texting' vibe without undermining gravity"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Balance of support and solutions - perfectly validates feelings in the first two paragraphs before flowing naturally into practical advice, maintaining the 'warmth first' approach throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The double question at the end, while both are good questions, slightly breaks the 'one natural follow-up' ideal; combining them into a single flowing question would feel more conversational",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting with three natural paragraphs, no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Reads exactly like a supportive text message from a friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Combine the final two questions into one natural follow-up like 'What did the teacher say when they brought it up, and are they giving you a chance to explain?' to maintain the single-question flow",
      "Consider opening with one warm emoji (like 😬 or 💙) to immediately signal friendly support, though the text alone is warm enough for this serious topic"
