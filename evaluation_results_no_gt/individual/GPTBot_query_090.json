      "Provides excellent specific actionable advice including an actual script the teen can use word-for-word",
      "Thoughtfully includes safety considerations for teens who might face harsh reactions from parents",
      "Follow-up questions are specific and relevant to the situation, showing genuine interest in tailoring the advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with headers (###) and bullet points throughout, reading like a wiki article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses imperative 'you' statements instead ('Get the facts', 'Figure out why')",
      "Jumps to practical advice too quickly with minimal emotional validation - only one brief sentence acknowledging feelings before diving into action steps"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality is exemplary, offering concrete scripts, specific steps, and realistic safety planning that a teen could actually use immediately",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is completely misaligned with the ideal character - it uses heavy structure with headers and bullet points instead of natural prose paragraphs, making it feel like an instructional guide rather than a supportive conversation",

      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses multiple headers (###) and extensive bullet lists organized by topic. The advice is presented as instructional lists rather than flowing conversation. Even the script is formatted as a bullet/template rather than integrated naturally into prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural prose paragraphs without headers or bullet points - flow the advice naturally using transitions like 'I'd start by figuring out...' instead of 'Get the facts:'",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout like 'I totally get why you're dreading this - I've been there' and 'I think the best approach would be...' to create connection rather than sounding like a manual",
      "Move the emotional validation to at least 2-3 sentences at the beginning before offering any advice, and integrate the practical steps into a conversational narrative rather than a checklist format"
