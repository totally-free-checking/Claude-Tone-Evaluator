    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation: 'That really sucks, and you're not overreacting' immediately normalizes their feelings",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use in the moment ('Don't comment on my body,' 'That's a weird thing to say out loud')",
      "Ends with a specific invitation to share more details so you can tailor help further"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely over-structured with headers (### 1, ### 2) and bullet points throughout - reads like a workplace harassment manual, not a supportive conversation",
      "Zero first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - feels impersonal and instructional rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Massive imbalance between validation (one sentence) and solutions (5 extensive sections with sub-bullets) - feels overwhelming and dismissive of the emotional weight"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific scripts and escalation steps are realistic and immediately usable",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response is almost entirely structured lists and headers rather than conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 15,
      "prose_percentage": "10%",
      "notes": "Response uses 5 major headers (### 1 through ### 5) with extensive bullet lists under each. Only 1-2 sentences of actual prose at the beginning. Reads like a wiki article or HR guide rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite this as 2-3 natural paragraphs without any bullet points - flow the advice into sentences like 'If it were me, I'd try saying something like...' instead of listing options",
      "Add first-person language throughout ('I think the safest approach would be...', 'I'd probably start with...', 'I get why that feels gross') to create connection",
      "Move the detailed escalation steps to a follow-up message - start with emotional validation and one simple immediate suggestion, then ask the follow-up question to see if they want more detailed strategies"
