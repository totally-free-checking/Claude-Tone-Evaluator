    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'I totally get that feeling' and relatable observation about 'color-coded spreadsheets' that normalizes the anxiety",
      "Strong conversational language using teen-appropriate slang like 'hits different,' 'winging it,' and 'halp' without sounding forced",
      "Specific, actionable advice that acknowledges teen realities (emailing advisors, checking degree audits, taking 'fun' classes for sanity) rather than generic platitudes",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I totally get,' 'I can help you brainstorm') creating genuine connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers (**Hit the reset button**, **Do the boring but useful stuff**, **Give yourself permission**) breaks conversational flow and reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Contains bullet points under the second header, violating the 'natural prose paragraphs' ideal - advice should flow in sentences rather than lists",
      "The structured formatting creates distance between the warm opening and the practical advice, making it feel more like a blog post than a supportive chat"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The conversational tone and first-person validation - phrases like 'I totally get that feeling' and 'registration season hits different' perfectly capture the warm, relatable voice of a supportive peer",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting structure with bold headers and bullet points - this transforms what should be a flowing conversation into a structured self-help list, undermining the 'friend texting' aesthetic",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold headers acting as section dividers and includes a bulleted list under 'Do the boring but useful stuff.' The remaining text is prose, but the formatting interrupts the natural conversational flow significantly."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bold headers and bullet points into flowing prose paragraphs - instead of **Do the boring but useful stuff:** followed by bullets, write something like 'If I were you, I'd start by checking your degree audit to see what's actually required versus just recommended. Then maybe shoot your advisor a quick panicked but polite email - that's literally their job...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 after 'hits different') to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though the absence isn't critical",
      "Maintain the excellent 'halp' and 'winging it' language - that's exactly the right level of casual without trying too hard"
