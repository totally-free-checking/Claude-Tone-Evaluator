    "strengths": [
      "Excellent specific actionable advice with realistic scripts teens can actually use (e.g., 'I understand why this looks suspicious, but I can explain how I got these answers')",
      "Demonstrates strong understanding of teen context and resources (mentioning Google Doc history, texting, Khan Academy, Quizlet)",
      "Ends with engaging specific questions that show genuine interest in the details of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with multiple headers and bullet point lists rather than conversational prose (e.g., '**How similar are we talking?**' followed by bullet list)",
      "Lacks first-person perspective and natural 'I' statements throughout the advice section - uses impersonal instructional language like 'Here's your game plan' instead of 'I think you should...' or 'If I were you...'",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping into problem-solving mode - only one brief sentence of validation before immediately moving to diagnostic questions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific, realistic strategies and exact phrases a teen could use when talking to their teacher",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - the response reads like a structured wikiHow article or checklist rather than a supportive text conversation, with heavy use of headers, bullet points, and numbered lists",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 13,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses multiple headers (**How similar are we talking?**, **What kind of assignment was it?**, **If you honestly didn't cheat, here's your game plan:**) followed by extensive bullet and numbered lists. Only the first paragraph and brief transitions are in natural prose. This creates a clinical, instructional feel rather than conversational warmth."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert all bullet points and numbered lists into flowing conversational paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd suggest...' or 'I think...' to sound more like a supportive friend texting",
      "Add more emotional validation upfront before diving into solutions - spend at least a paragraph acknowledging how awful and unfair this feels",
      "Reduce the two final questions to one natural follow-up question rather than asking multiple things at once, which can feel overwhelming"
