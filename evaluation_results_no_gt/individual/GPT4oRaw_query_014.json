    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact script the teen can use: 'Hey, was that something just between us? I want to make sure I respect your privacy'",
      "Validates the situation immediately by acknowledging it's 'tricky' and that the friend trusted them"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - the response just stops without inviting the teen to share more or continue the conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely (no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making the advice feel impersonal and detached rather than like a friend sharing perspective",
      "Uses formal distance phrases like 'The golden rule here is' and 'it's best to honor' instead of personal connection"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing follow-up question - fails to end with an engaging question to continue the conversation, which is essential for the teen support character",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with natural flow. Uses a separator line (---) at the end but no actual bullet points or numbered lists. Advice is integrated naturally into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end like 'How are you feeling about keeping this secret?' or 'Is it something that's been weighing on you?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout, such as 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd say you should...' or 'I get why that feels awkward' to create personal connection",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the supportive tone, though this is less critical than the missing first-person language and question"
