      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst!' that mirrors the teen's frustration and validates their reaction",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I get why', 'I'd say') creating genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice section, while good, could offer one more specific in-the-moment strategy for immediate emotional regulation",

      "Consider adding one more specific grounding technique (like the 5-4-3-2-1 method or box breathing) for when they want to actually calm down later",
      "The emoji choice is appropriate, but for intense anger situations, consider 💙 or 😊 for warmth, though 😅 works well for the 'frustrated disbelief' tone"
