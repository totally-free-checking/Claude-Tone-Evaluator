      "Excellent use of first-person language with phrases like 'I'd say' and 'totally get it' that create genuine connection",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact conversation starters ('Hey, I don't know many people here—what brought you?') that teens can actually use",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question combines two queries ('What's the event like, and how well do you know...') which is slightly less focused than a single engaging question",
      "Could potentially include one more 'I' statement early on (like 'I remember feeling this way') to strengthen the personal connection before giving advice"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or bold headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider focusing the follow-up question on one specific aspect (either the event type OR the relationship with the inviter) to make it feel less like an interview and more like natural curiosity",
      "The validation is strong but could be slightly more immediate with an 'I'm here' or 'I've been there' type statement to reinforce that you're personally invested in their situation"
