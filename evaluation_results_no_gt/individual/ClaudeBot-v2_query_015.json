      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('I'd be ready to snap too', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'I'm so sorry')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact script wording the teen can use ('I'm not okay with you going through my things...')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched with the word 'infuriating' (😅 typically conveys nervousness/awkwardness rather than anger/frustration)",
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense - could benefit from being broken into two smaller paragraphs for better readability on mobile"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow with consistent first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say', 'If I were you') that makes it feel like a real person rather than an AI",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection doesn't perfectly match the emotional intensity described (using a nervous/awkward emoji for an 'infuriating' situation)",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😤 or 😠 instead of 😅 when describing anger/frustration, or omit the emoji entirely for serious boundary violations",
      "Break the third paragraph (advice section) into two smaller paragraphs after the quoted script to improve mobile readability while maintaining prose format",
      "Continue the excellent use of 'If I were you' and 'I'd' phrasing - this first-person approach is exactly what makes the response feel supportive and personal"
