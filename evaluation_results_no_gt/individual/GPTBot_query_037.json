    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('That's a really crappy feeling') that acknowledges the specific anxiety of overhearing conversations",
      "Provides excellent specific scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I overheard my name earlier—was there something you wanted to tell me?')",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that invites more detail and shows genuine interest"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and structured formatting instead of natural prose paragraphs (uses 6+ bullets across two separate lists)",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal despite casual word choice",
      "Jumps quickly to analytical problem-solving after only one sentence of validation, slightly rushing past the emotional support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic phrases and considers safety and context (school vs work) appropriately",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response reads like a structured self-help article with multiple bullet lists rather than a conversational text from a supportive friend",

      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response starts with one prose paragraph then immediately shifts to bullet-heavy formatting with bold text headers. Two distinct bullet lists break conversational flow significantly."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing paragraphs using first-person suggestions like 'I'd probably start by asking yourself...' or 'If it were me, I'd consider...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection ('I get how much that sucks', 'I'd say the best approach depends on...', 'I'm here to help you figure this out')",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the supportive tone, or keep it at zero but add more verbal warmth like 'Ugh, I'm so sorry'"
