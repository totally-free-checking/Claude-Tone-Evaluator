      "Opens with immediate, strong validation: 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'There's nothing worse than when your parents suddenly crack down' perfectly captures the teen's feelings",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout like 'I'd maybe try' and 'Honestly,' creating a supportive peer-like voice rather than an authority figure",
      "Provides specific, realistic conversation scripts the teen can actually use: 'I noticed you guys seem more concerned about...' and 'I'm confused about the new rules'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched for expressing frustration (it typically conveys nervousness/embarrassment rather than empathy for annoyance)",
      "Could include slightly more emotional validation before explaining parental psychology (the 'maybe they're stressed about work' section, while helpful, comes quickly after only one paragraph of validation)"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😊 or 💙 instead of 😅, or omitting the emoji entirely, since 😅 implies nervous laughter which doesn't quite match the frustration being validated",
      "Add one more sentence of pure emotional validation before the explanation of why parents get strict (e.g., 'That feeling of being watched constantly is exhausting') to strengthen the support-to-solutions ratio"
