      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the absolute worst feeling' and acknowledging it feels 'unfair and frustrating'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get it', 'If I were you', 'I'd take') creating genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji 😅 (grinning with sweat) may feel slightly mismatched for the serious emotional weight of being falsely accused, potentially coming across as too light",
      "The phrase 'these mix-ups happen more often than you think' risks minimizing the teen's specific situation before fully sitting with their feelings"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😕 or 😔 instead of 😅 for situations involving unfair blame, as the sweat-smile emoji implies awkwardness rather than the hurt of injustice",
      "The transition from validation to advice is good, but could pause slightly longer on the emotional impact before normalizing with 'these mix-ups happen'"
