    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd maybe try', 'I get why you're mad', 'I work well') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact script the teen can use with their teacher: 'Hey, I was wondering if there's a reason for the seat change? I work well with my friends'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with an older sibling"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The shift to 'teachers do this stuff all the time' and 'it's not personal' comes slightly quickly after validation - could use one more sentence acknowledging the frustration before offering perspective",
      "The phrase 'it feels way bigger in the moment than it probably is' could potentially minimize the teen's feelings, though the intent is clearly supportive"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational first-person voice - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no structural formatting or bullet points",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight tendency to normalize the teacher's behavior immediately after validation, which could feel dismissive to a teen who is still processing the anger",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or bullet lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one more sentence of pure emotional validation before offering the perspective that 'teachers do this all the time' to ensure the teen feels fully heard before being asked to consider the teacher's viewpoint",
      "Consider softening 'it feels way bigger in the moment than it probably is' to something like 'it feels huge right now, and that's totally valid' to avoid any hint of minimizing the feeling"
