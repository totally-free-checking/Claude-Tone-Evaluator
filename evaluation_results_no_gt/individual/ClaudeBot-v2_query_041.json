    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that sucks') and normalizes the feeling ('you're not being dramatic, honestly')",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout ('I'd check,' 'I'd see,' 'you can keep it super casual') to feel like personal advice from a friend",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I forgot my lunch… do you have anything small I could buy/borrow? I'll get you back tomorrow')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for the 'trying not to be dramatic' context, might slightly underplay the stress of being hungry at school for some teens",
      "Could include one more explicit 'I'm here' or supportive closing statement before the question to reinforce emotional safety"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive text message from an older sibling or friend, with advice flowing organically within conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight missed opportunity for even stronger first-person connection phrases like 'I get it' or 'I've been there' to deepen the personal bond, though 'I'd check' and 'I'd see' are present",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Advice is woven naturally into conversational sentences rather than listed out"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief 'I've totally been there' or similar first-person relatability statement to strengthen the peer-connection aspect",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be preceded by a brief validating sign-off like 'I'm here to help you figure this out' to sandwich the practical advice with warmth"
