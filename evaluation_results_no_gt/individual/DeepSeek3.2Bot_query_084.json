    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'I'm so sorry, that totally sucks' and acknowledging the 'mix of anger and helplessness' as real emotions",
      "Strong first-person language throughout using 'I think,' 'I'd maybe try,' and 'I'm so sorry' creating authentic connection",
      "Specific actionable advice with exact 'I feel' statement scripts ('I feel frustrated because I didn't know that rule') that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reassurance 'I promise this will pass' could potentially minimize the current intensity of feelings, though it follows with validation",
      "Slightly conservative emoji usage - while the single 💙 is appropriate, a 😅 or similar might have enhanced the 'we've all been there' vibe"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and seamless flow between validation, advice, and engagement - reads exactly like a supportive text from an older sibling",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from emotional validation to practical advice could include one more sentence acknowledging the difficulty of the suggested conversation to bridge the gap more smoothly",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or structured formatting. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using phrases like 'I'd maybe try' rather than imperative bullet points."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the excellent use of first-person perspective ('I think,' 'I'd say') as this creates the supportive peer-like relationship",
      "Consider adding one sentence acknowledging that talking to parents can be scary before jumping into the 'I feel' statements script to bridge the emotional-to-practical transition",
      "The specific examples of what to say to parents are exactly the kind of concrete scripting that makes advice actionable for teens - continue providing these word-for-word examples"
