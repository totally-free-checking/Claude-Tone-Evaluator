      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'that stomach-drop moment is so real' and 'I'd wanna disappear too' that create instant solidarity",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrases to say ('Yeah, I grabbed shoes in the dark… bold choice today') and concrete tactics (tucking feet under desk, waiting for bathroom break)",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include slightly more first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to strengthen the personal connection, though it does use 'I'd wanna' and 'I'd just keep'",

      "The response is excellent overall - maintain this level of specific scripting for advice (giving exact words to use) as it helps teens enormously in awkward social situations"
