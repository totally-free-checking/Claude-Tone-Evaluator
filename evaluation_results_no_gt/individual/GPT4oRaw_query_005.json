    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('Ah jeez, rumors can be so frustrating and hurtful. I'm sorry you're dealing with that')",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice with concrete phrases teens can actually use ('Hey, I heard this is going around, and it's absolutely not true')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Response is structured as 8 numbered bullet points with bold headers, reading like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks follow-up question to continue the dialogue",
      "Uses imperative commands ('Stay Calm', 'Address It Directly') instead of first-person perspective ('I'd suggest', 'I think')",
      "Jumps quickly from brief validation to overwhelming list of solutions without conversational flow"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, specific strategies with exact phrasing suggestions that teens can actually implement",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the response is almost entirely formatted as numbered lists with bold headers, completely breaking the conversational flow",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response relies heavily on numbered list format (1-8) with bold subheaders for each point. Only the opening and closing sentences are in prose. This creates a clinical, instructional feel rather than a supportive conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the numbered list into 2-3 natural paragraphs that weave the advice into conversational prose using first-person language like 'I'd probably...' or 'I think you could...'",
      "End with a specific, engaging follow-up question such as 'Do you have any idea who might have started it?' or 'Have you talked to anyone about this yet?'",
      "Reduce the volume of advice from 8 points to 2-3 key suggestions wrapped in empathetic narrative rather than instructional commands",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to soften the tone, or ensure the prose carries more casual warmth to compensate for the lack of emojis"
