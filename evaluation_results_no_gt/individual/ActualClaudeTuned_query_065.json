    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd try', 'I'm gonna') that creates genuine connection and sounds like a supportive friend",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('I'm gonna stay out of this one', 'I don't really want to get involved in that situation')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with natural transitions between validation and advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen validation about the fear of damaging the friendship before moving to solutions, though the current validation is strong",
      "The transition from normalizing the situation to giving advice is slightly abrupt - a brief acknowledgment of how hard boundary-setting can be would strengthen the bridge"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation style with consistent first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') and zero formatting structure - reads exactly like a supportive older sibling texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "While the balance is good, it could spend one more sentence acknowledging the difficulty of potentially upsetting a friend before jumping to the practical scripts",

      "Consider adding one sentence acknowledging the specific fear that setting boundaries might hurt the friendship, before offering the scripts",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be split into two separate questions for easier answering (though the current 'or' construction works well)"
