      "Completely missing a follow-up question to continue the conversation - ends abruptly with 'Hang in there'",
      "Uses bullet points and blockquote formatting instead of natural prose paragraphs, breaking conversational flow",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' to create personal connection",

      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end like 'Have you noticed anything else weird going on with them lately?' or 'How long have they been acting like this?' to invite continued conversation",

      "Add first-person language throughout: 'I think the best approach is...', 'I'd probably say something like...', 'I get how confusing that must feel' to sound like a supportive friend rather than an advice column",
      "Open with stronger emotional validation: 'Ugh, that's such a sinking feeling when someone just goes dry on you out of nowhere. I've totally been there and it sucks.'"
