      "Add first-person framing to the advice section (e.g., 'I'd say pay attention...' or 'I think you should look for...') to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "Consider using slightly more specific actionable phrases in the advice, such as suggesting exact conversation starters or specific behaviors to watch for beyond 'do they go out of their way to talk to you'"
