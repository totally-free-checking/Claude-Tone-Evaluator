    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' that acknowledges the pain of being left on read",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd try,' 'I know,' 'your brain') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation between friends",
      "Specific, realistic advice tailored to teen experience (resisting double texts, distracting from phone-watching)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could include slightly more specific examples of distraction activities or what to do if they never respond",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific example of a distraction activity (like 'go make a snack' or 'text a friend') to make the advice more concrete",
      "If offering a follow-up strategy, include a specific phrase they could use later like 'Hey, did you see my text?' to reduce their anxiety about wording"
