    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and acknowledging the isolating feeling of being left out",
      "Strong first-person advice using 'If I were you, I'd...' and 'I promise' which creates genuine connection and makes the advice feel personal rather than prescriptive",
      "Highly specific and actionable suggestions including exact phrases to use ('Is it the location, the people, or the time?') and concrete compromise options"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt; could use one more bridging sentence of emotional support before jumping into the 'If I were you' strategy section",
      "The 'Like:' followed by multiple clauses listing specific details, while still prose, borders on a structured list format that slightly breaks the conversational flow"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural first-person conversational tone that uses 'I'd try,' 'I promise,' and 'If I were you' throughout, making it feel like advice from a supportive older sibling rather than an impersonal bot",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight imbalance toward practical advice over emotional validation - while it opens with warmth, the advice section is substantially longer than the validation section",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph format throughout with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The use of a colon to introduce examples ('Like: where you're going...') functions within natural prose flow rather than as a structured list"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of validation between the reassurance paragraph and the advice paragraph to soften the transition (e.g., 'That said, here are some things that have worked for me...')",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be slightly more open-ended to invite storytelling rather than multiple-choice answers, though the provided options are helpful prompts"
