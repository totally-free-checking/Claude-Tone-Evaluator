    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong immediate validation ('Ugh, that's such a crummy feeling') that acknowledges the specific emotional spiral of self-blame",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact phrases the teen can use ('Hey, I get weird vibes from your parents...' and 'I'm happy to hang, but your mom's comments make me uncomfortable')",
      "Ends with engaging, context-specific questions that show genuine interest in the details of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses four bold headers (**Don't audition...**, **Switch up...**, etc.) that create a structured, article-like format instead of natural conversational flow",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - making it feel like an advice column rather than a friend texting",
      "Missing warm closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk' that would reinforce personal support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic scripts and strategies specifically tailored to teen social dynamics and limited agency",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the four bold headers break the response into a list structure that feels more like a wikiHow article than a supportive text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "75%",
      "notes": "While the content under each section is prose, the use of four bold headers (**Don't audition for their approval**, etc.) creates a heavily structured, list-like format that interrupts natural conversational flow. The headers function similarly to bullet points by segmenting advice into distinct categories."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove the bold headers and integrate the four advice points into flowing paragraphs with transitions like 'I think I'd probably try...' or 'Maybe you could...' to maintain conversational rhythm",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I think the worst part is feeling like you have to perform' or 'I'd say don't audition for their approval' to create the feeling of a friend sharing personal insight",
      "Include a warm, supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to vent more' to reinforce the personal connection and availability for continued conversation"
