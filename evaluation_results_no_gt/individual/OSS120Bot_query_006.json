    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation using physical descriptions of anxiety ('stomach twist,' 'gut-punch feeling') that show deep empathy",
      "Perfect use of first-person inclusive language ('I feel you,' 'we all know,' 'we all have had') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, teen-realistic advice including concrete actions like 'snag you a chance for extra credit' and 'study buddy' that acknowledge actual teen resources"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Final question is slightly compound, asking two things at once ('How are you feeling about reaching out... or do you already have a plan...') rather than one focused follow-up",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji early on (like 😅) to visually signal the casual, friendly tone, though the text warmth is sufficient"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - flows exactly like a supportive friend texting",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Simplify the final question to one focused inquiry (e.g., 'What's your biggest worry about talking to your teacher?') rather than offering an either/or choice",
      "Consider adding one casual emoji after the first sentence (e.g., 😅) to reinforce the warm, informal tone visually"
