      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'd be panicking too', 'I’d go with', 'I'm so sorry') creates genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question assumes the interaction with the teacher already concluded ('when you said you didn't have it'), though the user might still be processing the moment",

      "Consider softening the follow-up question to account for uncertainty about whether the confrontation already happened: 'Did you already have to tell them, or are you bracing for that moment?'",
