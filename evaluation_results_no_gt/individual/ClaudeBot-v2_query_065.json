    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd start...', 'I'm down to talk about literally anything else') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I'm not trying to be mean, but I don't really wanna talk about them like this')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural flow - advice embedded in conversational paragraphs rather than lists"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother - 'If I were you' is good but a brief bridge acknowledging the difficulty of the conversation could enhance flow",
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for 'uncomfortable,' might slightly understate the emotional weight for some teens, though it works well for the 'gross or guilty' framing"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Nothing significantly diverges; if anything, the response could offer one additional sentence of emotional validation about the fear of losing the friendship before moving to solutions",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with quoted dialogue integrated seamlessly into prose. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows as narrative suggestions rather than enumerated steps."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one sentence acknowledging how scary it might feel to set this boundary with a close friend before jumping to the 'If I were you' advice section",
      "The specific phrase examples are excellent - continue providing exact scripts teens can borrow when having difficult conversations"
