      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I think', 'I totally get') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for setting boundaries ('Hey, that joke kinda stung, can we not do that?') rather than vague advice",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that sounds so frustrating') and validates gut instincts"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition between the validation paragraphs and advice paragraph could be slightly smoother with a bridging phrase",
      "Could briefly acknowledge that confronting someone is scary before offering the script, though the casual framing helps"
