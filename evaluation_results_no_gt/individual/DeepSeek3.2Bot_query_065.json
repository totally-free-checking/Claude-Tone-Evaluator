    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Oof, that's such an uncomfortable spot to be in') that acknowledges the specific conflict between loyalty and values",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If it were me', 'I might try') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use ('I'm not really comfortable talking about this—do you want to chat about something else instead?') with actionable context about low-key redirects"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😕 emoji, while appropriate for the uncomfortable topic, is slightly less warm/supportive than alternatives like 😊 or 💙 for opening the conversation",
      "Could include slightly more validation of the specific feelings (e.g., acknowledging guilt or fear of losing the friend) before moving to the solution phase"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using a slightly warmer emoji (like 😊) or omitting it entirely, as 😕 emphasizes the discomfort rather than the supportive presence",
      "Could add one more validating phrase about how common this dilemma is ('So many people deal with this') before transitioning to advice, though the current balance is still strong"
