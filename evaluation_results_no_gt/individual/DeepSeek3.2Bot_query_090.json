      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout creates genuine connection: 'I'd be stressed too,' 'I think almost everyone has been there,' and 'If I were you, I'd maybe try...'",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the difficult conversation: 'I didn't do as well as I hoped on this assignment, and I'm feeling really disappointed about it'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice between paragraphs 2 and 3 could be slightly smoother with a brief bridging sentence",
      "Could acknowledge the specific fear of parental disappointment a bit longer before moving to the solution phase"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational tone combined with consistent first-person perspective ('I'd be stressed,' 'I promise,' 'If I were you') makes this feel like a real supportive person rather than an AI giving instructions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The shift from emotional validation to practical advice happens somewhat abruptly without a soft transition phrase like 'When you're ready to talk about it...' or 'Here's what might help...'",

      "Consider adding a brief transitional phrase between the validation and advice sections to soften the shift from 'parents care about you' to 'tell them sooner'",
