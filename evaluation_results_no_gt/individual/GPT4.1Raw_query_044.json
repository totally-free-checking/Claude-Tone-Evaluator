    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oh, I totally get that' and normalizing language ('it happens to everyone sometimes')",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'I'm not sure right now, but can I come back to this later?'",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero formatting artifacts - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) at the opening to match the 'Oh, I totally get that' energy, though the warmth comes through strongly in text alone",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use a softer bridge like 'If you want some ideas for next time...'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining clear flow and readability",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with natural sentence flow. No lists, headers, bold text, or structural formatting. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than presented as actionable items."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) at the very beginning to visually reinforce the empathetic 'Oh, I totally get that' opening",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific - keep using this pattern of asking concrete details about the situation rather than generic 'How are you feeling?' questions"
