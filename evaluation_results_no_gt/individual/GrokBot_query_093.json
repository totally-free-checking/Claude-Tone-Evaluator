      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I'd start', 'I promise') creating genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition to 'most people are way too wrapped up in their own stuff' in paragraph 2, while true, could potentially feel slightly dismissive of the fear before fully sitting with the emotion",
