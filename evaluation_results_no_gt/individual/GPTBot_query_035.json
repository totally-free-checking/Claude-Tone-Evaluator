    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts for what to say to others (e.g., 'Yeah, I'm disappointed, but I'm going to keep working') and concrete questions to ask the coach",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specific situation ('what sport/activity is it, and did they give any reason?')",
      "Opens with strong emotional validation acknowledging both the sting of rejection and the pressure to hide feelings ('trying to play it cool... both are heavy')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and structured formatting instead of natural prose paragraphs - uses 'A few things that can help right now:' followed by 4 main bullets with sub-bullets",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - speaks in impersonal instructional tone ('A few things that can help', 'totally valid') rather than as a supportive friend sharing personal perspective",
      "Emotional validation is brief (one sentence) before immediately jumping to solution-oriented bullet points, creating an imbalanced feel"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers specific, actionable phrases and questions that are realistic for a teen to use immediately",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the response is heavily structured with approximately 10 bullet points and reads like a self-help article rather than a conversational text",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Uses 4 main bullet points with bold headers, plus 3 sub-bullets under 'script for people' and 3 sub-bullets under 'ask the coach'. Only 2-3 sentences of actual prose at the beginning and end. Over-formatted with bold text throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation, using transitions like 'I think you could try...' or 'Maybe you could...' instead of listing items",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - for example, 'I get how much that stings' or 'I'd say give yourself permission to feel disappointed first'",
      "Expand the emotional validation section before offering solutions - spend a paragraph acknowledging the feelings before moving to 'Here's what I'd suggest' rather than jumping immediately to bullet points"
