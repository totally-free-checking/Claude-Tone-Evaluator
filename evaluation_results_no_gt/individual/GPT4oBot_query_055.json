    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sinking feeling' and 'I totally get how nerve-wracking that can be' which immediately makes the teen feel understood",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact wording they could use ('Hey, I'm not loving how this came across...') rather than vague suggestions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses 2 emojis (😅 and 😊) which slightly exceeds the ideal 0-1 maximum for this character",
      "Lacks explicit first-person advisory language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' in the solution portion—uses 'you could' instead of 'I'd probably'",
      "Ends with two questions rather than one focused follow-up, which could feel slightly overwhelming"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with perfect paragraph flow and zero structural formatting—it captures the texting-a-friend vibe perfectly",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of explicit first-person recommendation framing (like 'I think you should...' or 'I'd say...') in the advice section makes the practical suggestions feel slightly less personal than they could be",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses three natural paragraphs with no bullet points, bold text, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Reduce emoji usage to 0-1 (keeping the 😅 which fits the 'cringe' feeling perfectly) to match the character guideline",
      "Add first-person framing to advice statements, such as 'I think the best move would be...' or 'I'd probably delete it if it were me' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "Combine the two final questions into one open-ended question like 'What's your gut telling you to do about it?' to maintain engagement without overwhelming"
