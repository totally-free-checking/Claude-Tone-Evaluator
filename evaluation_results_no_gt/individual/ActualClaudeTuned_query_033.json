    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's so annoying!' and 'I totally get why you're mad') that makes the teen feel heard",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I know that doesn't make it less frustrating') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation with 4 well-sized paragraphs",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in understanding the context better ('Were you and your friends actually talking a lot, or does it feel like it came out of nowhere?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji choice (😅) suggests nervous laughter/embarrassment which doesn't perfectly match the anger emotion expressed, though it fits the 'unfair situation' context",
      "Advice section shifts to second-person ('you could maybe talk') without using first-person framing like 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you should', making it slightly less personal than the validation section",
      "The phrase 'handle it maturely' could come across as slightly condescending, implying the teen might not be mature, though the intent is to encourage diplomatic behavior"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining readability and warmth throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight shift from first-person connection in validation to more impersonal second-person advice delivery in the third paragraph, missing opportunities for 'I'd probably...' or 'In your shoes, I think...' phrasing",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent use of pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or bold headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😕 or 😔 instead of 😅 when validating anger to better match the emotional tone, or omit the emoji since the prose is already warm enough",
      "Add first-person framing to the advice section like 'I'd probably try talking to them...' or 'I think you could ask...' to maintain the personal connection established in the validation paragraphs",
      "Softening 'handle it maturely' to 'if you feel comfortable approaching them' removes any implication that the teen is immature while keeping the supportive intent"
