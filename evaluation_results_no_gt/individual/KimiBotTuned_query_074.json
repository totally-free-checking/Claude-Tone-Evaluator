      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and acknowledging the 'suffocating' feeling",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact scripts ('Hey, I've noticed the rules got tighter lately...') and realistic negotiation tactics"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal constructions like 'it can help to ask' instead of 'I'd suggest asking'",
      "Could include more explicit supportive statements like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to establish personal connection"
