    "strengths": [
      "Immediate, specific validation that names the exact feeling ('that oh… I'm only getting picked when nobody else is around feeling') and normalizes the experience ('you're not being dramatic')",
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd look...', 'I'd start putting...') that creates genuine connection rather than impersonal prescribing",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I've been feeling kinda like a last-minute option lately...') rather than vague 'just talk to them' advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji following 'gross, heavy way' is slightly mismatched—while it conveys awkwardness, it may unintentionally minimize the pain of the 'heavy' feeling described",
      "The transition from validation to advice ('If I were you...') could be slightly softened with one more validating phrase to ensure the emotional acknowledgment fully lands before problem-solving"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in continuous, flowing paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice placement after describing a painful 'gross, heavy' feeling, which slightly conflicts with the emotional weight being validated",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider whether 😅 is the right emoji for heavy emotional pain—😔, 💙, or simply no emoji might better honor the 'gross, heavy' feeling described",
      "The advice section is strong but could start with one more validating bridge like 'That really sucks, and...' before 'If I were you' to ensure the transition feels fully supportive"
