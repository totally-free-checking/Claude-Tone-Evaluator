    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's awful – I'm so sorry') and vividly describes the 'gut-dropping feeling' to show deep empathy and understanding",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd be super upfront', 'I'm more than happy to') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than distant advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use word-for-word ('I totally understand why it looks weird, but I promise I didn't cheat...') which is exactly what teens need in high-stakes conversations"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'this probably feels bigger to you than it actually is' risks minimizing the teen's legitimate anxiety about academic integrity accusations and potential consequences",
      "Could include slightly more validation about the specific fear of reputation damage or academic record impact before moving to reassurance"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, creating a conversational flow that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight minimization in paragraph 2 suggesting the situation is 'bigger to you than it actually is,' which could feel dismissive to a teen facing serious academic integrity concerns",

      "Consider adding one sentence validating the specific fear and seriousness of having your academic integrity questioned, rather than suggesting it might not be a big deal",
      "Continue offering exact phrases and scripts teens can use in difficult conversations - this is incredibly helpful and reduces anxiety about 'what do I say?'"
