    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'you get your hopes up and then suddenly you're just stuck there' that perfectly captures the disappointment",
      "Specific, actionable script provided for the conversation ('Hey, I've noticed you've been canceling really last minute a lot...') that sounds natural and age-appropriate",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with smooth transitions between validation, context, advice, and engagement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one additional first-person 'I' statement (like 'I think that's really unfair' or 'I'm sorry you're dealing with this') to strengthen the personal connection, though 'I'd say' is used well",
      "The 😅 emoji choice slightly mismatches the 'hurt' emotion described (it connotes awkwardness/nervousness more than disappointment), though it's minor"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight underuse of first-person 'I' statements beyond 'I'd say' - missing opportunities for 'I think' or 'I get it' to deepen the personal connection",

      "Add one explicit first-person validation statement like 'I think that's really unfair to you' or 'I get why you'd feel blown off' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "Consider using 😔 or 😕 instead of 😅 for this specific emotional context, or simply remove the emoji since the validation is already strong without it"
