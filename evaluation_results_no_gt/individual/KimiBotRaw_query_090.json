    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation opening with first-person empathy ('I've totally been there,' 'That pit-in-your-stomach feeling is the worst') that immediately makes the teen feel understood",
      "Natural conversational language throughout with consistent first-person perspective ('I know,' 'I'm here to help') and casual phrasing that sounds like a supportive friend rather than an authority figure",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I need to tell you something that's stressing me out...') and realistic considerations for teen agency"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers ('**Pick a calm moment.**', '**Lead with the truth.**') which breaks the conversational flow and reads more like a self-help article than a text conversation",
      "The header '**Some casual tips for the actual conversation:**' creates an over-structured feel that distances the tone from natural prose",
      "Absence of emojis misses an opportunity to add visual warmth to an anxiety-inducing topic where a single 😅 or 💙 could enhance the supportive tone"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language usage - consistently uses 'I' statements and casual phrasing ('I've totally been there,' 'Here's the thing') that creates genuine connection",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Bullet point formatting - the four bullet points with bold headers represent a significant departure from the ideal prose-only conversational style",

      "notes": "Response shifts from natural paragraphs into a heavily formatted list with bold headers and structured tips, breaking the conversational flow. The section '**Some casual tips for the actual conversation:**' followed by dashes and bold text reads like a checklist rather than friendly advice."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet point section into flowing prose paragraphs (e.g., 'I'd suggest picking a calm moment when they're not rushing around. Then, try leading with the truth by saying something like...') to maintain the conversational texting feel",
      "Remove formatting headers and bold text from the advice section; integrate suggestions naturally into sentences rather than using structural markers like '**Pick a calm moment.**'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (such as 😅 or 💙) early in the response to visually reinforce the empathetic tone for this anxiety-inducing situation"
