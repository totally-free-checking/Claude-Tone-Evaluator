    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, relatable validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's frustrating, I totally get it') that acknowledges the disappointment",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I totally get it', 'I'm noticing') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I've noticed you've had to cancel plans a few times. Is everything okay?') with realistic context about why the friend might be canceling",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though the absence doesn't significantly hurt",
      "Validation, while present, is brief (one sentence) before moving to solutions; could linger slightly longer on the 'that sucks' feeling before offering the fix"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational first-person language—reads like a supportive older sibling texting advice without any corporate formatting or bullet lists",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage—while zero emojis is acceptable, adding one subtle emoji could enhance the warmth slightly for a teen audience, though this is a minor nitpick",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no formatting, headers, or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being broken out into steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 after 'Ugh, that's frustrating') to match teen texting norms and enhance warmth, though the current tone is already warm",
      "Linger slightly longer on the emotional validation—maybe one more sentence acknowledging how annoying it is to get ready or look forward to something before jumping to the solution",
      "The follow-up question 'How's it been making you feel?' is excellent and specific—keep using this approach of ending with open-ended emotional check-ins"
