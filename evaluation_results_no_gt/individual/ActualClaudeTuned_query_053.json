    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think it's totally fair', 'I'd also maybe') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and acknowledging 'it feels like your time doesn't matter'",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact script wording: 'Hey, I've noticed our plans keep getting cancelled and it's honestly bumming me out'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) is slightly mismatched for frustration - it conveys nervousness/awkwardness rather than empathy for being let down",
      "The transition from validation to 'some people are just really bad at planning' could feel slightly minimizing before fully acknowledging the hurt",
      "The advice to 'stop being the one to always initiate' is good but could use a bit more validation about how scary/painful that step feels"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and excellent first-person conversational language that sounds like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - the 😅 doesn't quite match the emotional tone of frustration/disappointment about cancelled plans",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Response flows as 5 natural paragraphs with conversational transitions."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😕 or 😒 instead of 😅, or omitting the emoji entirely, since 😅 suggests nervous laughter which doesn't quite match the frustration of cancelled plans",
      "Add one sentence validating how vulnerable it feels to confront a friend or pull back on initiating before suggesting those strategies",
      "The double question at the end works but could be split into two separate follow-up options to feel less like an interrogation"
