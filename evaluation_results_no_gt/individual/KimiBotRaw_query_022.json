    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts and phrases the teen can actually use in the moment (e.g., 'Oof, that one actually hurt. Can we not do that?')",
      "Strong validation that the friend's behavior is unacceptable ('If it feels like an insult, it probably is', 'that's a them problem, not a you-being-too-sensitive problem')",
      "Ends with natural, specific follow-up questions that show genuine interest in the details of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers violates the natural prose requirement - uses '**Call it out in the moment**' and '**Have the quieter conversation**' headers with bullet lists instead of flowing paragraphs",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal constructions like 'Real jokes punch up' and 'Would they laugh' instead of 'I think real jokes punch up' or 'I'd ask yourself if they'd laugh'",
      "Reads more like an instructional article than a text conversation with a supportive friend due to the structured formatting"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - it gives concrete, realistic scripts and the 'turnaround test' concept that teens can immediately apply",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting structure - using bold headers and bullet point lists instead of natural prose paragraphs makes it feel like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Uses three bold headers (**Call it out in the moment**, **Have the quieter conversation**, **See if they pass the 'turnaround test'**) with bullet lists underneath. The advice sections are entirely formatted as bullets rather than flowing sentences."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs - instead of listing options with bullets, weave them into conversational sentences like 'If you want to call it out in the moment, you could try saying... or if you prefer a quieter approach later, maybe try...'",
      "Add first-person language to create connection - use phrases like 'I think the turnaround test is really revealing' or 'I'd probably start with calling it out in the moment' instead of impersonal directives",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to soften the tone, though the absence isn't a major issue"
