    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling') that acknowledges the specific anxiety of feeling watched",
      "Writes in natural prose paragraphs with excellent conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no formatting distractions",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice realistic for a teen's lunch situation (headphones, scrolling phone, people-watching) that addresses the immediate discomfort"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', 'I'm here') which creates distance rather than the intended personal connection of a support bot",
      "Misses opportunity for emoji usage that could enhance warmth - while zero emojis is acceptable, a single supportive emoji early on could reinforce the casual, friendly tone",
      "Could validate slightly more explicitly before pivoting to the 'most people don't notice' reassurance"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and natural paragraph structure - it perfectly avoids bullet points, headers, and over-formatting to read like a genuine conversational text",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of first-person language throughout the entire response - it never uses 'I' statements to create personal connection or share perspective, making it feel slightly detached despite the casual tone",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice is integrated smoothly into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: instead of 'Most people are way too focused...' try 'I think most people are way too focused...' or 'I'd bet most people are...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to reinforce the supportive tone, or explicitly state 'I'm here if you need to talk' to establish the bot's presence",
      "While the advice is good, start with slightly more explicit validation like 'I'm sorry you're dealing with that right now' before moving to the 'people don't notice' reassurance"
