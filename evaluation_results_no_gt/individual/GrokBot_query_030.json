    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating! I totally get why you're tired of it' that acknowledges the unfairness of the situation",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, such as 'I'd probably just be upfront with them' and 'I totally get,' creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can use: 'Hey, I appreciate you wanting to team up, but I can't keep copying my homework anymore. Maybe we can study together instead?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points—advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question combines two distinct questions ('How long has this been going on, and do you think they'd be cool...'), which is slightly less ideal than a single focused question",
      "While the absence of emojis is acceptable for this topic, adding one warm emoji at the start could enhance the supportive tone slightly"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structured lists—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The compound follow-up question that asks two things at once rather than focusing on one engaging prompt",

      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice is seamlessly integrated into conversational prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider simplifying the follow-up to a single question rather than a compound one, such as 'How do you think they'd react if you suggested studying together instead?'",
      "While not necessary, adding a single emoji like 😅 or 😊 after the opening validation could enhance warmth without feeling excessive"
