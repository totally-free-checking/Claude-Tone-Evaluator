      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable physical description ('pressure knot in your chest') that makes the user feel truly seen",
      "Excellent use of first-person language ('I totally get why you'd want to step away') creating a personal connection rather than distant advice",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😅) early on to enhance warmth, though the absence is acceptable for this serious topic",

      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😅) at the end of the first paragraph to enhance warmth without being excessive",
      "Continue using first-person validation statements like 'I totally get' as they create strong connection; perhaps add one 'I'd say' or 'I think' before advice to strengthen the personal voice even more"
