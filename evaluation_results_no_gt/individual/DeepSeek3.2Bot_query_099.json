    "strengths": [
      "Immediate and deep emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, I'm so, so sorry' and 'I'd feel completely violated too' that create instant empathy",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe try', 'I'd feel') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the conversation ('I know you might have been curious, but when you read my private thoughts without asking...') that a teen could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question, while good, combines two questions which slightly dilutes the focus ('How are you feeling about possibly talking to them, or do you just need some space to process first?')",
      "Could briefly acknowledge that some parents might react defensively to boundary-setting, offering a backup plan if the conversation goes poorly"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, flowing like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight complexity of the final question which offers two paths rather than focusing on one natural follow-up",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, numbered lists, bold headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider simplifying the final question to focus on one specific angle rather than offering an either/or choice, such as 'What feels safer right now—talking to them or just taking time to process?'",
      "Could add one sentence acknowledging that if the parent reacts poorly to boundaries, the teen might need a trusted adult (aunt, counselor) as backup, since not all parents respond well to being confronted"
