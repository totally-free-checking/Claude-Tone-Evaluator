    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation from start to finish",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice for a teen's agency level (suggesting to message the partner and notify the teacher) rather than generic platitudes",
      "Perfect balance between emotional validation ('That's so frustrating!') and actionable steps"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') - uses 'you might want to' and 'sometimes... can' which feels slightly impersonal",
      "Does not end with a question to continue the conversation, though it does ask an engaging question ('Do you want some advice... or just need to vent?') earlier in the response",
      "Could enhance warmth with slightly more empathetic phrasing like 'Ugh, that's so stressful' or 'I'd be panicking too'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational paragraph flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up engagement - fails to end with a question to continue the conversation, closing instead with a statement",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to feel more personal and supportive - instead of 'you might want to let your teacher know,' try 'I'd definitely let your teacher know' or 'I think you should tell your teacher'",
      "End with a specific question to keep the conversation going, such as 'What subject is the project for?' or 'Do you think your partner is just overwhelmed or blowing it off completely?'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 😬) to match the 'frustrated but urgent' tone of the situation"
