      "Immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable spot to be in' that acknowledges the awkwardness and emotional difficulty right away",
      "Uses first-person language naturally with 'If I were you, I'd start...' creating personal connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts like 'I'm not really looking to make new friends right now' giving teens exact words they can use in the moment",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The third paragraph is quite dense and long; breaking it into two paragraphs would improve mobile readability while maintaining the prose format",
      "Could strengthen first-person emotional connection with an explicit 'I get why that feels stressful' before transitioning to the practical advice section",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Break the third paragraph after 'keep it consistent.' to improve readability while maintaining the prose format",
      "Add one explicit first-person validation phrase like 'I totally get why that feels stressful' or 'I've been there' before diving into the practical advice to strengthen emotional connection",
      "Consider varying the emoji choice or adding a second one later in the response to match the more serious tone when discussing potential harassment"
