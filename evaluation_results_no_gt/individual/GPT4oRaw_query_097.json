      "Provides a specific, actionable script the teen can use word-for-word ('Hey, I really appreciate you asking...') which makes the advice immediately usable",
      "Opens with warm validation ('Oh, I hear you! That can be such a tricky situation') and maintains a supportive tone throughout",
      "Uses natural prose paragraphs without resorting to bullet points or over-formatting, reading like a text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks a follow-up question at the end, missing the opportunity to continue the conversation and check in about their feelings or plans",
      "Uses impersonal instructional language ('The key is to be kind', 'It’s totally okay to set boundaries') rather than first-person perspective ('I think the key is...', 'I’d say it’s okay...')",
      "Could deepen emotional validation by acknowledging the specific awkwardness or guilt of rejecting someone rather than just calling it 'tricky'"

      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end like 'Do you think you'll see them soon?' or 'How are you feeling about having that conversation?' to keep the dialogue open",
      "Replace impersonal phrases like 'The key is...' with first-person language like 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I’d probably say something like...' to sound more like a supportive friend sharing personal perspective",
      "Deepen the emotional validation by acknowledging the specific feelings involved, such as 'That guilty pit-in-your-stomach feeling is the worst' before moving to solutions"
