    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such an awkward spot to be in') that immediately normalizes the teen's feelings",
      "Provides excellent specific scripts for different scenarios (Slow Fade, Gentle Boundary, Direct Route) that teens can actually use word-for-word",
      "Ends with a natural, context-specific follow-up question about how the person is approaching them (texts, showing up places, etc.)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers ('**The Slow Fade**', '**Gentle Boundary**') makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it' to create personal connection; feels instructional rather than empathetic",
      "Advice-to-validation ratio is too heavy on solutions (approximately 70% advice formatting vs. 30% supportive prose)"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, tiered strategies with exact phrasing teens can use",

      "notes": "Response contains 4 bold headers and 7 bullet points, with only the opening paragraph, closing sentence, and final question in prose format. Reads as highly structured self-help content rather than conversational texting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as natural prose paragraphs using first-person perspective (e.g., 'I'd probably start with the slow fade approach...' instead of bullet lists)",
      "Add first-person sharing language like 'I think' or 'In my experience' to sound less like an instruction manual and more like a supportive friend",
      "Consider softening the structure by removing bold headers and integrating the advice into flowing sentences that validate while advising"
