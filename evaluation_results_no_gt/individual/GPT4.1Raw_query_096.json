    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text message",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I'm really sorry','I can listen') creating personal connection",
      "Good balance between emotional validation (first paragraph) and practical advice (second paragraph)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing a specific follow-up question at the end - 'Let me know what you need' is an invitation but not an engaging question",
      "Could open with slightly more casual, immediate validation ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling') rather than 'I'm really sorry you're feeling that way'",
      "Lacks emoji entirely - while not required, a single 💙 or 😔 could enhance warmth for this emotional topic"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up engagement - fails to end with a specific question that would invite the teen to share more details about their situation",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a specific, engaging question at the end like 'What's usually happening right before you feel most left out?' or 'Do you think your friends realize you're feeling this way?'",
      "Consider opening with slightly more casual empathy like 'Ugh, that's such a rough feeling' before the validation to match teen conversational style",
      "Optional: Add one gentle emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to set a warm, supportive tone for this emotionally vulnerable topic"
