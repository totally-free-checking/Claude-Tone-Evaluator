    "strengths": [
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice with concrete scripts (e.g., 'I feel kinda awkward around your parents—did I do something...') and realistic teen strategies",
      "Ends with an excellent, specific follow-up question that asks for situational details to personalize future advice",
      "Maintains a non-judgmental tone throughout and acknowledges the awkwardness of being judged in someone else's home"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy over-structuring with 6 numbered headers and multiple bullet point lists makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout the advice sections (no 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get that') creating distance rather than connection",
      "Validation is limited to the opening sentence before immediately jumping into 6 sections of practical solutions without emotional check-ins"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific phrases to use and concrete behavioral changes are perfectly tailored to teen agency and social situations",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response uses headers (### 1), numbered lists, and bullet points extensively, creating a clinical, self-help article format rather than conversational texting",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 6 numbered sections with headers (### 1, ### 2, etc.) and extensive bullet points under each. The only prose is the opening sentence and closing question. Reads as highly structured content rather than natural conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd probably start by...' instead of numbered headers",
      "Add 1-2 more sentences of emotional validation after the opening before diving into solutions, and check in emotionally midway through",
      "Remove all headers and bullet points, integrating the advice naturally into 2-3 conversational paragraphs that flow like a friend texting advice"
