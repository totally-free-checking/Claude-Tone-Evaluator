      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - closes with a statement rather than inviting continued conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely (no 'I think', 'I'd suggest', or 'I get it') making it feel impersonal despite casual vocabulary",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the friendly tone, or keep it at zero if maintaining a more serious tone for the guilt aspect"
