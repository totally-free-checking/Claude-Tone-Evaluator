      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ughhh that's such an awful oh no moment') that perfectly captures the panic of double-booking",
      "Provides specific, actionable text scripts for both scenarios (coach and friend) that a teen could literally copy and send",
      "Uses natural prose throughout with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could use more explicit first-person connection statements from the bot's perspective (like 'I get how stressful that is') rather than only using first-person within the example texts the teen would send",
      "Slightly weighted toward practical advice over emotional support, though it does start with validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - maintains perfect conversational flow across four paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, creating an authentic texting-like experience",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Limited first-person language from the bot itself - relies heavily on 'you' statements and impersonal observations ('usually goes over better') rather than 'I' statements that would create stronger personal connection",

      "Add one explicit first-person validation statement like 'I get that sinking feeling when you realize you messed up the schedule' to strengthen personal connection",
      "Consider adding slightly more emotional validation before diving into the specific text scripts to enhance the support-to-solutions ratio"
