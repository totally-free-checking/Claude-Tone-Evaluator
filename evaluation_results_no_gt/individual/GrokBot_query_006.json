    "strengths": [
      "Immediate validation with relatable physical description ('it's like your stomach's in knots') that captures the specific anxiety of post-test panic",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'we've all had those moments') creating authentic connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice realistic for teen agency (jotting down struggle areas, asking teacher about retakes) rather than generic platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'The good news is there are usually ways to bounce back' is slightly generic and transitional before getting to the specific advice",
      "Could offer one specific phrase or script for approaching the teacher to make the advice even more actionable"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "The reassurance 'it probably isn't as bad as it feels right now' could potentially feel slightly dismissive of their current panic, though it is framed gently",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific conversation starter script for talking to the teacher (e.g., 'You could try saying...') to make the advice immediately usable",
      "The validation is strong, but could briefly name the specific feeling ('that sinking feeling when you realize you blanked on a problem') before reassuring to show deep understanding"
