    "strengths": [
      "Uses natural prose format without any bullet points or over-formatting, reading like a text message",
      "Includes a follow-up question to continue the conversation rather than ending abruptly"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person singular language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses 'us' but feels impersonal without 'I' statements",
      "Extremely brief (only 2 sentences of content) which risks feeling dismissive of the stress of double-booking",
      "Validation is generic ('That happens to the best of us') rather than specific to the situation",
      "Advice is vague - asks if they can reschedule but offers no concrete steps for how to handle the conflict"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural elements, maintaining a conversational text-like flow",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Length and depth - the response is too brief to provide meaningful emotional support or practical help, feeling more like a dismissive 'bummer' than supportive guidance",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or bold text. However, the brevity (only 3 short sentences total) makes it feel more like a quick dismissal than a substantial supportive response."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand to 2-4 paragraphs with more substantial validation - acknowledge the specific stress of realizing you've double-booked and the anxiety of letting people down",
      "Add first-person language like 'I'd be panicking too' or 'I think the best move would be...' to create a personal connection rather than generic statements",
      "Replace the binary question with something more open-ended and supportive like 'Which one feels more important to you right now, or is there a way to do both?'",
      "Include one emoji (like 😅 or 😬) early in the response to soften the tone and signal warmth",
      "Offer specific actionable advice such as 'Text your coach ASAP to explain' or 'See if you can join practice late' rather than just asking if they can reschedule"
