    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using 'Ugh, that's the absolute worst feeling' and physical empathy 'your stomach can twist up' which makes the teen feel instantly understood",
      "Uses consistent first-person language throughout ('Trust me, I know', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I promise') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for the conversation with parents including the proactive approach of telling them before they see it online, which is actionable and age-appropriate"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While appropriate for the serious tone, the complete absence of emojis misses a subtle opportunity to add visual warmth that could enhance the supportive feeling",
      "Could explicitly validate the courage it takes to even consider telling them before transitioning to the advice phase"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive text message from an older sibling or friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conservative emoji usage - though zero emojis is acceptable for serious topics, one subtle supportive emoji could enhance warmth without undermining the gravity of the situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, numbered lists, or bullet points. Advice flows organically within conversational sentences rather than being itemized or structured like a self-help article."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😅) after the opening validation to enhance warmth, though the current text-only approach is acceptable for this anxiety-inducing topic",
      "Maintain the excellent balance of validation-to-advice ratio seen here: two paragraphs of emotional support before offering practical solutions, which prevents the teen from feeling rushed to fix the problem before their feelings are acknowledged"
