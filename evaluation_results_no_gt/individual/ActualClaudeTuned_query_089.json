    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd also try', 'I totally get') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledging the overwhelming cycle",
      "Specific actionable advice (15-20 minute timer, pick smallest task) that's realistic for teens"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Balance slightly leans toward advice over validation - could use one more validating sentence before transitioning to 'The good news is'",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt; a softer bridge like 'That said' or 'For what it's worth' could help"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation style with consistent first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') that makes it feel like texting with a supportive friend rather than receiving instructions",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase before transitioning to solutions, such as 'It's so unfair how that happens' to extend the emotional support",
      "The emoji usage (😅) is well-placed and appropriate, creating that 'nervous but relatable' energy perfect for procrastination stress"
