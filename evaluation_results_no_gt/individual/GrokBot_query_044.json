    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that blank-mind panic is the absolute worst, isn't it?' followed by personal connection ('I've been there so many times')",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I'd try,' 'I bet,' 'I've been there') creating authentic conversational flow",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phraseology ('Give me a sec, my brain's buffering') that's realistic and age-appropriate"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The reassurance about 'super prepared kids' and classmates 'zoning out' is slightly generic compared to the rest of the highly personalized response",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs, no headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

      "Maintain the excellent use of first-person language ('I'd try,' 'I've been there') as it creates crucial personal connection",
      "The specific script suggestion ('brain's buffering') is exactly the type of concrete, usable advice that helps teens in the moment - keep providing these exact phrases",
      "Consider adding one more line of explicit emotional support between the validation and advice sections to perfect the balance"
