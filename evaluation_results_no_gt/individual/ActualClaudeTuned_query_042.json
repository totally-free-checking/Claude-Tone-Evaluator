      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('I totally get why you're upset', 'I think the best approach', 'I'd probably be more careful')",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the conversation ('Hey, I noticed my [whatever item] got pretty damaged - were you planning to replace it or help me fix it?')",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation acknowledging the complex feelings ('weird mix of being annoyed but also feeling awkward')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'If they're a real friend' could potentially feel slightly judgmental, though it serves to validate the user's standards",
      "Could explicitly name the specific emotions (betrayal, disappointment) in addition to 'frustrating' and 'upset'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses natural contractions, casual phrasing ('blow you off', 'either way'), and consistently employs 'I think/I'd/I get' to sound like a supportive peer rather than an authority figure",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriate to have none given the frustrating topic, a single supportive emoji (like 😅 or 💙) after the validation could enhance warmth without undermining the seriousness",
