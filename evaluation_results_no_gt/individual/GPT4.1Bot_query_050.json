    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were in your shoes, I'd probably', 'I totally get why you're dreading it') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's the actual worst' and acknowledging the exhaustion of the situation",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance visual warmth, though zero is acceptable for this more serious topic",
      "The follow-up contains two connected questions which is slightly less streamlined than a single focused question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses natural casual phrasing ('actual worst', 'super intense', 'chill'), contractions throughout, and consistently frames advice through personal perspective ('I'd probably', 'If I were in your shoes') making it feel like a supportive friend rather than a bot",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while zero emojis is appropriate for the serious nature of the topic, a single well-placed supportive emoji could have added an extra layer of warmth to balance the 'hate' situation without undermining the gravity",

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or bold formatting (except italic emphasis on 'too'). Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining conversational flow throughout."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the end of the first paragraph to enhance warmth without undermining the seriousness",
      "The follow-up question could be streamlined to a single question like 'Do you have any idea why they might be acting this way?' rather than the compound question, though the current version is still conversational"
