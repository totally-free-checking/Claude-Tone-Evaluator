    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('Totally get that—it’s super common') that normalizes the nervousness",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (testing waters first, bringing backup, writing bullet points on phone)",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging question specific to the situation ('What’s making you most nervous about it?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Contains a substantial bulleted list with bold headers ('**Some things that might make it easier:**') that reads like a self-help article rather than conversational texting",
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' - uses implied first person ('Totally get that') but misses opportunities for personal connection",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji to enhance the supportive tone given the anxiety-inducing topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic strategies like writing notes on a phone or bringing a friend for moral support",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose vs bullet formatting - the four-item bulleted list with bold headers breaks the conversational flow significantly",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "Approximately 60%",
      "notes": "Response contains a prominent bulleted section with bold headers ('**Some things that might make it easier:**') containing four detailed bullet points, which creates a structured, listicle-like format inconsistent with natural texting prose"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bulleted advice section into 1-2 flowing paragraphs using natural transitions like 'You could try testing the waters first...' or 'Another thing that helps is...'",
      "Add explicit first-person language such as 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd say start with...' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😊 or 💙) early in the response to reinforce warmth, though the absence is acceptable"
