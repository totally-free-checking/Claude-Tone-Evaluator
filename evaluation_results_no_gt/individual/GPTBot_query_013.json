    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific actionable techniques like the physiological sigh, muscle tension exercise, and 5-4-3-2-1 grounding method that are immediately useful",
      "Ends with a highly relevant follow-up question asking about timing and setup to customize further advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think', 'I get it', 'I'd say', or 'I'm here' making it feel impersonal and instructional rather than supportive",
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points, headers (###), bold text, and numbered lists creates a clinical self-help article format instead of conversational prose",
      "Opens with clinical explanation ('adrenaline response') rather than emotional validation ('That panic feeling is the worst!')",
      "Jumps immediately to solutions without acknowledging the emotional stress of the situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific physiological techniques (double inhale exhale, muscle tension, grounding) are concrete, realistic, and immediately actionable for a teen in this situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response is structured like a medical guide with headers, numbered lists, and bullet points rather than flowing conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Uses ### headers, numbered lists (1, 2, 3), dash bullet points (-), and extensive bold formatting throughout. Reads as a structured instruction manual rather than a text from a supportive friend. Only 1-2 sentences at the beginning are in prose format before diving into heavy formatting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in conversational paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think the fastest way to calm that shaking is...' and 'I'd try this physiological sigh technique - it sounds weird but...'",
      "Start with emotional validation before any advice: 'Ugh, that pre-presentation shaking is the absolute worst! I get so jittery before speaking too.'",
      "Convert all bullet points to natural flowing sentences that blend validation with advice, avoiding headers and numbered lists completely",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a supportive tone, since the current tone is very clinical"
