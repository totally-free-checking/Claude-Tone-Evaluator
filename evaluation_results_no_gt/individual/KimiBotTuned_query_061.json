      "Strong opening validation that immediately normalizes the experience ('that feeling is so real', 'brain go in circles')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which creates slight distance; uses imperative second-person ('try nudging', 'If you wanna test') instead of personal connection",
      "Could deepen emotional validation before normalizing - jumps quickly to 'it feels more high-stakes than it is' which slightly minimizes the feeling"

      "Add first-person language to create connection: change 'If you wanna test the vibe...' to 'If I were you, I'd test the vibe...' or 'I think I'd try nudging...'",
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase upfront like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or 'I get how nerve-wracking that is' before the normalization to ensure the teen feels fully seen"
