    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, visceral validation ('Ugh, that really sucks') and physical description of the emotional weight ('make your chest feel heavy', 'gut-wrenching feeling')",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I get how painful it is', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'we've all been there') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic conversation script ('Hey, I've been feeling a bit like a safety net lately...') rather than vague advice"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) to enhance emotional connection given the painful topic",
