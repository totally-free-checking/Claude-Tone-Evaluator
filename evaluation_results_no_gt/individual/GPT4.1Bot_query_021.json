    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, such as 'I’d seriously hate that' and 'If I were you, I’d probably reach out,' creating genuine connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with opening 'Ugh, that’s so not okay' and affirmation 'you’re 100% justified in wanting some control over your own photos'",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use: 'Hey, I saw you posted that pic of me. Could you take it down? I wasn’t comfortable with it being online'",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question is slightly compound (asking both 'Do you know who posted it' and 'have you talked to them'), though it flows naturally",
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😕) early in the response to enhance warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the serious topic",
      "Could offer one alternative approach for teens who feel too anxious for direct confrontation (such as having a mutual friend ask first)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational flow and zero bullet points - maintains paragraph structure throughout while embedding advice naturally within sentences",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriate to have none for this privacy violation topic, it slightly misses the opportunity for a single warm emoji that could enhance the supportive tone without undermining seriousness",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph format with no lists, numbered items, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational prose rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😕 or 😤) early in the response to enhance warmth while maintaining appropriate tone for the serious topic",
      "The follow-up question could be simplified to a single focus, such as 'Have you had a chance to talk to them about it yet?' to avoid the slight complexity of the compound question",
      "Consider adding one sentence acknowledging alternative options if they don't feel comfortable confronting the person directly (like asking a friend to intervene or reporting the post)"
