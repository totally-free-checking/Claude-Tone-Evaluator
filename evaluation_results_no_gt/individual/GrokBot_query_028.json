    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language that creates connection ('I've totally been there', 'I'd say just reach out')",
      "Natural prose flow without any bullet points or over-formatting - reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Provides specific, realistic script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I didn't mean for that to sound rude – sorry if it did!')",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sinking feeling' and acknowledging 'it sucks'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one might enhance warmth (like 😅 or 😬 after 'sinking feeling'), though the prose is warm enough without it",
      "The reassurance that 'most slip-ups aren't as big a deal' could potentially minimize the teen's anxiety if not for the strong validation preceding it"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and prose formatting - uses contractions, casual language ('it sucks', 'huge thing'), and first-person perspective naturally without any corporate or clinical language",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while 0 emojis is acceptable, a single well-placed emoji could have enhanced the warm, casual tone slightly",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after the first sentence to visually reinforce the 'sinking feeling' emotion",
      "The follow-up question is engaging and specific, though it technically contains two questions ('who was it to and what did you say?'), it works naturally as a conversational flow"
