      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting, reading like a text from a friend",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') when offering the perspective about misunderstandings, using impersonal 'Sometimes people act...' instead",

      "Deepen the validation by specifically naming how painful and isolating it feels to feel hated by a teacher before moving to the 'maybe it's not personal' perspective"
