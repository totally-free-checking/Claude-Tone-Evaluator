      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get,' 'If I were you, I'd try,' 'We've all been there') creating genuine personal connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The perspective-shifting advice ('most people probably aren't dwelling on it') could be softened with one additional validating phrase before the reality check",

      "Consider expanding the 'naming the feeling' advice with a concrete example like 'Okay, that was awkward but it's over' to make the technique clearer"
