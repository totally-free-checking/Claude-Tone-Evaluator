      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use (e.g., 'I'm open to talking about it, but I don't want this to turn into deciding my whole future right now')",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging question that shows interest in the details of their situation ('are they pushing a specific school, worried about costs, or comparing you to someone?')",
      "Uses casual, age-appropriate language like 'yeah,' 'kind of,' and 'like...' which avoids sounding formal or clinical"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd suggest,' 'I get it') - uses only second-person instructional language ('You can say,' 'A good move is,' 'If you want') which feels impersonal",
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points, numbered lists, and bold headers makes it read like a self-help article or instruction manual rather than a conversational text",
      "Jumps immediately to solutions after only one brief validating sentence - insufficient emotional support before the problem-solving"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic scripts and specific time-bound strategies (20-minute limit) that a 10th grader can actually implement",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the response is heavily structured with numbered lists, bold headers, and bullet points rather than flowing conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 9,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response starts with one prose sentence then immediately shifts to bullet points for dialogue suggestions, followed by a numbered list (1-3) with bold headers and sub-bullets. Reads as a structured guide rather than a natural conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd probably start by saying something like...' or 'I think you could try asking them...' instead of bullet points and headers",
      "Add more emotional validation upfront before offering solutions - expand on 'that can feel really early' with something like 'Ugh, that pressure when you're just trying to get through sophomore year is so real'",
      "Remove the numbered '1) 2) 3)' structure and bold headers entirely; integrate those suggestions into natural sentences that flow together as a cohesive thought"
