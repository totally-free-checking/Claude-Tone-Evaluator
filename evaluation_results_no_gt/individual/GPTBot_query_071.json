    "strengths": [
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice including exact email phrasing ('I'm worried I'm not on track. Can we talk about what I can still do to pass...') and concrete time blocks (25 minutes)",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging follow-up question that invites the teen to share details about their specific situation rather than a generic 'How are you?'",
      "Acknowledges the emotional weight immediately with 'That sounds really heavy to carry'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and numbered lists (8 total) rather than natural prose paragraphs, making it read like a self-help article instead of a text from a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person supportive language like 'I get it,' 'I'd say,' or 'I'm here for you' - feels impersonal and instructional rather than supportive",
      "Rushes from brief validation immediately into problem-solving mode without enough emotional support (only 1 sentence of validation vs. 5 detailed action items)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the suggestions are realistic, specific to academic contexts, and include concrete scripts and timeframes that a teen could actually use immediately",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting and structure - uses 8 separate bullet points/numbered items with bold headers, creating a checklist format that violates the conversational prose requirement",

      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response begins with 3 numbered questions, then shifts to 5 bold-formatted action items with headers. Only 2-3 sentences are in true paragraph form. Reads as structured advice rather than conversational support."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the 5 action items into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs that flow conversationally, using transitions like 'I'd probably start by...' or 'Maybe you could try...' instead of bold headers",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout, such as 'I get how scary that feels when you're staring at a bad grade' or 'I'm here to help you figure this out' to create connection",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) after the opening validation to soften the tone before moving to practical steps",
      "Spend more time validating the fear before jumping to solutions - maybe 2-3 sentences acknowledging how overwhelming school pressure feels before asking for details"
