    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'Ugh, that really sucks' and 'I've totally been there' that creates instant connection",
      "Excellent use of first-person perspective throughout ('I'd say', 'I've been there') making it feel like advice from a supportive friend rather than an impersonal guide",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen agency including exact phrases to use ('Hey, mind if I join?') and realistic in-the-moment coping strategies"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'it's not a big deal in the long run' could potentially minimize the immediate emotional discomfort, even though intended to be reassuring",
      "Slightly quick transition from validation to reassurance without fully sitting with the uncomfortable feelings first"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive text message from an older sibling or friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The reassurance that the situation is 'not a big deal' could feel slightly dismissive of the immediate social anxiety, though the overall tone remains supportive",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider softening the 'not a big deal' language to something like 'it feels huge right now, but most people won't remember it tomorrow' to validate the present moment while offering perspective",
      "The response is exemplary overall; maintain this balance of immediate validation, first-person connection, and specific actionable advice for future responses"
