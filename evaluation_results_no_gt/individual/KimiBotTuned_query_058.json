    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language ('Ugh, yeah...', 'That nervous, shaky feeling before you walk in is so real') that normalizes the fear",
      "Specific, actionable script suggestions including exact phrases to say ('I'm kind of nervous and I don't really know how to say this') and a crucial confidentiality question",
      "Natural conversational flow using casual teen-appropriate language ('act chill about it', 'super intimidating') without sounding forced"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person advisory language (e.g., 'I'd suggest', 'I think') in the advice section, making it slightly less personal than ideal",
      "The emoji 😅, while appropriate for nervousness, might slightly undercut the seriousness for some teens, though it generally enhances the warm tone"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text message from a friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of explicit first-person 'I' statements in the advice portion (uses 'You can' instead of 'I'd suggest you try'), making the advice feel slightly less personally connected",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add explicit first-person framing to the advice section (e.g., 'I'd suggest starting with...' or 'What I'd do is...') to strengthen the personal connection",
      "Consider varying the opening validation slightly to include 'I'm here' or 'I get it' to reinforce the supportive relationship"
