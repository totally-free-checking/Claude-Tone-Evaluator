    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation using casual language ('That really sucks') and acknowledges the emotional impact of losing freedom",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout ('I'll help you', 'I can help you draft') creating a personal connection",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice with exact scripts the teen can use ('I get why you're upset', 'Can we do X instead')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured formatting with numbered lists (2 items) and bullet points (4 items) breaks conversational flow",
      "Asks three questions at once (two numbered, one at the end) which can feel overwhelming rather than naturally engaging",
      "Could use slightly more empathetic warmth upfront before moving to the problem-solving phase"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic scripts and negotiation strategies specifically tailored for teen-parent conversations about grounding",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - uses multiple structured lists instead of flowing conversational paragraphs, reading more like an instruction manual than a supportive text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "45%",
      "notes": "Response contains 2 numbered questions (1, 2) and 4 dash-prefixed bullet points with advice scripts. The advice section is entirely bulleted rather than woven into natural prose paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet-pointed advice into 1-2 flowing paragraphs that naturally incorporate the suggestions ('I'd start by acknowledging their perspective, then maybe ask something like...')",
      "Combine the multiple questions into one natural follow-up question or spread them throughout the conversation rather than listing them",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 😕 or 💙) after the opening validation to enhance the supportive tone without overdoing it"
