    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'm really sorry', 'I totally get', 'If I were you, I'd probably try') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate validation in opening ('Ugh, I'm really sorry', 'heavy weight to carry') before moving to solutions",
      "Natural conversational language using 'honestly', 'totally', 'literally' without sounding forced",
      "Specific, realistic advice including exact phrasing to use with parents and concrete self-care actions (step outside, listen to music)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance visual warmth, though the absence doesn't significantly hurt",
      "The advice section could briefly mention when/where to have the conversation with parents (e.g., 'when they're relaxed') for additional specificity"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language usage—the response consistently uses 'I' statements ('I totally get', 'If I were you, I'd') and natural contractions that make it feel like a real person rather than an AI or article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage—while zero emojis is acceptable for this serious topic, adding one supportive emoji could have enhanced the warmth slightly without undermining the gravity of the situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent pure prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs rather than being listed out. Uses italics for emphasis (*everything*) which is appropriate and conversational."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) after the opening validation to match the '0-1 max' guideline for enhanced warmth",
      "The suggested script for talking to parents is great—consider adding a brief note about timing (e.g., bringing it up when they're not busy) to make the advice even more actionable",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific—maintain this level of personalization in future responses"
