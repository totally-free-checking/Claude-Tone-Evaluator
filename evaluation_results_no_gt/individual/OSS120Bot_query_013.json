    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using 'I hear you' and describes the situation as a 'gut-punch,' creating instant empathy and connection",
      "Maintains pure prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a natural text conversation between friends",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice with exact breathing counts (inhale for three, hold for two) and concrete physical techniques (gripping podium edges)",
      "Uses exactly one well-placed emoji (😅) early in the response that enhances warmth without overwhelming the text"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd suggest,' 'What works for me') in the advice section, relying on imperative statements ('If you can, take...', 'Also, try...') that feel slightly impersonal despite the warm opening",
      "Could strengthen the personal connection with an explicit 'I've been there' or 'I get it' statement to complement the 'you're not alone' validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and perfect emoji placement that reads like a supportive text message",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective in the practical advice section, using imperative commands rather than personal suggestions like 'I'd recommend' or 'I think'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to the practical suggestions, such as changing 'If you can, take a quick power breath' to 'I'd suggest taking a quick power breath' or 'What helps me is...' to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "Consider including one explicit 'I' statement in the validation section, such as 'I know how overwhelming that feels' to better balance the impersonal tone of the advice paragraph"
