    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with two flowing paragraphs",
      "Strong specific advice including exact scripts like 'I need a second to gather my thoughts' that a teen can actually use in the moment",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh no, that can be such an awkward moment!' and 'it happens to everyone') that normalizes the experience"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - the response closes with a statement about learning rather than inviting the teen to share more",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely (no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I'm here') which makes it feel more like general advice than a personal conversation from a supportive friend",
      "Uses 'honestly' but could benefit from more casual connectors like 'Ugh' or 'That's rough' to increase relatability"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - perfectly conversational paragraph flow",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of follow-up question to continue the conversation - ends abruptly without engaging the user to share more",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with two natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a follow-up question at the end like 'Has this happened to you recently?' or 'How did you handle it in the moment?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout, such as 'I think the best thing you can do is...' or 'I get how nerve-wracking that feels' to establish a personal connection",
      "Consider adding a closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk through it more' to reinforce the supportive friend persona"
