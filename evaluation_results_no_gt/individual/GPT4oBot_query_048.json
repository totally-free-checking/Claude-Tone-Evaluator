    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry you're dealing with that' and 'I get why that would totally suck' creates instant connection",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for calling out the behavior: 'Hey, I know you don't mean it, but being compared to my sibling makes me feel like I'm not enough'",
      "Excellent balance between emotional validation (first two paragraphs) and practical advice (third paragraph)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section lacks first-person framing like 'I think you could try' or 'I'd suggest,' using second-person 'you could try' instead which is slightly less personal than the opening",
      "While the two follow-up questions are contextually related, asking two questions back-to-back slightly dilutes the conversational feel"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - maintains perfect conversational flow throughout without any over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') in the advice section compared to the strong first-person validation in the opening",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Italics are used sparingly for emphasis (*own* person, *way* more often) which enhances rather than disrupts the conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to the advice section such as 'I'd probably try saying...' or 'I think gently calling it out could work...' to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "Consider using a single follow-up question like 'Who's usually making these comparisons?' rather than two consecutive questions to keep the conversation feeling more organic"
