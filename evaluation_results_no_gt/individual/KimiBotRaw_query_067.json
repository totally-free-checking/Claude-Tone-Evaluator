    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, yeah that's so annoying!') that mirrors the teen's frustration",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable conversation scripts the teen can actually use with parents ('I'm happy to talk about this, but can we agree I don't need to decide my major...')",
      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the details"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet point lists and bold headers ('Here’s the thing:', 'For the actual conversation:') instead of flowing prose",
      "Lacks first-person narrator voice ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - uses observational distance instead",
      "No emoji used where one might enhance warmth (though tone remains warm through text)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, specific phrases for the teen to use with parents rather than vague suggestions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting structure - uses two distinct bullet lists with bold headers, reading more like an article than a text conversation",

      "bullet_count": 2,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response contains two separate bullet lists (one for college prep priorities, one for conversation scripts) with bold headers, significantly breaking up the prose flow"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural flowing sentences ('I'd say just focus on keeping grades decent, maybe taking a practice test if you're bored, and exploring hobbies you actually like')",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout ('I think your parents are just anxious...', 'I'd suggest trying...') to create more personal connection",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early (like 😅 or 😤) to match the 'ugh' sentiment, though this is optional"
