      "Opens with strong validation and reframing ('The fact that you're worried about it actually shows you care about how the other person feels, which already puts you ahead of the game')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bullet points with bold headers ('**If it's still bugging you...**', '**If you're not sure...**', '**If it's someone close...**') makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal constructions like 'A simple... works wonders' and 'You could even joke' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think'",
