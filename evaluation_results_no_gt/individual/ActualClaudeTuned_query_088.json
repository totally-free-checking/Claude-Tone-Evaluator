    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'that's such a horrible feeling' that acknowledge the frustration of being ignored",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe consider', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen could use when approaching the teacher"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly strengthen validation by explicitly acknowledging the emotional toll if the teen was personally targeted by the comment versus witnessing it",
      "The follow-up question, while good, combines two questions which could potentially feel slightly less focused than a single open-ended question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with zero bullet points and authentic use of 'I think' and 'I'd say'",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight missed opportunity to validate the courage required to speak up to authority figures, though this is minor given the overall strength",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider explicitly validating how exhausting or scary it can feel to be the one who has to educate adults about handling these situations",
      "Could distinguish slightly between whether the teen was the target of the comment or a witness, as the emotional weight differs, though the current approach works for both"
