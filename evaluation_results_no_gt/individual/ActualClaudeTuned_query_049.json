    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout with natural usage of 'I get it,' 'I think,' and 'I'd say' creating authentic connection",

      "Highly specific and engaging follow-up question about the type of smile that invites deeper sharing"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could offer one more specific conversation starter beyond 'say hi' to make the advice even more actionable",
      "The transition to 'you're probably reading way more into it' comes slightly quickly - could linger on validating the excitement a moment longer before the gentle reality check"

      "While the reality check is gentle and needed, you could add one more sentence validating how exciting/nerve-wracking that moment feels before pivoting to perspective"
