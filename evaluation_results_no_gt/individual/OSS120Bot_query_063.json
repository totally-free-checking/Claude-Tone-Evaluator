    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'I'm so sorry' and 'I've totally been there' that normalizes the experience",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally from validation to advice to follow-up like a real conversation",
      "Specific, actionable scripts like 'Oops, sorry, wrong class!' that give the teen exact words to use"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section could use more explicit first-person framing (e.g., 'I'd suggest' or 'I think') to strengthen the personal connection",
      "The follow-up question focuses on the logistical outcome (getting to class) rather than checking in on their emotional state after the embarrassment"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with no bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout all four paragraphs",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to the advice section (e.g., 'I'd probably just slip out with a quick...') to make it feel more like personal sharing than instructions",
      "Consider asking about their feelings in the follow-up (e.g., 'How are you feeling about it now?') in addition to whether they got to class"
