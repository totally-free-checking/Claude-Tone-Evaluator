    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with descriptive empathy ('like you're watching a movie of other people having fun while you're standing right there in the room with them')",
      "Natural use of first-person language ('I know it sounds basic') and casual teen-appropriate tone ('brain being a jerk','vibing')",
      "Specific, actionable advice with concrete examples of exact phrases to use ('How's that project going?','Wait, what did you mean earlier about ___?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a structured bullet list with bold headers instead of pure prose paragraphs, breaking the conversational flow",
      "The engaging question about whether this is an off day vs. the norm is buried in the middle rather than placed at the end",
      "Over-formatting with bold text and colons creates a self-help article aesthetic rather than a texting conversation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - consistently validates the teen's feelings with empathetic language from the opening 'Ugh' to the closing reassurance that they're not being dramatic",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - shifts abruptly from conversational paragraphs into a formatted 3-item list with bold headers, violating the prose-only ideal",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response begins with two strong prose paragraphs but shifts into 'A few things that might help in the moment:' followed by a structured list with bold headers (e.g., '**Try the \"one real conversation\" trick**:'). This formatting is too structured and checklist-like compared to the ideal conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet point section into natural prose paragraphs, integrating the three suggestions ('one real conversation' trick, checking hunger/tiredness, stepping out) into the conversational flow rather than listing them with bold headers",
      "Move the question 'are these friends who usually make you feel seen...?' to the very end of the response to encourage continued conversation and meet the 'end with a question' requirement",
      "Remove all bold text and colons to maintain the casual, texting-like aesthetic throughout"
