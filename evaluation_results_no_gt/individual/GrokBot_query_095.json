    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you', 'I'd try', 'I think') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, those fighting jokes aren't landing with me anymore – can we drop it?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could acknowledge the potential safety concern slightly more explicitly since fighting jokes can feel threatening/intimidating",
      "The advice section is proportionally longer than the validation section, though validation does come first"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person perspective ('If I were you', 'I think', 'I'd try')",

      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or bullet points. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence acknowledging that fighting jokes can feel scary or threatening, not just frustrating",
      "The balance is good but could shift slightly more toward validation before moving to the 'good news is' transition to advice"
