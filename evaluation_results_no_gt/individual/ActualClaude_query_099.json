    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'that really sucks' and 'totally understandable that you feel violated' that acknowledge the betrayal and privacy invasion",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - advice flows conversationally through paragraphs like 'maybe you could find a more secure spot' rather than being listed",
      "Validates both possible paths forward (talking to parent vs. not being ready) with 'that's completely valid too,' showing non-judgmental support"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could use more explicit first-person framing for advice (e.g., 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd suggest...') rather than the more impersonal 'maybe you could'",
      "While both questions are good, having two questions (one mid-text, one at end) slightly dilutes the focus compared to one strong closing question",
      "Could offer specific script language for talking to the parent if they choose that route, rather than just suggesting the conversation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with excellent emotional validation that immediately acknowledges the violation of trust without jumping straight to solutions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language usage - while it uses 'I'm sorry' and 'I hope,' it lacks 'I think' or 'I'd say' framing that would make the advice feel more like personal suggestions from a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose structure with no bullet points, lists, or excessive formatting. Advice is seamlessly woven into conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to advice statements (e.g., change 'maybe you could find' to 'I think you could try finding' or 'I'd suggest looking for') to increase the personal, friend-like connection",
      "Consider consolidating the two questions into one specific closing question, or ensure the mid-text question feels more like a natural check-in rather than a prompt",
      "Offer 1-2 specific phrases the teen could use when talking to their parent (e.g., 'I felt really violated when you read my diary because...') to make the advice more actionable"
