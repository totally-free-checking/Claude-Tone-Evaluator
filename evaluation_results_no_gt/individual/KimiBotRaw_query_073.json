    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that's so exhausting!') that immediately acknowledges the draining nature of competitive friends",
      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use like 'Hey, I'm not trying to compete with you—I'm just sharing'",
      "Ends with engaging, specific follow-up questions about whether this is new behavior"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses heavy structural formatting with bold headers ('**Don't play the game.**', '**Call it out gently.**') that reads like a self-help article rather than conversational texting",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - never uses 'I think', 'I'd suggest', or 'I get it' which makes it feel impersonal despite casual tone",
      "Transitions to advice with 'A few ways to handle it:' which signals a list format rather than flowing naturally into suggestions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - consistently acknowledges feelings with phrases like 'totally drains the fun' and 'you deserve friends who celebrate your wins'",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - relies on four bold headers that segment advice into a list format rather than conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses bold headers (**Don't play the game**, **Call it out gently**, etc.) that function as bullet points, breaking conversational flow. The advice sections are essentially formatted as a list despite containing prose sentences."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as flowing paragraphs without bold headers - instead of '**Don't play the game.** When they try...', use 'I'd probably just not play the game. When they try to one-up you...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: change 'Some people are wired that way' to 'I think some people are just wired that way' and 'you could try' to 'I'd suggest trying'",
      "Remove the transitional phrase 'A few ways to handle it:' and instead flow naturally from validation to advice with something like 'Honestly, I'd probably try a few different approaches...'"
