    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'That sounds really frustrating and hurtful' and acknowledging the fear of not being valued",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice like 'try reaching out to them sometime when you're the one who could use support' rather than vague platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal constructions like 'It might be worth' and 'Sometimes it helps' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you should', making it feel like an advice column rather than a friend",
      "Scatters multiple questions throughout the response (three total) rather than focusing on one engaging follow-up at the end, which disrupts conversational flow",
      "Uses slightly formal vocabulary like 'reciprocal' which feels less casual/teen-appropriate"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - maintains conversational paragraph structure throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') makes the response feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend texting",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Response flows naturally in paragraph form as intended."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: change 'It might be worth having an honest conversation' to 'I'd suggest having an honest conversation' and 'Sometimes it helps' to 'I find it helps'",
      "Consolidate questions to the end of the response only - remove the middle question 'Have you noticed this pattern...' and keep just the final engaging question about how long they've felt this way",
      "Consider adding one gentle emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to enhance warmth, or keep none for this serious topic but ensure the language itself feels warmer and more personal"
