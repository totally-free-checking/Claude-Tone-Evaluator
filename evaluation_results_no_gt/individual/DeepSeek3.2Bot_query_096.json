      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with specific language like 'hollow, lonely feeling' and 'invisible or disconnected' that precisely names the teen's experience",
      "Strong use of first-person conditional language throughout ('If I were you,' 'I might try,' 'I get why') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice section is slightly brief - could benefit from one additional strategy such as suggesting a one-on-one check-in with a specific friend or acknowledging when to evaluate if the friendship is healthy",
      "Could slightly expand on the 'it's more common than you think' validation to explicitly reassure them they're not alone before moving to solutions"

      "Consider adding one additional practical suggestion, such as 'You could also try checking in with one friend individually later to reconnect,' to give more options without overwhelming",
      "The validation is strong but could explicitly include 'You're not alone in this' or 'We've all been there' to reinforce the normalization before transitioning to advice"
