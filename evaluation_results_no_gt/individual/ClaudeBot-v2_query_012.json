    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try,' 'I'm so sorry,' 'I get it' vibe) that creates genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with relatable metaphors ('hits like a punch in the stomach,' 'overthinking machine') that normalize the teen's experience",
      "Specific actionable advice with concrete scripts ('hey, how's your day going?') rather than vague suggestions"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice section focuses heavily on one specific strategy (conversation starter) and could offer one additional alternative approach for variety",
      "While the emoji is well-placed, the 😅 might slightly undercut the seriousness of 'punch in the stomach' for some readers, though it works for the awkward/cringe aspect"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with zero bullet points and authentic first-person perspective ('If I were you') that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one brief alternative strategy (like 'or give yourself 24 hours before deciding it means anything') to round out the practical advice section",
      "The current emoji usage is good, but for future serious topics, ensure the emoji choice matches the emotional weight of the validation (😅 works here for the awkwardness, but 💙 or 😊 might work for sadder moments)"
