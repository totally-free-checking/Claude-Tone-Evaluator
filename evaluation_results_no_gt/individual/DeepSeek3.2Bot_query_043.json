    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with specific physical description ('weird, heavy knot in your stomach') that makes the teen feel truly understood",
      "Provides concrete, realistic script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I feel like maybe something's been a little off lately—is everything okay between us?') with explanation of why it works",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question 'How long have you been getting that feeling from them?' is slightly more clinical than the rest of the warm tone; something like 'Has this been bugging you for a while?' might feel more conversational",
      "Could acknowledge the possibility that the friend actually is lying (not just that things feel 'off') while still maintaining the non-confrontational approach—currently sidesteps the 'lying' aspect slightly"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—maintains perfect conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question is slightly less warm/natural compared to the rest of the response, feeling a bit more like data-gathering than friendly curiosity",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with no formatting gimmicks, bullet lists, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider acknowledging the 'lying' possibility directly while keeping it gentle—e.g., 'Whether they're lying or just going through something...' so the teen feels seen in their specific worry",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more emotionally resonant, like 'What's your gut telling you about why they might be pulling away?' instead of focusing on duration"
