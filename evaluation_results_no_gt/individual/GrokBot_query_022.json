      "Excellent use of first-person language creates genuine connection and warmth (e.g., 'I've been there myself', 'I think the best way to handle it', 'I'd pull them aside')",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts for difficult conversations that teens can actually use (e.g., 'Hey, that joke kinda hurt my feelings – can we skip those?')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji 😔, while conveying empathy, may be slightly heavy/sad for the opening; a lighter option like 😕 might better match the 'confused' feeling mentioned in the text",

      "Continue using first-person language like 'I think' and 'I'd' to maintain the warm, personal connection; this is a key differentiator from impersonal AI responses",
      "Consider using a slightly lighter emoji (like 😕 or 😬) or no emoji for this specific scenario, as 😔 might feel slightly too heavy for the 'confused' emotion described, though it works well for showing empathy"
