      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd gently nudge,' 'I'm so sorry,' 'I think') that creates genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts for what to say ('I'm really glad you told me. Do you wanna talk about what’s been going on?') rather than vague suggestions",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points—advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The third paragraph containing safety information is quite dense and long, which could feel overwhelming despite being necessary content",
      "While the emoji validates the user's awkwardness, 😅 might feel slightly light for the serious context of a struggling friend (though usage is restrained at just one)"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with embedded specific advice—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured guide",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two separate paragraphs—one for general listening advice and one for safety/self-harm protocols—to improve readability while maintaining the prose format",
      "For serious topics like friends struggling with mental health, consider using 😔 or 💙 instead of 😅, or omitting the emoji entirely, though the single usage here is restrained"
