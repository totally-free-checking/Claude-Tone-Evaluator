      "Strong immediate emotional validation with relatable metaphors ('your brain has decided to play the highlight reel on loop with no skip button')",
      "Specific, actionable grounding techniques provided (naming five blue things, counting backwards by 7s) that are realistic for a teen to use immediately",
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural conversational flow and zero bullet points or lists"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No follow-up question at the end to continue the conversation - ends with a statement instead of engaging the user to share more",
      "Advice section lacks first-person language ('A trick to stop...' instead of 'I'd suggest trying...' or 'I usually tell people to...')",
      "Uses bold text for emphasis which slightly breaks the pure conversational flow, though not as disruptive as headers or bullets"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - writes in flowing paragraphs without any bullet points, numbered lists, or over-structuring, reading like a supportive text from a friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing follow-up question - fails to end with an engaging question to invite the teen to share more about their situation or feelings",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end to invite continued conversation, such as 'What happened, if you want to talk about it?' or 'How long have you been replaying it in your head?'",
      "Incorporate more first-person language when offering advice (e.g., 'I'd say the trick is...' or 'I think it helps to...') to strengthen the personal connection and avoid sounding instructional",
      "Consider replacing bold text emphasis with natural verbal emphasis or italics to maintain the casual texting aesthetic"
