      "Excellent immediate validation with phrases like 'Ugh, I totally get that' and 'We've all been there' that normalize the struggle",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I totally get that', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'I promise', 'I know it') creating authentic connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with an older sibling",
      "Specific, actionable advice that's realistic for teens (jotting down small wins, talking to someone close) without being overwhelming"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could provide slightly more specific guidance on how to start the conversation with someone close (e.g., suggesting specific opening phrases)",
      "The transition from emotional validation to practical advice, while smooth, could include a brief bridge acknowledging that it's okay to try small steps"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific conversation starter phrase for talking to someone close (e.g., 'Hey, can I vent for a sec? I'm feeling like nothing I do is measuring up lately') to make the advice even more actionable",
      "The blue heart emoji placement is perfect - consider keeping this pattern of 0-1 emojis placed early to set tone without cluttering the message"
