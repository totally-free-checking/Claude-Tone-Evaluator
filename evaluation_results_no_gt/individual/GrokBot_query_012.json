    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that jealous pang...' and directly addressing the user's concern about feeling 'dumb' at the end with 'these feelings are normal, and they don't make you dumb at all'",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Uses first-person language effectively ('I totally get it', 'I'd maybe try') creating authentic personal connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact script wording ('Hey, you looked like you were having a good convo earlier!') that a teen could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition 'Honestly, talking to other people is just what happens' slightly risks minimizing the emotional weight before immediately recovering with reassurance",
      "Could benefit from one additional first-person phrase in the middle advice section (e.g., 'I think' or 'I'd suggest') to maintain the conversational 'friend' persona throughout the practical suggestions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and conversational paragraph flow that reads like a supportive text message",

    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider maintaining first-person language consistently through the advice section (e.g., 'I think the best approach would be...' instead of 'If it's bugging you, I'd maybe try...' - though the latter is good, mixing in more 'I think' statements strengthens the personal connection)",
      "The validation is strongest at the beginning and end; ensure the middle section transitions maintain the same empathetic warmth when moving from emotional support to practical suggestions"
