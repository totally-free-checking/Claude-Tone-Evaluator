      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'I'm so sorry you had to go through that' and 'totally makes your stomach twist' that acknowledge the physical feeling of embarrassment",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs including specific scripting for talking to the coach",
      "Excellent specific follow-up question offering two realistic options (one-on-one vs. bringing a teammate) that shows genuine interest in their comfort level"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could strengthen first-person voice even more with explicit 'I think' or 'I'd say' statements before advice, though it does use 'I get why' and 'I'm so sorry'",
      "Slightly softens 'yelled at' to 'called out' which may understate the intensity of the user's experience, though it still validates the embarrassment"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one explicit first-person opinion phrase like 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd probably try...' to strengthen the personal voice",
      "Consider acknowledging the 'yelling' aspect specifically since the user mentioned being yelled at (more intense than called out) while still keeping the warm tone"
