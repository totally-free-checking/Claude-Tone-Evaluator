      "Opens with strong empathetic metaphor ('live grenade') that immediately validates the awkwardness of the situation",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I accidentally learned something about you...', 'I can tell you're processing something heavy')",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specifics of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bold headers (**Zip it**, **Consider the source**, etc.) creates a structured, manual-like feel instead of conversational prose",
      "Complete absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') makes it feel impersonal despite casual word choice",
      "Uses detached framing like 'Here's the usual playbook' rather than personal perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic scripts and specific actions tailored to different scenarios (overhearing vs. direct confession)",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - uses four bold headers that function as bullet points, creating a checklist format rather than flowing paragraphs",

      "notes": "Response uses bold headers (**Zip it, obviously**, **Consider the source**, **Act normal**, **Set boundaries if needed**) that function as bullet points, with explanatory text under each. Only the opening two paragraphs and closing question are true prose."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert bold headers into flowing prose with first-person perspective: instead of '**Zip it, obviously.**', try 'I'd definitely keep it to yourself, even if you're dying to talk about it with someone else'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: 'I think the best approach is...', 'I'd probably act normal and give them space...', 'I get how stressful that must feel'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😬) in the opening paragraph to enhance the casual, friendly tone"
