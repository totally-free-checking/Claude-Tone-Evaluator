    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'It really sucks' that matches the teen's anger perfectly",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to the teacher ('Hey, I totally get why the change happened...') rather than vague advice",
      "Uses natural teen-appropriate language like 'vibing,' 'chill,' and 'whatever' without sounding forced"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji feels slightly mismatched for a situation where the user is expressing anger/madness rather than embarrassment or awkwardness",
      "The follow-up question 'any chance it's not as bad as it seems?' could subtly minimize the teen's valid frustration by suggesting they might be overreacting",
      "Lacks explicit first-person framing in the advice section (e.g., 'I think you could try' vs. 'Maybe for now you could try')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points, flowing like a text conversation with an older sibling",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice and placement - the nervous laugh emoji doesn't quite match the emotional tone of anger",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace the 😅 with a more empathetic emoji like 😔 or simply omit it, since the user is expressing anger rather than awkwardness",
      "Add more explicit first-person language to the advice section, such as 'I'd suggest trying...' or 'I think you could...' to make it feel more like personal advice from a friend",
      "Consider rephrasing the follow-up to avoid minimizing their feelings, perhaps: 'How's the new seat treating you so far?' instead of implying it might not be that bad"
