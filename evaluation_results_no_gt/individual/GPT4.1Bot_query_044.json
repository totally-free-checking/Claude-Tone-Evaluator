    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' and relatable description of the blank-mind experience",
      "Natural first-person connection in validation section ('Seriously, I've totally been there') that builds rapport",
      "Specific, realistic script provided for what to say ('Sorry, my mind totally blanked for a second. Can you repeat the question?')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section shifts to impersonal second-person/general statements ('you could always,' 'most teachers will') rather than maintaining first-person language like 'I think you should' or 'I'd suggest'",

      "Add first-person framing to the advice section, such as 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd probably say something like...' to maintain the personal connection established in the validation section",
      "Consider adding a brief supportive closing like 'I'm here if you want to talk more about it' before the follow-up question to reinforce ongoing support"
