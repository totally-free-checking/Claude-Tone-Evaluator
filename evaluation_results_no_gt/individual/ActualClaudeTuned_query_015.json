      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' and 'I totally get why you're about to lose it' that mirror the teen's frustration",
      "Excellent use of first-person natural language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe try', 'I totally get') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact scripting ('I need some boundaries with my room/stuff because it's really stressing me out') and practical solutions (locks)",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with an older sibling"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly repetitive mention of locks ('lock for your door' and 'box you can lock' in close proximity)",
      "Could potentially benefit from one emoji (like 😤) to match the frustration energy of 'about to lose it,' though the absence is acceptable for the serious tone"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') that creates genuine connection without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriate to have none given the frustrated/serious tone, a single well-placed emoji could have enhanced the 'I get your anger' validation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider consolidating the lock suggestions into one smoother mention to avoid slight repetition",
      "While the absence of emojis works for this serious topic, consider adding one validating emoji (like 😤 or 😅) after 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' to visually match the emotional intensity"
