      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling' and acknowledging group project stress",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('Hey, the project is due tomorrow...') and realistic steps like contacting the instructor before the deadline"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely heavy reliance on numbered lists and formatting (5 main numbered sections with sub-bullets) instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Complete absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal despite casual word choice",
      "No follow-up question at the end to continue the conversation - just closes with 'Good luck'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific, realistic actions with example phrases that a teen can actually use immediately",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - reads like a wikiHow article or instruction manual rather than a supportive friend texting, with excessive structuring and numbered lists",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 5 numbered main sections with additional sub-bullets and bold formatting throughout. Only the opening sentence and closing sentence are natural prose. The advice is delivered entirely through structured lists rather than flowing paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the numbered advice sections into 2-3 natural paragraphs that flow conversationally, using transitions like 'I think your first move should be...' or 'Honestly, I'd probably...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: 'I get how frustrating that is', 'I'd say you should text them something like...', 'I'm here if you need to vent more'",
      "End with a specific, engaging question to continue the conversation like 'Have you talked to them at all yet, or is this totally out of the blue?' or 'What part of the project were they supposed to handle?'",
      "Reduce the formatting - remove bold headers and sub-bullets, and integrate the example scripts naturally into sentences rather than separating them as examples"
