    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, visceral validation ('Ugh, that's the worst') and physical empathy ('makes your heart drop') that makes the teen feel instantly understood",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I know it feels awful') creating genuine connection rather than clinical distance",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for confrontation ('Hey, I overheard you earlier—was that about me?') that a teen could actually use in the hallway"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The perspective shift ('it says way more about them than it does about you') comes slightly early before fully sitting with the hurt feelings, though it is buffered with empathy",
      "Could benefit from explicit 'I think' or 'I'd say' framing before the advice section to strengthen the first-person conversational stance even further"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with advice flowing organically within conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from validation to advice could use a slightly softer bridge or one more validating sentence before offering the 'it says more about them' perspective",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one more sentence of pure validation before the 'it says more about them' reframing to ensure the teen feels fully heard before getting perspective",
      "Consider adding explicit first-person framing like 'I think' or 'I'd probably' before the advice section to make it feel even more like personal advice from a friend rather than general suggestions"
