    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that hurts' and acknowledgment that feeling 'not enough' is the worst",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation with an older sibling",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrasing ('Hey, are you just hanging out with me because I'm friends with [the person]?') and the 'pull back' strategy"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person perspective language in the advice section (missing 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'In my experience') which makes the practical suggestions feel slightly impersonal",
      "Uses two questions at the end rather than one focused question, though both are specific and natural"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - immediately validates the painful feeling of being used and maintains empathetic tone throughout with phrases like 'honestly, that's the worst' and 'you deserve friends who lift you up'",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language usage - while it uses 'I promise,' the advice section relies on 'you could try' rather than 'I think you could' or 'I'd say,' missing opportunities to establish personal connection",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent natural prose throughout with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Uses italics for emphasis which is appropriate for conversational tone."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to advice sections (e.g., 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd probably ask them...') to make it feel more like personal guidance from a friend rather than generic suggestions",
      "Consider consolidating the two ending questions into one slightly more open-ended question like 'What specifically made you start feeling this way?' to keep the engagement focused while still inviting details"
