      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I promise you', 'I'd say', 'We're all human') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice could be slightly more specific on concrete techniques to stop the rumination loop beyond just talking to a friend",
