    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'My advice would be', 'I'd treat it') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's seriously the worst') and uses the heart emoji naturally to set a warm tone"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'it probably feels way more intense in your head than it will actually be' risks minimizing the teen's anxiety about being actively disliked, even if well-intentioned",
      "Could more explicitly validate the specific stress of the 'hates me' dynamic before pivoting to normalization"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining clear organization through paragraph breaks",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight minimization in suggesting the situation is 'way more intense in your head' could feel dismissive of the genuine social anxiety involved in being paired with someone who actively dislikes you",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or bold formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider acknowledging the specific pain of being actively disliked before the normalization ('it's super common') to ensure the teen feels fully seen in their discomfort",
      "The follow-up question about the project is good, but you could add one more validating phrase like 'I'm here if you need to vent more about this' to reinforce support before the question"
