    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so overwhelming!' and 'I totally get why that feels like way too much pressure' that makes the teen feel heard instantly",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd say' implied) creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides a specific, ready-to-use script for talking to parents: 'I know college is important, but I'm still figuring out what I'm interested in. Can we maybe focus on helping me explore different things this year instead of making big plans?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one more explicit validating phrase in the middle section to reinforce emotional support before transitioning to the 'parents are anxious too' perspective",
      "The transition from validating feelings to explaining parent anxiety is slightly abrupt, though still effective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight missed opportunity for an explicit 'I'm here for you' or similar closing supportive statement before the follow-up question, though the question itself shows engagement",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief validating bridge between acknowledging the pressure and explaining parent anxiety, such as 'That pressure is so real, and honestly?' to smooth the transition",
      "The response is exemplary overall; to reach perfection, consider ending with a slightly more open-ended invitation like 'I'm here if you want to talk through what they said' before the specific question about schools vs. general pressure"
