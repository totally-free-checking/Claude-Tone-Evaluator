      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I've been there', 'I promise', 'I'd say') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the absolute worst feeling' and 'gut-punch' acknowledging the visceral stress of the situation",
      "Specific, age-appropriate advice including checking the syllabus percentage and emailing teachers—realistic actions teens can actually take"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early on to enhance the casual tone, though the absence is appropriate for the serious topic",
      "The follow-up question, while good, could be slightly more personal/inviting (e.g., 'Want to vent about what happened?') rather than immediately pivoting to academics"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting—reads exactly like a supportive text from an older sibling or friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly generic reassurance 'Your grade is way more than just this one score' which, while true, is a common platitude compared to the otherwise specific advice",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early (like 😅 after 'Ugh') to match the '0-1 max' guideline for visual warmth, though the text-only approach works for academic stress",
      "The follow-up question could balance the forward-looking academic focus with emotional check-in, such as 'How are you feeling now that you've had a minute to breathe?' before asking about the next unit"
