    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe try', 'I get it' implied in the validation) creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with an older sibling or friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's such an awkward spot to be in!' that names the specific feeling before offering any advice"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to reframing ('Honestly though, I think this could actually turn out way better') could include one more sentence acknowledging the anxiety before pivoting to optimism",
