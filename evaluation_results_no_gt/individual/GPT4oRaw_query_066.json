      "Provides specific, actionable techniques like the 4-6 breathing method and 5-4-3-2-1 grounding that are realistic for teens to use immediately",
      "Ends with a warm validation ('you're doing the best you can') and a specific question about diving deeper into the ideas together"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured formatting with 6 numbered bullet points and markdown headers (### 1. **Breathe it out**), making it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person conversational language - missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' in favor of impersonal instructional language like 'Take some deep breaths' and 'Try the...'",
      "Transitions too quickly from brief validation to 'The good news is... there are things you can try,' minimizing the emotional weight before jumping to solutions"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, specific techniques (breathing counts, grounding method) that are immediately actionable for a teen experiencing stress",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses 6 numbered sections with headers and sub-bullets, creating a structured list format instead of flowing conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses markdown headers (###), bold text, and numbered lists extensively. Only the opening and closing sentences are prose; the entire middle section is structured as a list of techniques, resembling a wiki article or instruction manual rather than a supportive text message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as 2-3 flowing paragraphs instead of numbered bullets, integrating the techniques naturally into conversation (e.g., 'When I feel like that, I usually start with some deep breathing - have you tried inhaling for 4 seconds and exhaling for 6? It sounds simple but it really signals your brain to slow down.')",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: replace 'Take some deep breaths' with 'I'd suggest starting with some deep breaths' and 'Try the grounding technique' with 'I sometimes use this grounding technique called 5-4-3-2-1...'",
      "Spend more time validating the 'can't shut my brain off' feeling before offering solutions - sit with the emotion longer and acknowledge how exhausting that mental noise is before pivoting to 'here's what might help'"
