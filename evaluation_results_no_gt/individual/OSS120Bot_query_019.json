    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with highly relatable physical description ('makes your stomach drop') that captures the specific anxiety of being accused",
      "Excellent use of first-person advisory voice ('If I were you, I'd ask...') that creates a supportive peer-to-peer dynamic rather than lecturing",
      "Specific, actionable script provided for the conversation with the teacher ('I'm really surprised you think I cheated...') including concrete evidence to bring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reassurance section ('most teachers have seen this happen before') could include more first-person perspective like 'I've found that...' or 'I think...' to maintain the personal connection",
      "The advice section shifts briefly to imperative tone ('Bring any notes...') without the conversational buffer of 'I'd suggest you bring...' or 'I think showing them...'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - the response flows as conversational paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight dip in first-person language density in the middle section where it shifts to 'you could suggest' rather than maintaining the 'I think you should' or 'I'd suggest' voice established in the opening",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose structure with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice is integrated seamlessly into narrative sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' before the imperative advice in paragraph 3 to maintain first-person warmth throughout (e.g., 'I think you should bring any notes...')",
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase after the practical advice but before the question to reinforce emotional support after the problem-solving section"
