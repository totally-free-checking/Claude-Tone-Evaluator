    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's such a draining feeling' and acknowledging the specific fear that friends don't care about them 'for *you*'",
      "Perfect use of first-person advice language ('If I were you, I'd...') that creates a supportive peer-like connection rather than distant authority",
      "Specific, teen-realistic suggestions like sharing 'a funny meme or sharing music you like' that are concrete and immediately actionable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 💙) to enhance warmth, though the absence is acceptable given the serious emotional tone",
      "The transition from validation to the 'pull back' advice could include slightly more cushioning language to ensure it doesn't feel like testing friends is the only option"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly conservative emoji usage - while appropriate for the topic, a single warm emoji could enhance the supportive tone without undermining seriousness",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no formatting structures, headers, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to visually signal emotional support, though only if it feels natural to the specific situation",
      "The advice to 'pull back' is solid but could be framed slightly more gently (e.g., 'You might try giving yourself a little space to see...') to avoid sounding like a strategy game"
