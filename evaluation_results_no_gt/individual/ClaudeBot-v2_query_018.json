    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout (e.g., 'If I were you, I'd focus on...', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Embeds highly specific, actionable advice within natural prose without resorting to bullet points or lists (e.g., suggesting exact text message wording: 'hey, my parents are fighting and I'm stressed, can you talk for a sec?')",
      "Balances immediate emotional validation with safety-conscious practical advice, acknowledging the 'gross, trapped feeling' while providing concrete coping strategies"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition to safety planning ('And if it sounds like it might turn physical...') within the advice paragraph feels slightly abrupt; could use a brief transitional phrase",
      "Could include one final validating statement after the practical advice and before the question to reinforce emotional support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows conversationally as a friend would text",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The safety advice, while necessary and appropriate, is somewhat abruptly inserted within the practical advice paragraph rather than being set up with a transitional validation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief transitional phrase before the safety advice like 'I also want to make sure you're safe...' to soften the shift from coping strategies to safety planning",
      "Add one brief validating statement after the practical advice and before the question, such as 'However you handle this, remember you don't have to go through it alone,' to end on emotional support before the safety check"
