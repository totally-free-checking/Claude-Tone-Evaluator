    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd be so annoyed,' 'If I were in your shoes,' 'I trusted you') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the conversation ('Hey, I noticed my thing was pretty messed up...') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Balance slightly favors practical advice over emotional validation (could use one more sentence of validation before the 'If I were in your shoes' advice section)",
      "Emoji usage is appropriate at zero for this serious topic, though a subtle supportive emoji like 😅 or 💙 could enhance warmth without being excessive"

      "Consider adding one more sentence of validation before transitioning to advice (e.g., 'That betrayal stings so much') to strengthen the support-to-solutions ratio",
