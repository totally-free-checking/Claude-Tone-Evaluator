    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person empathetic language throughout ('I totally get that sinking feeling', 'I'd say your best move', 'we've all been in spots') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows naturally like a text conversation with four well-structured paragraphs",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen can use ('I swear I didn't cheat; we both arrived at the same answer this way') and realistic next steps (office hours, involving parents/counselor)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji feels slightly mismatched for the serious topic of academic integrity accusations - it works for awkward moments but may undercut the gravity of being falsely accused of cheating",
      "Could validate the emotional weight just slightly longer before moving to 'this happens often' normalization, though the balance is still quite good",
      "The follow-up question, while good, could be slightly more open-ended about feelings before asking about logistics ('How are you feeling about confronting them?' before asking about the class)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - maintains conversational flow throughout with advice embedded in narrative paragraphs rather than lists",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice (😅) for a serious accusation situation - while placed after a rhetorical question about physical sensations, a nervous sweat emoji may not fully match the gravity of potential academic consequences",

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider omitting the emoji or using a more supportive one (like 💙) for serious topics like academic integrity accusations, as 😅 can feel too light for potential disciplinary situations",
      "The follow-up question could start with an emotional check-in ('How are you holding up with all this?') before asking about the logistics of the class and teacher conversation",
      "Maintain the strong first-person voice - the current use of 'I think', 'I'd say', and 'I get it' is exactly what makes this feel like a supportive friend rather than a bot"
