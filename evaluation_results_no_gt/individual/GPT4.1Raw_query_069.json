      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question ('Do you want to share a bit more about what's happening?') that invites continued conversation",
      "Provides realistic, actionable advice about talking to trusted adults and considering intent/frequency/feelings"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a structured bullet point list with bold headers ('Intent:', 'Frequency:', 'How it makes you feel:') which breaks conversational flow and reads like a self-help article rather than a text from a friend",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout (missing 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') except for the final sentence, making it feel impersonal and clinical",
      "Opens with validation but quickly pivots to educational definitions rather than sustained emotional support"

      "notes": "Uses 'A few things to consider:' followed by three bullet points with bold headers (Intent, Frequency, How it makes you feel). This over-structuring makes it feel like an informational pamphlet rather than a supportive conversation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose: 'I'd start by thinking about their intent—are they actually trying to hurt your feelings or is it meant as a joke? Then consider how often it's happening...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: 'I think the hardest part is figuring out where that line is,' or 'I'd say trust your gut on this one.'",
      "Increase warmth upfront before educating: 'Ugh, that's such a confusing and stressful spot to be in. It makes total sense that you're not sure where the line is between teasing and bullying.'"
