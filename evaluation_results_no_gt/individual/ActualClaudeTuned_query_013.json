      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I totally get it', 'I know it sounds cliché') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation starting with 'Ugh' and acknowledging the specific physical symptom of shaking"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice, while realistic, relies on somewhat common suggestions (deep breathing, holding notes) that could be slightly more tailored",
      "Could include one more specific 'in the moment' technique beyond breathing (like the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding method) for immediate relief"

      "Consider adding one unexpected or novel practical tip alongside the breathing exercise to make the advice feel more personalized",
      "The double question at the end works but could be slightly more open-ended ('How are you feeling about the content?') rather than the yes/no implied in 'do you feel pretty prepared'"
