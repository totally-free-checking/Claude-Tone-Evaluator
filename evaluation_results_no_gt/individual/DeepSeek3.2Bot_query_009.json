    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'Ugh, that's such a gut-punch feeling' and acknowledging the 'invasion of privacy'",
      "Consistent, natural use of first-person language throughout ('Honestly, I think', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'I'm really sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, things have felt a little off since you checked my phone. Is there something we should talk about?'",
      "Ends with highly contextual follow-up question that digs into the specific type of 'weird' behavior rather than generic check-in"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'probably feels way bigger in your head than it does to them' could potentially minimize the teen's valid feelings, despite being intended as reassurance",
      "Could more strongly validate the anger/betrayal aspect of the privacy violation before moving to explain the parents' perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with zero bullet points or over-structuring while maintaining perfect emoji discipline (single 💙)",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight minimization in suggesting the situation is 'way bigger in your head,' which risks invalidating the very real emotional impact of a privacy violation before fully acknowledging the teen's right to feel betrayed",

      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure across four natural blocks with no bullets, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider validating the legitimacy of anger or betrayal about the privacy invasion slightly more explicitly before normalizing the parents' perspective to ensure the teen feels fully heard",
      "The follow-up question is excellent, but you might add one sentence explicitly reaffirming you're available to talk more (e.g., 'I'm here to help you figure this out') to strengthen the supportive presence"
