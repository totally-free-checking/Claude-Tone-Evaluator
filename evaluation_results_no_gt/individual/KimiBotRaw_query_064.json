    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation with specific, relatable language like 'that sinking feeling is the worst' and 'your stomach just dropped through the floor'",
      "Strong first-person conversational voice throughout using 'I totally get,' 'I promise,' and 'I know' which creates genuine connection",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice tailored to teen capabilities (retracing steps, checking 'weird zippered part,' texting friends, hitting up the office)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers ('**Right now:**', '**Next moves:**') breaks the natural prose flow ideal for teen support chats",
      "Structured like a listicle or article rather than a conversational text, with three separate formatted sections disrupting the warm, flowing tone"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses natural teen-appropriate expressions like 'hit up,' 'game plan,' and 'freaking out' while maintaining warmth through 'I' statements",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting structure - the multiple bullet lists with bold headers create a clinical, instructional feel rather than the natural paragraph-based conversation of a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "45%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold headers with two full bullet lists and one prose section. The heavy structuring (Right now, Next moves, The mental part) makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive text message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose paragraphs - instead of listing actions, weave them into sentences like 'First, I'd literally retrace your steps backwards through your day, then check all those weird pockets in your bag...'",
      "Remove the bold headers and section breaks entirely; let the advice flow naturally from the validation without signposting",
      "Combine the practical steps into 1-2 conversational paragraphs that feel like a friend talking through options rather than a checklist"
