    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - uses 'most of us' instead of personal connection",
      "The advice to 'catch a quick glimpse' of what they're saying could increase anxiety or feel invasive if the teen gets caught staring",

      "Consider adding a brief closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk more' to reinforce the supportive bot character"
