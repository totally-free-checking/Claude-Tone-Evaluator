      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as conversational paragraphs like a friend texting",
      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable examples teens can actually use (low-stakes compliment, specific phrasing 'Hey, want to hang out sometime?', concrete cues to watch for)",
      "Warm opening that validates the emotional experience ('that mix of excitement and nerves is such a classic roller-coaster', 'totally normal to feel a little unsure')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section lacks first-person language - uses impersonal 'You could...' and 'If you can, try to...' instead of 'I think you could...' or 'I'd suggest...' which creates distance rather than connection",
      "Opening with 'I'm so sorry' is slightly mismatched for the context of having a crush (which is exciting/nervous, not tragic), though it quickly recovers by acknowledging the excitement"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing first-person language in the advice section - delivers suggestions impersonally ('You could also test the water...') rather than using 'I think...' or 'I'd say...' to create personal connection",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to the advice section to sound more personal and supportive - instead of 'You could also test the water...' try 'I think you could test the water...' or 'I'd probably start with...'",
      "Consider opening with validation that matches the excitement of a crush rather than sympathy - something like 'Oh wow, that mix of excitement and nerves is such a classic roller-coaster, isn't it?' without the 'I'm so sorry' which fits better for sad situations"
