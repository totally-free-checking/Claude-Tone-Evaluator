    "strengths": [
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually say to the teacher (e.g., 'I'm really sorry — I genuinely forgot about the homework')",
      "Ends with a strong, engaging follow-up question that asks for specific details to continue the conversation",
      "Offers realistic, tiered advice based on different scenarios (can finish quickly vs. left at home vs. need extension)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses heavy bullet-point formatting and headers ('Best option:', 'If you can finish it quickly:') instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Lacks emotional validation beyond brief 'Oof — that happens' before immediately jumping to solutions",
      "Missing first-person conversational language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' — reads like an instruction manual rather than a friend texting"

      "notes": "Response relies heavily on formatted bullet lists under headers. Only the opening sentence and final paragraph are prose. The advice is delivered as a structured guide rather than natural conversation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'If you can finish it quickly, I'd suggest saying something like...' to make it feel like a friend texting rather than a manual",
      "Add more emotional validation upfront before giving advice — acknowledge the panic/sinking feeling of forgetting homework with something like 'That stomach-drop moment is the worst, and you're definitely not the only one who's done this'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅) early in the response to soften the tone, since the current text feels somewhat clinical despite the casual 'Oof'"
