    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific language about the 'gross, exposed feeling' and reassurance that anger/panic 'makes total sense'",
      "Uses natural first-person perspective throughout ('If I were you, I'd grab screenshots...', 'I'm so sorry') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides highly specific actionable advice including exact wording for confrontation ('Hey, you took/posted that without asking—please delete it now') and concrete steps (screenshots, privacy settings)",
      "Maintains pure conversational prose format without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Asks two questions at once at the end (platform and relationship status), which slightly dilutes the focus of the follow-up engagement",

      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two shorter paragraphs to improve readability on mobile while maintaining the prose format",
      "Focus the ending question on one specific angle (either the platform or the relationship to the person) to create more focused engagement, or separate them with a natural transition"
