    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows naturally in three conversational paragraphs",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact script wording ('Hey, I value our friendship a lot...') that teens can actually use",
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Oh no, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. That can really hurt...') acknowledging the pain of feeling used"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective throughout - missing 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' makes it feel impersonal rather than like a specific supportive person",
      "Fails to end with a follow-up question to continue the conversation - instead closes with a statement about deserving appreciation, missing the opportunity to re-engage",
      "Scatters multiple questions throughout ('Have you talked...?', 'how do you feel...?', 'Do you enjoy...?') which can feel overwhelming rather than having one natural closing question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with 100% paragraph structure and zero bullet points or over-formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person conversational language ('I think,' 'I'd say') and failure to end with an engaging follow-up question",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose with three flowing paragraphs. Uses italics for emphasis on 'you' and quotes for suggested dialogue, which are appropriate and don't disrupt the conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I'd suggest trying...' or 'I think the best approach would be...' and close with 'I'm here if you need to talk' to create personal connection",
      "Move the question to the very end of the response to encourage continued conversation, rather than scattering questions throughout and closing with a statement",
      "Consider adding more casual validating language like 'Ugh, that's such a rough feeling' or 'We've all been there' to increase warmth and relatability"
