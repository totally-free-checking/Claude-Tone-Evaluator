      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such a crappy feeling' and the relatable framing of being the 'convenient' vs 'wanted' person",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' that would make the advice feel more like a personal recommendation from a friend",
