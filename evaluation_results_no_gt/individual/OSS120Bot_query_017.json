      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd', 'I get why it'd have you overthinking') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts for the teen to use ('I've noticed a couple of things and I'm a bit uncomfortable—do you see it too?') rather than vague advice",

      "Could acknowledge the specific emotional complexity of questioning a friend's boyfriend (fear of not being believed, risking the friendship) to deepen validation",
