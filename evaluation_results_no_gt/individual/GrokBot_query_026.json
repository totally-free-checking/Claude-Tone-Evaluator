    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout creates authentic connection ('I've totally been there with my own family stuff', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'Sometimes I find')",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that pre-talk annoyance is so real' followed by relatable metaphor about defenses going up",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'I get that my attitude's bugging you, but I've been stressed about [whatever's on your mind]'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question focuses on the dad's perspective ('What do you think sparked this whole 'attitude' thing from his perspective?') which could feel slightly less validating than asking about the teen's feelings first",
      "The transition from validation to reframing ('these convos often aren't as confrontational as they seem') happens quickly; could use one more sentence acknowledging the annoyance before shifting to perspective-taking"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural first-person language and conversational prose format - consistently uses 'I' statements ('I'd try', 'I get it', 'I've been there') that make it feel like a real person texting rather than an AI giving instructions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question could be more centered on the teen's experience rather than asking them to analyze their dad's perspective, though it does maintain engagement",

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or bullet points. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed as steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider extending the validation phase by one more sentence before offering the reframe about the dad's intentions, to ensure the teen feels fully heard",
      "The follow-up question could be modified to focus on the teen's feelings first (e.g., 'What part of the conversation is stressing you out most?') before asking about the dad's perspective, maintaining the supportive stance while still engaging"
