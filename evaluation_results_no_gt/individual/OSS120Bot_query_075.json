    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates genuine connection: 'I get why it feels super awkward,' 'If I were you, I'd maybe text the host,' and 'I'd say' framing makes it feel like a real friend texting",
      "Specific actionable advice with exact scripts: suggesting they text the host, show up early, bring a snack, and providing the exact words 'Hey, I'm [your name]—I'm kinda new here' gives teens concrete tools they can actually use",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—flows naturally from validation to advice to question like a real conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The closing question is slightly compound, asking two things at once ('Are you thinking about reaching out to the host first, or do you have any backup plans...'), which while conversational, slightly dilutes the focus of the engagement",
      "The reassurance 'it's not as huge a deal as it seems' could potentially minimize the anxiety slightly, though it's softened by the surrounding empathetic language"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question combines two separate inquiries (host outreach vs. backup plans) rather than focusing on one specific angle to deepen the conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider focusing the closing question to one specific angle (e.g., 'What's making you more nervous—reaching out to the host or walking in alone?') rather than the either/or structure to invite deeper sharing",
      "The validation is strong, but you could add one more 'I'm here' or 'I've got you' type statement to reinforce that you're sitting with them in the feeling before moving to solutions"
