    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you', 'I'd start', 'I know the feeling') which creates genuine connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's always a nerve-racking moment!') and normalizes the anxiety ('you picture all the ways they might say no')",
      "Provides specific, realistic script the teen can actually use word-for-word ('Hey, I got invited to this party at [friend's name]'s place...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) early in the response to visually match the 'Ugh' sentiment, though the absence is still acceptable",
      "Validation is strong but brief; could spend one more sentence acknowledging the specific fear of rejection before moving to solutions"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and natural first-person language use - sounds exactly like a supportive older sibling texting advice",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) after the opening validation to enhance the casual, friendly tone",
