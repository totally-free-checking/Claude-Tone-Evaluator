    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'sink straight through the floor' that viscerally captures the exact cringe feeling the teen described",
      "Strong natural first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I promise you', 'I'd just let it go') creating authentic peer-like connection rather than distant advice-giving",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for handling potential teasing: 'Whoops, my brain short-circuited!' which is actually usable in the moment"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could acknowledge the specific intensity of 'wanting to disappear' slightly more before pivoting to normalization",
      "Advice section focuses only on the teacher forgetting; could briefly address what to do if the teacher did react noticeably or if classmates keep bringing it up"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational prose format with zero bullets or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from emotional validation to practical advice could include one more sentence acknowledging the lingering embarrassment before moving to 'let it go'",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullets, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one sentence specifically naming the 'want to disappear' feeling (e.g., 'That urge to just vanish is so valid right now') before the normalization to make the teen feel truly seen",
      "The follow-up question is good, but could include an emotional check-in like 'Are you still feeling super embarrassed or starting to laugh about it?' alongside the factual question about the teacher's reaction"
