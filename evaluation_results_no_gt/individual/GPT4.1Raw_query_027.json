    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, I totally get it' and acknowledging the 'stuck' feeling as super common",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'Let’s break this down together', 'I can help you') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen executive function struggles (pick one assignment, write name, open document)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one emoji (like 😅 or 💪) early on to enhance warmth, though the absence is acceptable for this stressed context",
      "The transition to advice could acknowledge the specific overwhelm of having five assignments before jumping to the solution"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriate to have none for this stressed academic context, a single well-placed emoji could have added extra warmth and visual friendliness",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one emoji at the start (like 😅) to visually signal warmth, though the text alone is warm enough",
      "Could briefly name the specific stress of 'five assignments' before offering the solution to show deeper listening",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be slightly more specific by referencing the 'five assignments' count explicitly"
