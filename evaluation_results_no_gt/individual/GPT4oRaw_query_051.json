    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I hear you,' 'we can brainstorm') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with explicit permission to feel hurt ('It's okay to feel hurt—it's valid')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with a statement/invitation rather than a specific follow-up question to continue the conversation",
      "Lacks emojis that could enhance warmth for this emotionally painful topic—a gentle 💙 or 😔 would fit naturally",
      "Advice is somewhat general; doesn't provide specific conversation starters or scripts the teen could actually use"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero structural elements (bullets, headers, bold text)",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as three flowing paragraphs with no lists, headers, or over-formatting. Advice is integrated naturally into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "End with a specific, natural question like 'Do you think they'd be receptive if you brought this up?' or 'What's your gut telling you about these friendships?' to keep the conversation going",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to match the emotional weight of feeling like a backup friend",
      "Include specific script suggestions for opening the conversation, such as 'You could try saying: I've been feeling a bit like I'm on the sidelines lately, and I miss hanging out one-on-one'"
