      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I think') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - advice flows conversationally within paragraphs like 'I'd say pick a chill moment when they're not super busy...'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen the emotional validation by explicitly naming the fear of rejection or disappointment before moving to solutions",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any corporate structuring or bullet points",

      "Consider adding one more layer of emotional validation explicitly naming the fear ('I know it can feel scary worrying they might say no or judge your friends') before the practical advice",
