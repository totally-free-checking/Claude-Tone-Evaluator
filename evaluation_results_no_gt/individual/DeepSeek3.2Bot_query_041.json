      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, the worst!' and vivid empathetic description of 'that hollow feeling in your stomach'",
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a genuine text conversation",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I'd try,' 'I promise,' 'I'd check') creating authentic personal connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could more explicitly validate the 'trying not to be dramatic' self-awareness, though it does address this indirectly with 'it feels so dramatic in the moment'",
      "The advice section, while excellent, could flow even more seamlessly from the validation with a transitional phrase like 'Here's what I'd do'"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider explicitly naming the 'trying not to be dramatic' feeling to show deeper attunement to that specific emotional concern",
      "Maintain this excellent balance of first-person language and prose formatting; the casual contractions and phrases like 'the actual pits' and 'people are usually pretty cool about it' hit the right teen-appropriate tone without trying too hard"
