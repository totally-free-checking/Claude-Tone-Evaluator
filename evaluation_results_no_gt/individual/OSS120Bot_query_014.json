    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get why', 'If I were you', 'I'd start') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation using relatable metaphors ('secret buzzing in your head', 'inside scoop can feel super heavy')",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, thanks for sharing that with me. I want to respect what you told me...'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slight minimization with 'it usually isn't as dramatic as it seems' could potentially invalidate the teen's current anxiety, though it's minor",
      "Transition from validation to advice with 'The good news is' feels slightly abrupt - could use one more validating sentence before pivoting to solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow with consistent first-person perspective ('I get why', 'If I were you') that makes it feel like texting with a supportive friend rather than reading a self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The phrase 'it usually isn't as dramatic as it seems' risks minimizing the teen's feelings slightly by suggesting their worry is overblown before fully sitting with the discomfort",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with natural transitions between ideas. Advice is woven into conversational sentences rather than listed as steps. No headers, bold text, or structural formatting used."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase before 'The good news is' to fully acknowledge the weight of the situation before pivoting to reassurance",
      "The follow-up question is good but could be slightly more open-ended like 'What feels scarier - keeping it quiet or asking them what they need?' to invite deeper reflection rather than just a yes/no feeling check"
