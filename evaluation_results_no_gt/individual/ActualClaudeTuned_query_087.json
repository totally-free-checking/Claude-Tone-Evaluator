    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think most people', 'I'd probably try', 'I think being upfront') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed lately and need some time to recharge'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation with a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question combines two questions ('How long has this been going on, and do you think they realize...') which is slightly less focused than a single engaging question",
      "The 😅 emoji in the opening might slightly mismatch the 'tough spot' sentiment (😬 or 😓 could fit better), though 😅 works for the awkwardness of the situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person perspective ('I'd probably try', 'I think') that makes it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling rather than receiving generic advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The emoji choice in the opening sentence, while acceptable, could be more precisely matched to the emotional weight of feeling suffocated by a friend",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no lists, headers, or bold formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using a single focused follow-up question rather than combining two, though the current phrasing is still conversational",
      "The gradual boundary-setting advice ('taking longer to respond to texts') is excellent - keep providing these specific, low-stakes actionable steps",
      "The validation that 'needing space doesn't make you a bad friend' is perfectly positioned before offering solutions - maintain this validation-first structure"
