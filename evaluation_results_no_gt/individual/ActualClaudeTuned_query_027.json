      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('when I'm stuck like that', 'I think the best thing', 'Sometimes I find') creating genuine connection",

      "Transition from validation to advice ('Honestly, when I'm stuck...') could include one more validating sentence to strengthen the emotional support before problem-solving",
