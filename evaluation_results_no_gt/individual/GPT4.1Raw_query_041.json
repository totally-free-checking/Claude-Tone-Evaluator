      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural conversational flow",
      "Validates feelings immediately with 'Oh no! That's never fun' and acknowledges the suckiness with 'That seriously stinks'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Too brief - only one short paragraph when the ideal is 2-4 paragraphs, risking feeling dismissive despite good intentions",
      "Doesn't provide actual practical suggestions for the forgotten lunch situation, only offers to brainstorm later",

      "Add 1-2 concrete suggestions (like 'Maybe the cafeteria has emergency pizza?' or 'Any chance a friend could spot you?') before asking if they want more help",
      "Expand to 2-3 paragraphs to include more validation about the 'trying not to be dramatic' feeling - acknowledge that it's valid to feel upset even about small things",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the supportive tone, or expand the 'I've got you' into more first-person language like 'I totally get that sinking feeling when you realize it'"
