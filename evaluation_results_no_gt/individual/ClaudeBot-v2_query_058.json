    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific physical description ('That nervous, tight-chest feeling is so real') that makes the teen feel truly seen",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact phrases to say ('I'm kind of nervous to be here...') and concrete tools (writing 2-3 notes in phone)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more explicit first-person supportive language like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or 'I get it' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "The phrase 'If it helps' is slightly impersonal compared to 'I think this might help' or similar first-person framing"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains perfect conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight lack of explicit 'I'm here for you' type first-person supportive statements that would make the support feel more personally present",

      "Consider adding a brief first-person supportive closing like 'I'm here if you want to talk more' alongside the question to reinforce personal presence",
      "Replace 'If it helps' with 'I think this might help' or similar to maintain the first-person conversational voice throughout"
