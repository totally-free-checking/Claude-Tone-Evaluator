    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that stings' and 'hits right in the gut' that acknowledge the specific pain of being left out",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I've totally been there', 'If I were you, I might...') creating a personal, supportive connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the opening to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though the absence is still appropriate",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) after the opening validation to reinforce the casual, friendly tone",
      "The balance between validation and advice is excellent - continue leading with emotional acknowledgment before offering solutions"
