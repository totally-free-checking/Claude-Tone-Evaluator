    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, forgetting your lunch is the worst') that mirrors the user's frustration and uses relatable imagery ('that moment when your stomach growls')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows naturally as conversational text like a friend texting",
      "Excellent emoji usage with exactly one well-placed 😅 that enhances the warm, self-deprecating tone without being excessive",
      "Specific, realistic advice tailored to the school context (asking teachers about emergency snacks, vending machines, sharing with friends) rather than generic suggestions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could strengthen first-person connection with more 'I' statements (currently only has 'I'd say' and 'I bet' but lacks 'I think,' 'I get it,' or 'I'm here')",
      "Practical advice could include specific scripting suggestions for what to actually say when asking a friend or teacher for help"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - maintains conversational flow throughout all three paragraphs without any lists or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language usage - while it has some ('I'd say,' 'I bet'), it misses opportunities for deeper personal connection with statements like 'I totally get that' or 'I'm here if you need to vent'",

    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one or two more first-person connection phrases like 'I totally get that feeling' or 'I've definitely been there' to strengthen the personal bond",
      "Include specific script suggestions for approaching friends/teachers (e.g., 'You could try saying something like, Hey, I totally spaced on packing lunch today - could I grab a few of your chips?')"
