    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get why you're annoyed', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use ('Hey, when you say X it kinda feels more hurtful than funny—can we tone it down?')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for acknowledging awkwardness, might slightly underplay the hurt feelings for a serious situation about insults",
      "Could include slightly more emotional validation before transitioning to the 'good news' and advice section"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero structural formatting—maintains the 'friend texting' feel perfectly throughout all four paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The balance leans slightly toward practical advice over emotional validation, with the longest paragraph dedicated to specific confrontation strategies rather than exploring the emotional impact",

      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure emotional validation before moving to solutions, such as acknowledging how confusing it must feel when a friend is the source of hurt",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of engagement in future responses"
