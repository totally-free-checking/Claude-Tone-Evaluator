    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'm sorry','I'm here to listen') creating genuine personal connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh man, I'm sorry','it sounds really frustrating') before moving to advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Fails to end with a follow-up question to continue the conversation - closes with 'Whatever you need!' instead of an engaging question",
      "Practical advice, while realistic, could be more specific (e.g., offering actual phrases to use when talking to parents)",
      "Lacks emojis entirely which could have enhanced warmth for this frustrating situation (though this is minor)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - perfectly conversational paragraphs without any bullets, headers, or over-structuring that reads like a real text conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - although it contains a question mid-text ('Have you tried talking...'), it fails to end with a question to invite continued dialogue, closing the conversation instead of opening it",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with two natural paragraphs, no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "End with a specific, engaging question like 'Who's usually doing the comparing - your parents or teachers?' or 'What kind of comparisons bug you the most?' to invite the teen to share more",
      "Consider adding one warmth-enhancing emoji early in the response (like 😤 or 💙) to match the 'it sucks' energy of the query",
      "Provide specific script examples for talking to the person making comparisons, such as: 'You could try saying: \"I know you don't mean to, but when you compare me to [sibling], it makes me feel like I'm not good enough on my own.\"'"
