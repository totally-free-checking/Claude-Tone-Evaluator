    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads as a natural conversational flow",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh no, that's really frustrating!') that acknowledges the disappointment",
      "Ends with a specific, natural follow-up question ('Have you talked to them about it yet?') that invites continued dialogue"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal constructions like 'it can feel disappointing' and 'it might help' instead of 'I'd be so upset' or 'I think you should'",
      "Advice is vague regarding outcomes ('make it right somehow' doesn't specify replacement, repair, or apology)",
      "Missing the casual, relatable interjections that signal peer-level connection (no 'Ugh' or 'Honestly' or 'I've totally been there')"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Integrate first-person perspective throughout: change 'it can feel disappointing' to 'I'd be so disappointed' and 'it might help' to 'I think it helps' to create authentic connection",
      "Specify what 'making it right' means - suggest concrete options like 'asking them to replace it' or 'helping fix it' rather than vague language",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😬 or 💙) after the opening validation to enhance the supportive tone without overdoing it"
