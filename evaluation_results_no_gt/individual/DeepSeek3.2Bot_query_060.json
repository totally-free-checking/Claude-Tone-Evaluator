    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that is such a tough and awkward spot' acknowledging the specific discomfort",
      "Specific, actionable advice realistic for teen agency (being on time, helping clean up, specific phrases to use)",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions back-to-back rather than one flowing question, which slightly disrupts the conversational rhythm",
      "The advice section uses slightly more formal phrasing ('the most polite, respectful version of yourself') compared to the very casual opening, creating a minor tone shift"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with consistent first-person language ('I think it's a lot more common', 'I'd say the best approach') that creates genuine conversational warmth without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up engagement uses two separate questions ('How does your friend feel...? Have they mentioned...?') rather than a single natural question, which is slightly less ideal than one flowing inquiry",

      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, perfectly matching the ideal conversational format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Combine the two final questions into one flowing question like 'How does your friend feel about it—have they mentioned anything to you?' to avoid the 'multiple questions' red flag",
      "Consider maintaining the casual 'Ugh' energy throughout the advice section by using slightly less formal phrasing like 'just be your normal polite self' instead of 'the most polite, respectful version of yourself'"
