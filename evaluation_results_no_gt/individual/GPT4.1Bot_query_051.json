      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that hurts so much' and specific acknowledgment of the 'second choice' pain",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd probably,' 'I promise,' 'I'm really sorry') creating genuine connection",

      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 💙) to enhance warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the serious tone",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) at the start if it feels natural, though the serious tone makes the absence acceptable",

      "The advice to 'step back just a tiny bit' is excellent but could include a brief reassurance that it's okay to protect their energy while doing so"
