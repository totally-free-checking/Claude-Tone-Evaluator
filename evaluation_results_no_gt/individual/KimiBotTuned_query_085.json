      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('I'm not trying to pick sides, I'm gonna step away') and concrete actions (headphones, bathroom break)",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's so draining') and normalizes the experience without dismissing it"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person narrator voice throughout - uses impersonal constructions like 'If you can, try stepping out' and 'It can also help' instead of 'I'd suggest stepping out' or 'I think you should try'",
      "Missing explicit supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk' that would reinforce the personal connection"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with specific scripted advice - it avoids all bullet points while giving concrete, realistic scripts a teen could actually say in the moment",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of first-person perspective statements ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') makes the advice feel slightly impersonal despite the warm tone",

      "Add first-person perspective statements like 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd suggest trying...' to create a stronger personal connection and match the 'supportive friend' character",
