    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation: 'That really hurts, and it makes sense you'd feel crushed by it' acknowledges the pain immediately",
      "Provides excellent specific scripts for difficult conversations, like the suggested wording: 'I've been feeling like I'm not a priority sometimes...' which gives teens exact language to use",
      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question that invites deeper sharing about the particular situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' anywhere, making it feel like an advice column rather than a supportive friend",
      "Severely over-structured with markdown headers (###), bullet points, and numbered lists instead of conversational prose paragraphs",
      "Jumps quickly from one sentence of validation into massive amounts of structured advice, creating an imbalanced 'fix-it' vibe rather than emotional support first"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific conversation scripts and boundary-setting examples are realistic and immediately actionable for teens",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response uses headers, bullet lists, and numbered steps (1-5) extensively, reading like a wikiHow article rather than a text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses ### headers, a 5-item bullet list for 'signs,' and a 5-step numbered list with sub-bullets. Only the first sentence and final question are true prose. Heavy formatting destroys conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as natural paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd maybe say something like...' instead of numbered steps and headers",
      "Move the 'signs' list into a conversational sentence format like 'I wonder if you're noticing patterns like...' rather than bullet points",
      "Add more emotional validation throughout - after each piece of advice, return to validating feelings with phrases like 'I know that's hard though' or 'That takes courage'",
      "Remove all markdown formatting (###, **bold**, bullet points) to match the 'texting a friend' aesthetic"
