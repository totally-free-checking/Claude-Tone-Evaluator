    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get why', 'If I were you', 'I'd probably', 'I think') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' and 'pit-in-your-stomach dread' that normalizes the anxiety",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use when talking to parents"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition 'Honestly though' slightly minimizes the emotional validation before moving to solutions, though it recovers well",
      "The follow-up question combines two questions (subject and parent reaction) which is slightly less focused than a single engaging question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs, no lists or headers, advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider softening the transition to advice with something like 'That said, I think...' instead of 'Honestly though' to maintain the validating tone",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more focused by asking just about the parents' likely reaction or just about the subject, rather than both, to invite deeper sharing on one topic"
