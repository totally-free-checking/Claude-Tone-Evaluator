    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation starting with 'Ugh' and vividly describing the physical discomfort of the situation ('you can feel the weirdness in the room')",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact phrases the teen can use when talking to their friend ('I feel like your parents don't really like me—did something happen...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language from the bot's perspective (missing 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it' statements that would make it feel more like personal advice from a friend)",
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for awkwardness, might slightly understate the emotional weight of parental disapproval compared to a more supportive emoji like 💙 or simply no emoji for this specific scenario"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - perfectly maintains conversational paragraph structure without any bullet points, headers, or over-formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language usage - despite being conversational, it relies on general statements ('the best move is usually') rather than personal perspective ('I'd say the best move is')",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely natural prose paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add explicit first-person perspective statements like 'I think you should...' or 'I'd probably try...' to make the advice feel more like it's coming from a specific supportive person rather than general wisdom",
      "Consider either omitting the emoji or using a warmer one (like 💙) since 😅 can sometimes minimize the hurt feelings involved when parents actively dislike someone, though the usage here is acceptable for the 'awkward' framing"
