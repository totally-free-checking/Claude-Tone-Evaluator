    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I know that feeling' and 'you're not alone' that makes the teen feel seen",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with an older sibling",
      "Uses first-person language naturally ('I know', 'I promise') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, realistic activity suggestions (coding, cooking, sports) that acknowledge exploration is a process"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions presented as alternatives which could slightly dilute the engagement compared to one focused question",
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early on to enhance visual warmth, though the text warmth is strong"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up uses a double-question format ('Have you... Or...') which slightly risks feeling like an interrogation rather than a single open invitation to share",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with natural transitions. No formatting crutches used - advice flows within sentences rather than lists."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider condensing the final two questions into one open-ended question like 'What's something you've been curious about trying, even if it seems random?' to avoid the 'interview' feeling of multiple questions",
      "Adding one subtle emoji after the opening validation (e.g., 'Ugh, I know that feeling 😅') could enhance the warm tone without being excessive"
