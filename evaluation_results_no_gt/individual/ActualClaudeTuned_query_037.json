    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry - that's honestly one of the worst feelings!' that immediately makes the teen feel heard",
      "Excellent use of first-person conversational language throughout ('I think our brains automatically jump...', 'I'd try not to overthink it too much') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice slightly conflicts with the severity of 'one of the worst feelings' and could potentially minimize the emotional weight for some users",
      "Practical advice, while realistic, could be more specific by offering exact phrasing the teen could use when approaching the person (e.g., 'Hey, I overheard my name earlier...')"

    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider replacing 😅 with 💙 or 😊 to maintain warmth without potentially minimizing the 'worst feelings' severity, or remove the emoji entirely since the prose is already warm enough",
      "Add one specific script example for the advice about asking the person, such as: 'You could just say something like, \"Hey, I think I caught my name earlier - were you guys talking about the project?\"' to make the advice immediately actionable"
