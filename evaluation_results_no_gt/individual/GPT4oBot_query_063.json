      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oh no, that's the worst!' and vivid acknowledgment of the 'quick wave of panic'",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow",
      "Specific actionable script provided ('Oops, wrong class!') that gives exact words to use",

      "Uses second-person 'you could' instead of first-person language like 'I'd say' or 'I think' when giving advice",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace second-person advice like 'you could totally laugh about it' with first-person perspective such as 'I'd probably just laugh it off and say...' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Combine the two final questions into one flowing question like 'What class were you trying to find, and did you make it there okay?' or select the most engaging single question to avoid overwhelming the user with multiple prompts"
