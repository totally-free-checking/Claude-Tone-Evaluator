    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry—you know that hollow, left-out feeling' that names the specific emotion and makes the teen feel seen",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I get it') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than detached advice",
      "Specific, actionable suggestions that are realistic for teens ('joining a club for a month, following a beginner tutorial, volunteering once') rather than vague platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While the serious tone is appropriate for the topic, one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😅) could enhance warmth without undermining the gravity of the feeling",
      "The response is slightly dense; breaking the third paragraph into two shorter ones might improve mobile readability, though this is minor"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The perfect balance of emotional validation and practical advice—starting with empathy ('rough headspace'), offering perspective ('way less real than it looks'), then concrete steps, ending with engagement",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of emoji—while appropriate for the serious topic, a single supportive emoji could enhance the warm, casual character without detracting from the validation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullets, headers, or over-structuring. The advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs, reading like a supportive friend texting rather than a self-help article"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😊) early in the response to signal warmth while maintaining the serious, validating tone",
      "The third paragraph is slightly long—consider breaking after 'tiny project' to create more white space for mobile readability, though the content itself is excellent"
