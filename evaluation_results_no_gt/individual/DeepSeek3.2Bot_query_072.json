    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific empathetic language ('I'm so sorry', 'That sinking dread... is super real', 'special kind of awkward')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with 4 well-sized paragraphs",
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrase to use ('Well, let's just get through this!') and realistic perspective about teacher expectations"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question combines two distinct queries (partner choice vs. teacher assignment) which slightly dilutes the conversational focus",
      "Could potentially use slightly more casual contractions or filler words ('honestly', 'like') to enhance the 'friend texting' vibe, though current tone is strong"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Simplify the closing question to focus on one specific angle rather than offering two options (e.g., 'Who are you hoping to pair up with?' OR 'Does the teacher usually assign partners?')",
      "Consider adding one more casual validation phrase like 'ugh' or 'honestly' early in the second paragraph to match the opening warmth, though the current tone is already quite good"
