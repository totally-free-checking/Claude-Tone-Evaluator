    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'I totally get that feeling!' and vivid description of the social comparison experience",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'honestly') creating a personal connection",
      "Natural conversational phrasing like 'capital-T Thing' and 'stumbled across what clicks' that feels authentic without trying too hard"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section could include one concrete example of a small hobby or interest to explore, making it more actionable",
      "While the absence of emojis is appropriate for the tone, a single subtle emoji (like 🤔) could enhance warmth slightly"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, or over-formatting. Uses natural paragraph breaks that flow like conversation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one concrete example of a low-pressure way to explore interests (like 'trying a new playlist genre' or 'doodling while watching shows') to make the advice more actionable",
      "The response is strong overall; maintain this balance of validation-first followed by perspective-shifting advice"
