    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for what to say: 'Heard you all did something fun the other day—looked like a good time!'",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation: 'Ah, that's a tough feeling—it's totally normal to feel a little left out'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective throughout - uses 'maybe you could' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think' which makes it feel impersonal",
      "Asks two questions rather than consolidating into one natural closing question",
      "Could use slightly more warmth/empathy in the validation - 'a little left out' understates the potential hurt"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making the advice feel like general guidance rather than personal support from a friend",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose paragraphs with no lists, headers, or over-formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective to make it feel more personal: change 'maybe you could gently mention it' to 'I'd probably just gently mention it' or 'I think you could try saying...'",
      "Use one well-placed emoji early in the response (like 😕 or 💙) to enhance warmth when acknowledging the hurt feelings",
      "Consolidate the two questions into one specific closing question rather than asking 'Did you notice...' in the middle and 'How are you feeling' at the end - perhaps: 'Do you think this was just a one-time thing, or has it been a pattern lately?'"
