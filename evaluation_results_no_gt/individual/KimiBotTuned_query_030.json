    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying' and acknowledging the 'weird spot' between wanting to be a good friend and feeling frustrated",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with specific scripts woven into paragraphs ('I'm not gonna share my homework anymore...')",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact phrases to say and a strategy for handling pushback (repeating the same line without arguing)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective from the bot - uses 'you can' and imperative advice rather than 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' (e.g., says 'you can keep it simple' instead of 'I'd suggest keeping it simple')",
      "Could include slightly more explicit personal validation like 'I get why you're frustrated' before moving to the solution phase"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - maintains conversational flow throughout while embedding specific advice within paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone lacks first-person 'I' statements from the bot's perspective, making it slightly more impersonal than the ideal 'I think'/'I'd say' approach",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with natural transitions between validation, advice, and follow-up. No lists, headers, or bold text. Advice is integrated into sentences rather than formatted as steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective to increase warmth and personal connection - change 'you can keep it simple' to 'I think you should keep it simple' or 'I'd suggest saying something like'",
      "Consider adding one more 'I get it' or 'I've seen this happen' type statement early on to establish the bot's personal stance before giving advice"
