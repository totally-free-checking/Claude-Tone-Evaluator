      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so exhausting!' and acknowledging the draining nature of friend group drama",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs like 'You could hang out with people one-on-one instead'",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('okay anyway, did you guys see that new movie?') that teens can actually implement"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include more first-person language throughout (only uses 'I think' once; missing opportunities for 'I'd say' or 'I get it')",
      "While the 😅 emoji is appropriately sparse, it slightly conflicts with the 'exhausting' emotional weight - a 💙 or 😊 might have matched the supportive tone better, though this is minor"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and structured lists while delivering practical advice in paragraph form",

      "Add 1-2 more first-person phrases like 'I'd say' or 'I totally get why that feels heavy' to strengthen the personal connection",
