      "Excellent specific scripts and actionable strategies (e.g., 'Yeah, that's not true, but I'm not worried about it' and the 'gray rock' approach)",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy over-reliance on bullet points and bold headers makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Lacks first-person empathetic language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get how awful that feels') - feels instructional rather than relational",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides realistic, specific scripts and distinguishes well between petty drama vs. serious situations",

      "notes": "Response uses bold headers (**If it's petty...**, **If it's actually damaging...**, **The 'gray rock' script...**) followed by bullet lists. Only the opening and closing are prose. Reads like a structured guide rather than a text conversation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs - instead of listing strategies, weave them into a conversational flow like 'If it's just petty drama, I'd honestly just starve it of oxygen. Don't post those vague stories or ask who said it...'",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout - 'I know how powerless that feels,' 'I'd be so upset too,' or 'I'm here if you need to vent' to create a relational connection rather than just giving advice",
      "Move some of the extensive tactical advice into a gentler, more supportive framework - validate the emotional impact for longer before diving into the 'here's what you do' section",
      "Remove bold headers and formatting - they create distance rather than intimacy. Just use natural transitions between ideas."
