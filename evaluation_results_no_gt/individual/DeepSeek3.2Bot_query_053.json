    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong immediate validation: 'I'm so sorry - that's so frustrating' and acknowledges the self-doubt ('makes you wonder if you did something wrong')",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I think the best thing to do', 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal connection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I've noticed you've had to cancel a few times lately—everything okay?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother; it moves quickly from acknowledging feelings to explaining the friend's perspective",
      "The emoji choice (😕) fits the disappointment but a slightly warmer emoji might enhance the supportive tone even more"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight pivot from emotional validation to rationalization ('it's probably more about their own schedule') happens quickly, though it does return to empathy",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure validation between the first and second paragraphs to fully sit with the emotional impact before moving to perspective-taking",
      "The response is excellent overall - maintain this level of specific scripting for advice and natural conversational flow"
