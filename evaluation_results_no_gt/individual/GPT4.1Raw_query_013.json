    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('It's totally normal to feel nervous') that normalizes the physical anxiety response",
      "Provides specific, actionable techniques (4-4-4 breathing, flicking wrists, using a clicker) that are realistic for a teen to use right before presenting",
      "Ends with supportive first-person availability ('I'm here') and encouragement ('You've got this')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured bullet points (5 numbered items with bold headers) rather than conversational prose flow",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout the body ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') making it feel more like an instructional article than a personal conversation",
      "No actual follow-up question to continue the dialogue—only an open-ended offer for help"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, immediately usable techniques like the 4-4-4 breathing method and physical grounding tips that are perfect for the situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - uses a heavily structured numbered list format with bold headers that reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses a 5-item numbered list with bold headers (Deep Breaths, Physical Reset, etc.) that dominates the response. The prose is limited to brief intro/outro paragraphs sandwiching the list. This is the opposite of the ideal flowing paragraph format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural flowing prose: instead of '1. Deep Breaths: Try...' write 'I'd suggest trying some box breathing—breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, and exhale for 4. It really helps me when I'm nervous.'",
      "Add first-person connection throughout: 'I get so nervous before presentations too, and my hands always shake. It's literally just adrenaline trying to help you perform!'",
      "End with a specific engaging question: 'What part of the presentation are you most worried about?' or 'Do you have your notes ready, or are you winging it?'",
      "Move from validation to advice more gradually—spend another sentence on the emotional experience before jumping to 'Here are tips'"
