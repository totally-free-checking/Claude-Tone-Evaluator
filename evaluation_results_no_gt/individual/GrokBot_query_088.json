    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating and hurtful' acknowledging the specific pain of teacher inaction",
      "Natural first-person advice using 'If I were you, I'd maybe...' and 'I think' which creates authentic connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for approaching the teacher ('Hey, what was said earlier really bothered me because it felt racist/sexist...') that a teen could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions rather than one focused follow-up ('What exactly was said...?' and 'how are you feeling...?') which slightly dilutes the conversational flow",
      "Could briefly acknowledge safety concerns about speaking up given the teacher already ignored the incident, though the 'low-key' framing partially addresses this"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses 'I'd say,' 'If I were you,' and 'I think' naturally throughout, creating genuine peer-like connection rather than clinical distance",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - while the questions are relevant, offering two options ('What exactly was said...?' OR 'how are you feeling...?') feels slightly less confident than a single, focused question would",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider combining the two final questions into one integrated question like 'What exactly was said, and how are you feeling about it now?' to maintain the conversational single-thread flow",
      "Could add one brief line acknowledging that approaching the teacher feels risky since they already ignored it, validating that hesitation before giving the script"
