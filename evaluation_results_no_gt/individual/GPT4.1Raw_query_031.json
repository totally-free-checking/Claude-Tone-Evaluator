    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text message",
      "Opens with warm validation ('Oh no, classic accidental like! It happens to the best of us') that normalizes the embarrassing situation immediately",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice about unliking quickly and realistic reassurance about old posts"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question to continue the conversation - ends abruptly with an exclamation point instead of engaging the user",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely (no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - reads as impersonal general advice rather than a supportive friend sharing their perspective",
      "Could better validate the specific anxiety about being caught 'stalking' rather than just the accidental like"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and no structural elements",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of follow-up question and first-person language makes it feel like a broadcast rather than a conversation",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format - single flowing paragraph with no headers, bold text, or list formatting. Reads naturally like a text message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a follow-up question at the end to continue the conversation, such as 'Have you unliked it yet, or are you still deciding what to do?' or 'Do you think they actually noticed?'",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout to create connection: change 'chances are they won't notice' to 'I'd bet they won't even notice' and 'just remember' to 'I always remind myself that'",
      "Consider adding one well-placed emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after 'Oh no' to enhance the warm, casual tone for this embarrassing situation"
