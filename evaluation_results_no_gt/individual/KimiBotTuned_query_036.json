      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'knot-in-your-stomach situation' and 'bad vibes' that normalizes the teen's discomfort",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I’ve been feeling kind of worried because I’ve noticed they ___, and I just want you to be safe'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation with appropriate paragraph breaks"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person bot perspective when giving advice - uses impersonal constructions like 'it usually goes best' and 'Try to keep' instead of 'I think it works best when...' or 'I'd suggest keeping...'",
