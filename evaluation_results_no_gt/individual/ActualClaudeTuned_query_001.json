    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think it feels way worse to you,' 'I'd just own it') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect emoji usage with one well-placed 😅 that enhances the warm, slightly humorous tone without being excessive",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to say ('Yeah, rough morning!') and immediate physical actions (tucking feet under desk)",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include slightly more explicit emotional validation at the very start (e.g., 'I'm so sorry' or 'That panic is so real') before moving to reassurance",
      "The phrase 'little disasters' could potentially feel minimizing to some teens, though the context of leaning into humor makes it appropriate here"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - maintains conversational flow throughout with advice embedded naturally in sentences rather than listed",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one more explicit 'I' statement about relating to the feeling (e.g., 'I know that exact stomach-drop feeling') to deepen first-person connection",
      "Consider starting with slightly stronger validation like 'Ugh, that's the worst!' before the 'Oh no!' to maximize immediate emotional support",
      "The current structure is excellent - maintain this balance of validation-reassurance-advice-question for future responses"
