      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language ('Ugh, that's seriously the worst' and 'Where's the person I know?')",
      "Excellent use of first-person perspective throughout ('If I were in your shoes', 'I'd probably try', 'I kinda miss') creating genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji choice (😅) at the end of an otherwise serious validation paragraph slightly undercuts the emotional weight, though it does convey the awkward frustration of the situation",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the strong first-person conditional language ('If I were in your shoes', 'I'd say') as it creates authentic connection and distinguishes this from generic advice",
      "Consider moving the emoji to after a lighter moment or removing it from the serious validation paragraph to maintain emotional gravity while keeping warmth",
      "The follow-up question is excellent—continue using this specific, binary-choice format that shows you understand the nuance of their situation"
