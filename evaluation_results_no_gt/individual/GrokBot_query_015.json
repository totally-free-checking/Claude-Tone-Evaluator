    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific empathetic language: 'Ugh, that sounds so infuriating – I totally get why you're about to lose it when someone keeps invading your space like that'",
      "Natural first-person conversational language throughout: 'I'd start by talking to them calmly,' 'I really need you to stop,' and 'I totally get' creates authentic connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column",
      "Specific actionable script provided ('Hey, I really need you to stop going through my stuff – it makes me feel like I can't trust you with my privacy') that gives the teen exact words to use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question combines two distinct questions ('What kind of stuff are they messing with the most, and have you tried saying anything to them yet?') which slightly dilutes the conversational focus compared to a single targeted question",
      "Practical advice could briefly acknowledge what to do if the sibling reacts defensively or refuses to stop, normalizing potential setbacks in the boundary-setting process"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational first-person language - the response flows as authentic paragraphs using 'I' statements and casual phrasing ('I'd start,' 'loop in,' 'chill') without any bullet points or corporate structure",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The compound follow-up question at the end, while natural, slightly diverges from the ideal of a single focused question by asking about both the items being touched and previous conversation attempts in one breath",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, perfectly matching the ideal conversational prose format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider separating the final question into a single focused inquiry or leading with the most engaging question first, though the current compound structure does flow conversationally",
      "Add one sentence acknowledging that siblings sometimes push back initially when boundaries are set, validating that this doesn't mean the teen is wrong to enforce their privacy"
