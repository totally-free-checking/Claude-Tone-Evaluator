    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling' and acknowledges the 'weird limbo' of uncertainty",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout like 'If I were you, I'd maybe try' creating personal connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I've been getting a vibe that something's up. Want to talk, or do you need space?'",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include slightly more explicit emotional validation like 'I'm sorry you're dealing with this' before moving to solutions",
      "While appropriate to have no emojis for this topic, a single subtle emoji could enhance warmth without undermining seriousness"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, lists, or over-structuring while embedding practical advice seamlessly within sentences",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person supportive closing language - while it uses 'If I were you,' it misses opportunities for 'I get it,' 'I'm here,' or 'I think' type phrases that deepen the personal connection",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji like 😕 or 😅 after the opening validation to enhance warmth, though the current text-only approach is acceptable for the serious tone",
      "Strengthen the closing by adding first-person supportive language like 'I'm here if you need to talk' before or after the follow-up question",
      "The transition 'Honestly, sometimes people get in a mood' is good, but prefacing with 'I think' or 'In my experience' would reinforce the first-person conversational tone"
