    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with empathetic language like 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'such a gut-punch' that acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Strong first-person language throughout using 'If I were you,' 'I wanna say,' and 'I'm so sorry' creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('Hey, I've been feeling like I mostly hear from people when they need something...') and concrete experiments"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji following 'gut-punch' creates a slight tonal mismatch since the emoji conveys awkwardness/nervousness while the phrase conveys deep hurt, though both fit the situation somewhat"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language use - it sounds exactly like a supportive older sibling texting advice with natural contractions, casual phrasing ('hits you up,' 'wanna'), and personal perspective",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor emoji placement - while using only one emoji is ideal, the choice of 😅 after the intense phrase 'gut-punch' slightly softens the validation of how painful the situation is",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs, no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using first-person conditional advice like 'If I were you' as it feels more personal than impersonal directives",
      "The specific script provided for talking to the safest friend is excellent - keep offering exact phrasing teens can borrow",
      "Consider whether 😅 is the best choice for painful realizations; 😔 or 💙 might validate the hurt more, or no emoji works fine too"
