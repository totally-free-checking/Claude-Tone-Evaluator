    "strengths": [
      "Provides very specific, actionable advice like the 4-4-4 breathing technique and holding a clicker/pen for stability",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question about timing that shows genuine interest in the immediate situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers ('Right now:', 'During your presentation:', 'Mindset shift:') instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal rather than like a supportive friend"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - the specific techniques (deliberate hand shaking, holding objects, breathing pattern) are realistic and immediately actionable for a teen about to present",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting structure - it reads like a self-help article with bold headers and bullet lists rather than a conversational text from a supportive friend",

      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response contains three distinct bullet sections with bold headers. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are in prose form. The advice is delivered entirely through structured lists rather than flowing conversational sentences."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs - instead of 'Here are a few quick things:' followed by lists, try 'I'd suggest trying some deep breathing first - maybe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4. I also find that shaking out my hands deliberately helps release tension...'",
      "Add first-person perspective to create connection - use phrases like 'I used to get nervous before presentations too' or 'I'd say the audience probably can't see the shaking as much as you think' to sound more like a supportive peer rather than an instruction manual",
      "Expand the emotional validation before jumping to solutions - spend a paragraph acknowledging how scary that physical shaking feels and validating that it's normal before offering the 'how to fix it' advice"
