      "Excellent use of first-person language that creates connection ('I think we've all had a cringe moment,' 'I promise it's a lot more common')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use ('Hey, sorry about the mom mix-up...')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - closes with a statement rather than inviting continued conversation",
      "Could more explicitly validate the intensity of 'wanting to disappear' before moving to reassurance"

      "Add a conversational follow-up question at the end such as 'How are you feeling about facing them again?' or 'Has anything this embarrassing happened to you before?'",
      "Consider explicitly acknowledging the 'want to disappear' feeling with something like 'That wanting-to-disappear feeling is so real' before moving to reassurance"
