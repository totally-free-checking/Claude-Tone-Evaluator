    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, such as 'I'm so sorry', 'If I were you', and 'I'd try giving your friend a quick, honest chat', creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides a specific, actionable script the teen can use word-for-word: 'Hey, I noticed you seemed upset when I hung out with [other person]. I didn't mean to make you feel left out, and I'd love to understand what's going on'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji 😅 following 'stomach flips' slightly risks minimizing the seriousness of a friend being angry, though it does capture the nervous/anxious feeling of the situation",
      "The follow-up question combines two queries ('best way to bring it up' versus 'have you already tried'), which borders on being multiple questions at once rather than a single focused inquiry"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or bold text, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting in flowing conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The normalization statement 'most friends have moments where they get a bit jealous' appears slightly early before fully sitting with the user's specific discomfort, though it does serve to reassure",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains perfect conversational flow across four natural paragraphs with absolutely no formatting structures, bullet points, numbered lists, or headers"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider delaying the normalization ('most friends get jealous') by one more sentence to allow the emotional validation to land more deeply before reframing the situation",
      "Split the final either/or question into a single focused query or ensure the 'or' construction feels more like a natural conversational choice rather than multiple questions"
