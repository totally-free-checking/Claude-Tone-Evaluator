    "strengths": [
      "The follow-up question is excellent—specifically asking about context, smile duration, and usual conversation patterns shows genuine interest and invites the teen to share more",
      "Practical advice is realistic and actionable, including a specific script ('Hey, how's your day going?') and the smart suggestion to look for patterns rather than overanalyzing one moment"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers ('**Zoom out:**', '**Look for patterns...:**') makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language—no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it'—making it feel impersonal and instructional rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping to solutions; only 'Totally relatable' acknowledges feelings before immediately shifting to 'Here's a simple way'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end, which is specific, natural, and shows genuine curiosity about the details of their situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting structure—using four bold-headed bullet points that read like an instruction manual rather than natural prose paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response starts with one brief paragraph of prose, then immediately shifts to 'Here's a simple way...' followed by four heavily formatted bullet points with bold headers. This creates a checklist feel rather than conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs—instead of '**Zoom out:** Was it...', try writing 'I'd say first, try to zoom out and notice if it was a quick polite smile or the kind that lingers...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection—use phrases like 'I think the best approach is...', 'I'd probably look for patterns...', or 'I get how easy it is to spiral on this'",
      "Start with more emotional validation before giving advice—spend a sentence or two on 'Ugh, that overthinking spiral is the worst' or 'We've all been there, analyzing every micro-expression' before moving to solutions",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to match the light, crush-related topic and enhance the friendly tone"
