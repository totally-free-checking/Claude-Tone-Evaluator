      "Provides specific, actionable advice including a concrete script the teen could use: 'Hey, I've noticed we only hang out when [other person] is around — I'd love to catch up one-on-one sometimes too.'",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation: 'That's a tough and uncomfortable feeling — I'm sorry you're going through that.'",
      "Ends with affirming validation about deserving reciprocal friendships"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered bullet points with bold headers instead of natural prose paragraphs, reading like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Lacks first-person conversational language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') throughout, making it feel impersonal and detached",
      "Follow-up question 'How are you feeling about all this?' is generic and not specific to their situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific script example for talking to the friend is realistic and immediately actionable",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - uses 'Here are a few thoughts that might help:' followed by 4 numbered bullets with bold headers, which is exactly the structured format to avoid",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses a numbered list with bold headers (1. **Trust your instincts**, etc.) which creates a clinical, article-like structure. The advice should flow as natural sentences within paragraphs rather than as a checklist."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice section as flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd suggest taking a step back to notice if they only text you when they need something...' instead of numbered bullets",
      "Replace the generic closing question with something specific to their situation like 'Have you noticed them acting differently when [that person] isn't around?' or 'What made you start to suspect this?'",
      "Add more casual, conversational interjections throughout like 'Ugh, that's such a gut-punch feeling' or 'Honestly, I've seen this happen before' to increase warmth and first-person connection"
