    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person validation language like 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with that' and 'I think a lot of parents don't realize' which creates personal connection",
      "Perfect prose format with natural conversational flow - uses transitions like 'Honestly' and 'Like' without any bullet points or over-structuring",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to parents: 'I want to do well in school too, but when I feel like anything less than perfect isn't good enough, it makes me more anxious about everything'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the casual, friendly tone at the start",
      "Could include more explicit first-person support closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to strengthen the personal connection beyond just the question"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with ideas flowing naturally through paragraphs rather than lists",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a single warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the beginning to immediately signal the casual, friendly tone",
      "Include an explicit first-person support statement like 'I'm here to help you figure this out' or 'I'm happy to talk through this more' before the question to reinforce that you're personally engaged with their situation"
