    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation comparing the situation to a 'social horror movie' and acknowledging the 'uniquely awful' feeling of being trapped",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice with actual phrases the teen could use like 'This is awkward, huh? Hope you're doing okay'",
      "Ends with a natural, context-specific follow-up question about whether it's a temporary or long-term seating situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers and structured sections (**The 'Professional Acquaintance' approach**) instead of natural prose paragraphs, creating a listicle format",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I'd probably') making it feel impersonal despite casual word choice",
      "Presents advice as detached options rather than personal recommendations from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question is natural, specific to the situation (asking about duration/context), and invites continued conversation",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Uses three bold headers to separate strategies, functioning as a list despite not using bullet symbols. The response is structured as intro → three labeled sections → outro, rather than flowing paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the three approaches as natural prose: 'Honestly, I'd probably gauge your energy level first. If you're feeling drained, I'd go with what I call the professional acquaintance move—just a quick nod and then dive into your phone...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: 'I think acknowledging the elephant in the room can actually help,' or 'I'd say the sleep decoy is your best bet if you're not ready to talk'",
      "Remove all bold headers and let the advice flow naturally within paragraphs without labeling the strategies"
