    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sucks' and acknowledgment that the 'haha just kidding' comments sting, making the teen feel understood right away",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts for what to say ('Hey, I know you're joking, but those comments kinda hurt') including follow-up responses if the friend dismisses the concern",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') specified in the ideal character; uses imperative 'you can' and 'the cleanest move is' instead of sharing personal perspective like 'I'd probably suggest...'",
