    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and describing the 'tense, gross feeling' that captures the emotional experience perfectly",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I'm trying') creating authentic connection and natural conversational flow",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts for both talking to the partner ('Hey, wanna split it up?') and approaching the teacher, making advice immediately usable"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice with 'Honestly, it usually feels way worse than it ends up being' could potentially minimize the teen's anxiety slightly before fully sitting with the emotion",
      "Could include one additional sentence of emotional validation before moving to the practical reframing perspective"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure emotional validation ('That anxiety is totally valid') before the reframing perspective about it feeling worse than it is",
      "The response is exemplary overall - maintain this exact balance of first-person language, specific scripts, and natural paragraph structure for future responses"
