    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging follow-up question ('Do you want to talk about what happened?') that invites the teen to share more",
      "Good balance between emotional validation ('That's really frustrating') and practical next steps"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' statements, making it feel impersonal despite casual tone",
      "Advice is somewhat vague ('talk to a teacher or someone about it') without specific script suggestions for how a teen might advocate for themselves",
      "Could use slightly more warmth upfront - 'That's really frustrating' is good but 'Ugh, that's so unfair' or similar would feel more validating"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - it flows like a real conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language - the response never uses 'I' statements to create personal connection (e.g., 'I think that's so unfair,' 'I'd be upset too,' or 'I'm here to listen')",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person statements to create connection: 'I think that's so unfair' or 'I'd be really frustrated too' instead of impersonal observations",
      "Offer specific phrases the teen could use: 'You could try saying something like, \"I want to understand what I did wrong because I felt the punishment didn't match what happened\"'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😤 or 😅) early in the response to set a supportive tone, or open with more casual validation like 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling'"
