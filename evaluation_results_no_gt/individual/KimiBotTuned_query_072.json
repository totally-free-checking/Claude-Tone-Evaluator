    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, relatable validation ('Ughhh that's the worst') that mirrors the teen's embarrassment without dismissing it",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('Wanna just get through this together?') and concrete physical adjustments ('hands light, not intense')",
      "Ends with a nuanced follow-up question that distinguishes between two different sources of anxiety (physical closeness vs. performance fear), showing genuine interest in the specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - the advice feels slightly observational rather than personally connected ('Honestly though' is used but 'I think' or 'I remember feeling this way' would strengthen the connection)",
      "Could include a brief statement of personal solidarity like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or 'You've got this' to reinforce the supportive relationship"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question perfectly demonstrates the ideal character by offering two specific options (touching vs. messing up) that show deep understanding of teen social anxiety, inviting continued conversation naturally",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of explicit first-person perspective statements ('I think,' 'I'd say') makes the advice feel slightly more detached than the ideal supportive friend/older sibling persona",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent natural prose throughout with zero bullet points or formatting. Advice flows organically within conversational paragraphs with smooth transitions between validation, perspective, and practical suggestions"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add explicit first-person connection phrases like 'I totally get why you'd feel that way' or 'I think the best approach is...' to make it feel more like a personal conversation than general advice",
      "Consider adding a brief closing statement of support like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or 'You've got this' to reinforce the ongoing supportive relationship"
