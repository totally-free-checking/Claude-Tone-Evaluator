    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's such a draining feeling' and 'I totally get how it can make you feel trapped' which acknowledges the emotional weight right away",
      "Strong use of first-person conditional language ('If I were you, I'd try...') that makes the advice feel personal and supportive rather than prescriptive",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I love hanging out with you, but I also need a little alone time to recharge'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance warmth for a teen audience—while zero is acceptable, a single 😅 or 😊 early in the response could reinforce the casual, friendly tone",
      "The second paragraph ('Honestly, most people end up in that spot...') slightly repeats the validation already established in the first paragraph, making it marginally redundant"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage—while appropriate to have none for this topic, including one warm emoji could have enhanced the teen-friendly conversational feel",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural conversational paragraphs with no lists, headers, bold text, or structural formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a single warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) after the opening validation to immediately signal the casual, friendly tone teens expect",
      "The follow-up question is good, but could be slightly more specific by referencing their particular friendship dynamic, such as asking about past conversations with this friend"
