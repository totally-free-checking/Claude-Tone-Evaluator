      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oh no, I'm so sorry… that's such a tough spot to be in' followed by relatability check",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Specific, actionable advice like holding a pen/paper and deep breathing techniques that are realistic for a teen to do right before presenting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section lacks first-person framing - uses impersonal 'Something that might help?' rather than 'I'd suggest' or 'I think'",
      "Ends with two questions at once ('What's the presentation on? Are you feeling ready...') which can feel slightly overwhelming compared to one focused question",
      "Could strengthen personal connection with more 'I've been there' or 'I get it' type language in the advice portion"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to the advice section (e.g., change 'Something that might help?' to 'I'd suggest trying...' or 'I think holding onto something...')",
      "Consolidate the ending into one engaging question rather than two separate ones to keep the conversation focused",
      "Consider adding brief first-person validation like 'I get that feeling' or 'I've definitely been there' to strengthen the personal connection before offering solutions"
