    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think most of us have been there,' 'If I were you, I'd try,' 'That's usually a better clue') which creates genuine connection",
      "Immediate and specific emotional validation with relatable details ('Staring at your phone or replaying conversations, trying to decode every little thing') that shows deep understanding of the teen experience",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than an advice column"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could include one specific example phrase for 'testing the waters' (e.g., suggesting exact wording like 'Want to grab coffee after school Tuesday?') to make it even more actionable",
      "The advice to 'pay attention to how they act' is good but could briefly acknowledge that mixed signals happen and not to overanalyze every interaction"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice specificity - while the suggestions are realistic for teens, they could be slightly more concrete with example scripts or phrases to reduce the ambiguity of 'test the waters'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific example phrase for asking them to hang out (e.g., 'You could try something like, Hey, want to grab boba after school Friday? Just us?') to make the 'test the waters' advice more concrete",
      "Maintain the excellent balance of validation-first structure; the current opening ('Ugh, that in-between feeling is the worst') is exactly the right way to start - keep leading with emotional acknowledgment before solutions"
