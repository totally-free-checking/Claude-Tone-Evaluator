    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation with specific physical descriptions like 'knot-in-your-stomach feeling' and 'emotional tug-of-war' that make the teen feel truly understood",
      "Strong use of first-person language with phrases like 'If I were you, I'd start...' and 'I hear you' that create a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question combines two distinct questions ('How are you feeling about each person right now, and what's the biggest worry...') which can feel slightly overwhelming",
      "Could provide more specific script examples for the 'honest but gentle' conversation with the person they step back from",
      "While good, the advice could include more immediate 'in the moment' strategies for handling the guilt right now"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - maintains perfect paragraph structure without any bullets, headers, or over-formatting while feeling like a real conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The compound follow-up question asks two things at once rather than focusing on one natural, specific question to continue the dialogue",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining a conversational text-message feel throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking the final question into a single focused inquiry rather than asking about feelings AND worries simultaneously - maybe just 'What's the biggest worry you have about moving forward?'",
      "Add 1-2 specific script examples for how to have that 'honest but gentle' conversation, such as 'You could say something like: I really value you as a person, but I need to be honest that I'm not in the right place to date right now'",
      "Could enhance first-person connection even more with phrases like 'I get how that guilt feels' or 'I think you're being harder on yourself than necessary' to deepen the personal bond"
