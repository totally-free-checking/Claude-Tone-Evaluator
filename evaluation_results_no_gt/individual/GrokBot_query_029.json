      "Excellent immediate emotional validation using physical descriptions of embarrassment ('make your face burn and your stomach twist') that shows deep empathy",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I've been there', 'I'd say', 'I felt') creating authentic connection",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact script for approaching the coach ('Hey, I felt kinda embarrassed when you called me out earlier—can we talk about it?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition to reassurance ('most people probably move on from it faster than you think') could potentially feel minimizing to someone in acute embarrassment, though the intent is supportive",
