    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation using 'Ugh' and 'I totally get' to acknowledge the awkwardness before offering any solutions",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts like 'Hey, mind if I join you?' and 'save me a seat?' that a teen could actually use today"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section lacks first-person advisory language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'What I'd do') and instead relies on 'you could' and imperative statements, making it slightly less personal",
      "Third paragraph is quite long and covers many options in one block, which could be broken up for better readability on mobile"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - maintains conversational flow throughout with no over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Impersonal advisory tone in the recommendations section - uses 'try scanning', 'you could grab', and 'sometimes messaging' rather than first-person guidance like 'I think you should scan...' or 'I'd probably message...'",

      "Add first-person advisory language to the recommendations section, such as 'I think you should look for...' or 'If I were you, I'd probably message...' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two smaller paragraphs after the 'save me a seat?' suggestion to improve mobile readability while maintaining the prose format"
