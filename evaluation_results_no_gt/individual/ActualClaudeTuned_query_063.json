    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so awkward!' and 'honestly one of the worst feelings' that acknowledges the specific embarrassment of the situation",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd just', 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Specific, realistic advice tailored to teen social dynamics ('everyone's usually too focused on their own stuff', 'quick \"oops, wrong room!\"')",
      "Engaging, situation-specific follow-up question comparing calculus vs. art class that invites continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice with 'The good news is' could slightly minimize the immediate emotional impact before fully sitting with the feeling",
      "Could acknowledge the 'everyone stared' aspect more specifically before moving to the reassurance that people forget quickly"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining readability",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight rush from emotional validation to logical reframing; could linger on the validating 'We've all been there' energy momentarily longer before introducing 'The good news' perspective",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no formatting structures, bullet points, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more validating sentence about the specific 'staring' aspect before transitioning to 'The good news' to fully honor the embarrassment before reframing",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; this approach of using concrete examples (calculus vs. art) rather than generic 'How are you feeling?' questions is perfect for teen engagement"
