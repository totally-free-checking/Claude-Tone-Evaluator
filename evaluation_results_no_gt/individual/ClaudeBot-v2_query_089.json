    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd pick...', 'I’d do a quick brain-dump') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and the reassurance 'You're not lazy or broken — you're overwhelmed'",
      "Specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (10-minute chunks, brain dump in notes app, permission to submit imperfect work) embedded naturally in prose"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji 😅 following 'heavy' creates a slight tonal mismatch—while it conveys relatability, it may inadvertently minimize the weight of the feeling described",
      "Could benefit from one additional validating sentence before the advice paragraph to further strengthen the emotional support component"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, using first-person perspective ('If I were you...') that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",

      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within conversational sentences rather than being formatted as actionable items."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😟 or 😔 instead of 😅 when acknowledging heavy emotions to better match the emotional weight described",
      "Maintain this level of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') and natural prose formatting in future responses as it creates strong authentic connection"
