      "Opens with immediate, empathetic validation using first-person language ('Ugh, I'm so sorry') and vividly describes the feeling ('your thoughts are doing laps')",
      "Uses specific, teen-relevant actionable advice including 'word-vomit' in notes app, 'doom-scrolling' avoidance, and concrete breathing techniques (4 in, 6 out)",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, reading like a supportive text message",
      "Excellent follow-up question that distinguishes between nighttime and daytime anxiety, showing genuine interest in specifics"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective in the advice section ('I'd suggest...', 'I think...', 'What works for me...'), shifting to imperative commands instead of personal recommendations",
