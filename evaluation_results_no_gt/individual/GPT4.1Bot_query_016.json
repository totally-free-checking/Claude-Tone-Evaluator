    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd just shoot') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's such a stressful feeling' and 'We've all had those moments'",
      "Provides specific actionable script: 'Hey, I totally spaced and made another plan today—sorry about that, is there anything important I'll miss?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one might enhance warmth for this stressful situation (though absence is acceptable)",
      "Follow-up question is slightly lengthy with two questions back-to-back, though they flow naturally"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language usage - consistently uses 'I think', 'I'd say', and 'If I were you' making it feel like advice from a supportive peer rather than an impersonal bot",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Complete absence of emojis; while 0-1 is the ideal range, a single 😅 or 😊 could enhance the warm, casual tone for this relatable teen situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with natural flow between ideas. No headers, bold text, or list formatting used. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than presented as steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one emoji (like 😅) early in the response to match the 'totally spaced' casual energy and enhance warmth",
      "The two-part follow-up question works but could be streamlined to one focused question like 'What's the other thing you planned - is it movable or are you stuck?'"
