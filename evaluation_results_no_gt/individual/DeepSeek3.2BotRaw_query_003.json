    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs that flow like a friend texting - for example, 'If you want to break the ice, I'd probably just start with a simple smile and hey, how've you been? Or you could make a light joke about the situation...'",
      "Always end with a specific follow-up question like 'Do you think you'll try talking to them, or are you hoping to just get through it?' or 'How long do you have to sit there?'",
      "Add first-person connection language like 'I think either approach is totally valid' or 'I'd probably feel awkward too' to make it feel more personal and less like generic advice"
