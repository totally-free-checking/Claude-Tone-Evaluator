      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language ('Ughhh nooo', 'that feeling is the worst', 'makes your whole face go hot instantly') that perfectly captures the embarrassment",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact scripts ('Oh my god, sorry, long day') and concrete behavioral strategies ('act like nothing happened', 'immediately move on to the assignment')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective phrases like 'I think', 'I'd suggest', or 'I get it' which would make it feel more like a personal conversation rather than general advice (only uses 'I'm sorry' in first person)",

      "Incorporate more first-person perspective phrases like 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'In my opinion' to make the advice feel more like personal guidance from a friend rather than general observations",
