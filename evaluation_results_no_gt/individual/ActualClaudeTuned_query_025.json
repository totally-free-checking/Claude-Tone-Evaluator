      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'I totally get why that would feel annoying'",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use: 'Hey mom, I appreciate that you're thinking of me, but I wish you'd asked me first before signing me up'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) slightly mismatches the emotion - suggests nervous laughter/embarrassment rather than frustration at loss of autonomy",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😤 or 😠 instead of 😅 for frustration scenarios, or omit the emoji entirely since the warm tone is already established through words",
      "Could add one more sentence validating the specific feeling of 'it's my schedule and I should have a say' before moving to the 'parents mean well' explanation to strengthen the emotional support"
