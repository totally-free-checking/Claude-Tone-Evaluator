    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that sucks!' and 'makes your stomach flip' that captures the physical cringe feeling of the situation",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—flows like a natural text conversation with 4 well-sized paragraphs",
      "Highly specific practical advice including exact script wording ('Hey, sorry about the random like earlier, was just scrolling') and multiple realistic options (delete, wait it out, or address it)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person singular language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it')—uses imperative 'you could' and 'try' instead of sharing personal perspective like 'I'd probably just delete it and play it cool'",
      "Missing explicit supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar first-person reassurance that creates a personal connection"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero bullet points—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person 'I' language makes the advice feel slightly impersonal despite the warm tone; uses 'you could' directives rather than sharing what 'I would' do in that situation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create stronger connection—instead of 'If you can, try deleting the like,' use 'I'd probably delete the like right away if I were you' or 'I think the best move is...'",
      "Include a brief first-person supportive closing like 'I'm here if you want to talk through it more' to reinforce that this is a personal conversation, not just generic advice"
