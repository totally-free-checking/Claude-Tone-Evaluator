      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh no, that sounds stressful!') that acknowledges the difficulty of setting boundaries",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('Hey [their name], I've been really busy...') and realistic options like muting notifications"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers instead of natural prose (5 numbered items with formatted headers like 'Pause Before Responding')",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel instructional and impersonal rather than conversational"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - it offers concrete, realistic steps and specific wording examples that a teen could actually use immediately",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is structured as 5 numbered bullet points with bold headers (Pause Before Responding, Be Direct and Kind, etc.) plus an intro and conclusion. This is extremely over-formatted for a teen support conversation and feels like a checklist rather than natural prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation, using transitions like 'I think pausing before you respond can really help...' instead of '1. Pause Before Responding'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I'd probably say something like...' or 'I get how overwhelming that feels...' to create the feeling of talking with a supportive friend rather than receiving instructions, and consider combining the two ending questions into one natural follow-up"
