      "No follow-up question at the end to continue the conversation - closes with a statement instead of engagement",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally - instead of 'Here are a few ways:', try 'I think you have a few options depending on your comfort level. If you want to be direct but kind, you could say...'",
      "Add a genuine follow-up question at the end like 'How do you think they'd react if you said something like that?' or 'Have you tried setting boundaries with them before?'",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout like 'I'd probably start with...' or 'I think the logistics excuse works best if...' to make it feel like advice from a person rather than a manual"
