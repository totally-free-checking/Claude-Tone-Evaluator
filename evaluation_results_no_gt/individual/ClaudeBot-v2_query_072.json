    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with first-person empathy: 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'genuinely brutal' acknowledges the specific awkwardness of the situation",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using phrases like 'If I were you, I'd focus'",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact scripts ('I'm kinda nervous about this, so if I mess up sorry in advance') and concrete physical strategies (looking at shoulder instead of eyes)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice ('Honestly though...') could slightly soften the pivot to avoid any hint of minimizing the feeling, though it remains supportive",
      "The paragraph containing advice is slightly dense; breaking into two shorter paragraphs might improve readability on mobile, though it maintains prose format"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow without any bullet points or over-formatting, using first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'If I were you', 'I'd focus')",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward practical advice in the middle section - could use one more brief validating sentence before the 'If I were you' advice section",

      "Consider adding a brief validating bridge between the second and third paragraphs, such as 'I totally get why that feels overwhelming' before shifting to 'If I were you'",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of situational specificity in future responses"
