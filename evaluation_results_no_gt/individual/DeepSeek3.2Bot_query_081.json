    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's so draining') that mirrors how a friend would react",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('Honestly, I think', 'If I were you, I'd try') creating authentic connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable solutions realistic for teens (Do Not Disturb settings, face-down phone) including exact phrasing to use if confronted"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched with the 'exhausted' tone of the query, though it adds warmth",
      "Could include slightly more validation about the frustration of being woken up before moving to the 'friend probably doesn't realize' perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text message from a friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward practical solutions over emotional validation - the validation is strong but brief compared to the advice section",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as conversational paragraphs with no headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase about how frustrating sleep disruption is before offering the perspective that the friend doesn't realize the impact",
      "The emoji works for warmth but 😴 or 💤 might better match the exhaustion theme, or simply omit if the tone feels too light for the situation"
