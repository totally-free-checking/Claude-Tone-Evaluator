      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text message",

      "Appropriate length that covers the topic without overwhelming the reader"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing first-person perspective language in the advice section (no 'I think', 'I'd suggest', or 'I get it') which makes it feel less like a personal conversation",
      "Asks two questions ('Have you talked to them?' and 'Want to chat more?') which slightly dilutes the engagement rather than focusing on one natural follow-up",

      "Add first-person perspective to advice sections, such as 'I think you should...' or 'If I were you, I'd try...' to make it feel more like a supportive friend sharing personal thoughts",
      "Consider offering specific conversation starters like 'Hey, I saw you guys hung out and I felt a bit left out—was that intentional?' to make the advice more actionable",
      "Consolidate to one follow-up question or ensure multiple questions serve distinct purposes without feeling like an interrogation"
