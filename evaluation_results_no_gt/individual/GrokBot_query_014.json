    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you', 'I'd maybe', 'I think') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, you mentioned that thing the other day—did you mean to tell me, or should I pretend I don't know?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural flow—no bullets, headers, or over-structuring, reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly minimizes the feeling with 'it feels way bigger in your head than it probably is' which could come across as dismissive to some teens, though the intent is clearly reassuring",
      "Could benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😅) to enhance the 'awkward spot' validation, though the absence isn't problematic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with embedded first-person advice—uses 'If I were you' and 'I'd say' rather than impersonal directives, making it feel like a real supportive conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question, while good, ends somewhat abruptly with 'blurt it out' and could feel slightly more inviting with softer phrasing like 'or did it just slip out?'",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural paragraphs with zero bullet points, lists, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to visually signal warmth, though the text alone is already quite warm",
      "The phrase 'keeping it zipped' is great casual language, but you might also acknowledge that if the secret is something dangerous or harmful, telling a trusted adult is an option—though this depends on the secret's nature"
