    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd honestly', 'I get that') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and relatable description of the 'awkward guessing game'",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for what to say: 'Hey, I feel like something's off between us. Did I do something wrong?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) slightly mismatched with frustration context - more suited for embarrassment/nervousness than interpersonal conflict",
      "Could include slightly more emotional validation in the second paragraph before jumping to the solution"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with consistent first-person language and conversational flow - perfectly avoids bullet points and over-structuring while maintaining warm, supportive tone",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection (😅) doesn't perfectly align with the emotional context of someone being mad at you; 😕 or 😬 might have been more appropriate for confusion/concern",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is three clean paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or bullet points. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😕 or 😬 instead of 😅 for situations involving interpersonal conflict to better match the emotional tone",
      "Maintain the strong first-person approach throughout - the 'I think' and 'I get that' usage here is exemplary and should be replicated in future responses"
