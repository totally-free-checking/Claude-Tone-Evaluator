    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation acknowledging the humiliation and validating that the feelings are natural",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice including an exact script the teen could use when talking to the coach privately"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points (5 numbered items with bold headers) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and detached"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, actionable steps including specific phrasing for approaching the coach",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - uses extensive bullet points, bold headers, horizontal rules, and blockquotes instead of natural conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'Here are a few thoughts:' followed by 5 numbered bullets with bold headers (**1. It's okay to feel hurt.**), horizontal rules (---), and a blockquote for the suggested script. Only the opening and closing sentences are in prose format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice section as 2-3 flowing paragraphs instead of numbered bullets, using transitions like 'I think it might help to remember...' or 'I'd suggest trying...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout (e.g., 'I get why that would feel humiliating' instead of 'It's natural to feel embarrassed') to create a more personal, supportive connection",
      "Consider using one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to set a casual, friendly tone, and condense the advice to avoid overwhelming the reader"
