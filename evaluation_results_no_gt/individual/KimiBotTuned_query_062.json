    "strengths": [
      "Immediate visceral validation using teen-appropriate language like 'gross' and 'your stomach is screaming nope' that makes the discomfort feel physically understood",
      "Specific actionable scripts ('I'm not doing that,' 'Nah, I'm not comfortable with that') and exit strategies (texting a friend, blaming parents) that are realistic for teens to use in high-pressure moments",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I'm here') which makes the advice feel slightly impersonal rather than coming from a specific supportive individual",
      "The advice paragraph is quite dense and could benefit from being split into two paragraphs for better mobile readability, though it maintains good flow"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting - maintains conversational flow throughout while delivering substantial advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language usage - the response avoids using 'I' statements entirely (no 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk'), making it feel slightly less like a specific person and more like general guidance",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no lists, headers, or bold text. The advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized, perfectly matching the ideal character's conversational style."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person ownership to recommendations, such as changing 'If you can, keep it simple' to 'I'd keep it simple and firm' or 'I think the best approach is' to create a stronger sense of a specific supportive person talking",
      "Consider splitting the long third paragraph after 'change the subject or leave' to create a new paragraph starting with 'If you're stuck in the moment' for better visual breathing room on mobile screens"
