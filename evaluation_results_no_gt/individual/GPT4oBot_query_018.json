      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledgment of the 'heavy, uncomfortable' feeling of being stuck",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with natural transitions between validation and advice",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I just want to say', 'I'm so sorry') creating personal connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions rather than one focused question, which slightly dilutes the engagement",
