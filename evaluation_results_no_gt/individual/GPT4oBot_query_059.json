    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry you're feeling this way' and acknowledging the 'heavy feeling' of putting in effort without reciprocation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use: 'Hey, I feel like I've been the one starting most of our convos lately—do you feel the same way?'",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I'm here to talk it through') creating genuine connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly on the longer side (4 paragraphs) which might be approaching the upper limit for a quick text exchange, though still readable",
      "Could explicitly use 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' before advice to make the first-person perspective even clearer, though the tone remains personal"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, flowing like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured self-help guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up section asks two questions in quick succession ('How do you feel...? Are they engaged...?') which borders on multiple questions at once, though they are closely related",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text (except emphasis asterisks). The response flows naturally through four paragraphs covering validation, normalization, advice, and engagement."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding an explicit 'I think' or 'I'd try' before the advice section to reinforce the first-person conversational stance",
      "The double question at the end could be streamlined into one compound question to avoid overwhelming the user, though the current phrasing is conversational enough"
