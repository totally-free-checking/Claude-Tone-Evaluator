      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using first-person language: 'I'm really sorry you're stuck in that guilt loop—it totally feels heavy'",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for quitting: 'Hey, I've realized I can't keep up with [activity] right now...' including placeholders for personalization",
      "Maintains natural conversational flow throughout with contractions and casual phrasing like 'nagging at you' and 'a lot less dramatic'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is technically compound (two questions joined by 'or'), though it flows naturally as a single conversational thread",
      "Could include slightly more first-person 'I' statements in the reassurance section to strengthen personal connection, though 'If I were you' is well-used"

      "Consider adding one more first-person validation phrase like 'I get how heavy that feels' to reinforce the personal connection",
      "The compound question at the end works well, but could be split into two separate sentences for clarity while maintaining the conversational tone"
