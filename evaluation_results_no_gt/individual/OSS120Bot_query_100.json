      "Immediate emotional validation with vivid, relatable language ('stomach feel like it's doing backflips') that acknowledges the physical feeling of inadequacy",
      "Natural first-person connection throughout ('I've definitely been there', 'If I were you, I'd try') creating a supportive peer-like relationship",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—reads exactly like a supportive text conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one additional explicit first-person statement (like 'I think' or 'I get it') in the advice section to maintain the personal voice established in the opening",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or structural elements, allowing advice to flow organically within conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight underuse of first-person language in the middle advice section compared to the strong opening—relies more on 'If I were you' rather than 'I think' or 'I'd suggest'",

      "Consider adding explicit first-person framing like 'I think' or 'In my experience' before specific suggestions to maintain the personal, supportive voice throughout the entire response",
      "For serious emotional topics like inadequacy, consider using 😊, 💙, or no emoji rather than 😅, which can imply nervous laughter that might slightly undermine the validation of difficult feelings"
