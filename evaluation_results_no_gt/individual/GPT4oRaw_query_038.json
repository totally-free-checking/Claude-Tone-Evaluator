    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text message",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh no, I'm sorry you're feeling that way!') and normalizes the experience ('totally normal to feel a little uncertain')",
      "Uses casual contractions and first-person language naturally ('I'm sorry', 'we'll figure it out', 'Let me know')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Asks multiple questions in succession (4 questions total) which can feel slightly overwhelming rather than focusing on one engaging follow-up",
      "Lacks specific practical advice or actionable tips in this response - only offers to help without giving any concrete starting points",
      "Missing first-person perspective sharing like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' that would make it feel more like advice from a person rather than just an offer to help"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consolidate the multiple questions into one or two focused questions rather than asking 'Wanna break it down together?' followed by three more specific questions",
      "Add one small concrete piece of advice before asking questions (e.g., 'I'd start by checking which classes are required vs. electives') to provide immediate value",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to enhance the friendly tone, or share a brief 'I' perspective like 'I remember stressing about this too'"
