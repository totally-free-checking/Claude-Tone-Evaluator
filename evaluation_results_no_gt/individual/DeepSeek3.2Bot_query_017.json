    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think I'd start,' 'I totally get,' 'I'd avoid') creating genuine connection and conversational warmth",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than an advice column",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact phrasing to use with other friends ('Hey, have you ever gotten a weird feeling from [Boyfriend's Name]?') and concrete observation strategies"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The suggestion to check with another friend could potentially create gossip if not handled carefully; could benefit from a note about keeping it confidential",
      "Could more explicitly validate that the teen doesn't need 'proof' or concrete evidence to trust their gut feelings and set boundaries"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - the response uses paragraph structure exclusively with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting, reading exactly like a supportive older sibling texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The advice to consult another friend, while practical, slightly risks creating drama or gossip circles; a brief note about discretion or confidentiality would strengthen this suggestion",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining conversational rhythm throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding explicit permission that the teen doesn't need concrete evidence or 'proof' to trust their instincts and distance themselves if they feel unsafe",
      "Include a brief note about keeping observations confidential when checking with other friends to avoid creating unnecessary drama or gossip"
