    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with specific, relatable language like 'that kind of comment can just hang in the air and make the whole room feel gross' and validating the feeling of being 'frozen' in the moment",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I think a lot of us would', 'I think you could consider') creating personal connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing ('Hey, I was pretty uncomfortable with that comment earlier') while acknowledging the teen's agency and comfort level"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question 'What class were you in when this happened?' is specific but slightly narrow; a more open-ended question about their feelings or what they need might invite deeper sharing",
      "While it uses 'I think' effectively, it could strengthen the personal connection even more with an explicit 'I'm here if you need to talk' or 'I'd feel the same way' type statement"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and natural paragraph structure - it completely avoids bullet points and lists, allowing advice to flow organically within conversational sentences as if texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question, while present and natural, focuses on factual details (what class) rather than emotional check-in, which could slightly limit the depth of continued support",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice is seamlessly integrated into natural sentences rather than being listed out as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding an explicit supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk more about this' to strengthen the first-person supportive presence",
      "The follow-up question could be broadened slightly to something like 'What class were you in, and how are you feeling about it now?' to balance factual interest with emotional check-in",
      "Maintain the excellent balance of validation-to-advice ratio and the natural use of contractions and casual language like 'super tough' and 'heads-up'"
