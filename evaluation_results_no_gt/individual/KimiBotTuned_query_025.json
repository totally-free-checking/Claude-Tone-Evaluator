      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' and acknowledging feeling 'steamrolled'",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for talking to mom: 'I know you were trying to help, but I really need you to ask me before signing me up for stuff'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' that builds personal connection",
