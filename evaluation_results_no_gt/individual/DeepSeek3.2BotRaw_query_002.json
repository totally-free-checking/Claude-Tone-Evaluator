    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Oh man, that's the worst feeling' and 'Been there!' which creates instant rapport",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to say like 'I completely forgot to bring it. Can I turn it in tomorrow?'",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that invites continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered bullet points and bold formatting ('1. **Just be honest**') instead of conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person perspective throughout - uses impersonal 'Here are options' and 'Most teachers appreciate' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest'",
      "Emotional validation is brief (one sentence) while structured advice dominates the response"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic scripts a teen can actually use immediately with their teacher",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses 'Here are a few quick options' followed by a numbered list with bold headers, reading like a checklist rather than a conversation",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses a numbered list with bold headers (1. **Just be honest**) which creates a structured, listicle format. Only the opening sentence and final question are in prose, making it feel more like a wikiHow article than a supportive text from a friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as flowing prose paragraphs instead of numbered bullets - for example, 'I'd probably just be honest and say something like...' rather than '1. Just be honest'",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'In my experience') to create a personal connection rather than impersonal generalizations",
      "Extend the emotional validation section slightly before jumping to solutions to better balance support with advice"
