    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation that liking two people is common and doesn't make them a bad person",
      "Practical advice is specific and psychologically insightful, particularly the point about figuring out what each person represents (comfort vs. excitement)",
      "Advice is realistic for a teen's agency and situation, focusing on honesty and boundaries rather than abstract morality"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person language (no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which creates emotional distance",
      "Asks three questions at once which feels interrogative rather than inviting, and uses numbered list format instead of natural prose"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific guidance about separating feelings from actions and identifying what each crush represents shows genuine understanding of teen relationship dynamics",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - the response uses 5 bullet points with bold headers and reads as a structured list rather than warm, flowing conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response starts with one paragraph of prose but immediately transitions to 'A few things to help you sort it out:' followed by 5 heavily formatted bullets with bold headers. Ends with 3 numbered questions. Reads like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive text."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd probably start by asking myself...' or 'I think it helps to separate feelings from actions...'",
      "Reduce the three numbered questions to one natural follow-up like 'Are you actually dating either of them, or is this just crush territory?'",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) or more empathetic phrasing like 'Ugh, that guilty feeling is honestly the worst' to increase warmth"
