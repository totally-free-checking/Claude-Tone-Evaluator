    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get why it's draining', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'I think most people reach a point') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'Sorry, I'm trying to stick to my own work this time. I can help explain the material if you want to work on it together, though?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could more explicitly validate the 'tired' and frustrated aspect of the user's specific emotional state (focuses more on the awkwardness)",
      "The follow-up question assumes past hesitation rather than leaving room for this being a first-time boundary setting, though this is minor"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "The emoji choice (😅) slightly emphasizes awkwardness over the frustration/tiredness the user expressed, though it still fits the 'awkward position' framing",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider matching the energy of 'tired of it' with slightly stronger validation of frustration/exhaustion before moving to the awkwardness aspect",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more open-ended like 'Have you tried saying no before, or is this the first time you're thinking about setting that boundary?' to avoid assumptions"
