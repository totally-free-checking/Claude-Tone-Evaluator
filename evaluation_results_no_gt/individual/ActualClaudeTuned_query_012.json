    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I get why', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'hits you right in the gut' that directly addresses the teen's embarrassment"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could be more specific - suggests 'try talking to them more' but doesn't offer concrete conversation starters or examples",
      "The phrase 'Try not to read too much into it' risks minimizing feelings despite being preceded by validation, could soften with 'I know it's hard not to...'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullets and consistent first-person conversational voice that sounds like a supportive friend texting",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "When suggesting they talk to their crush, include one specific conversation starter example (like commenting on a class or shared interest) to make the advice more actionable",
      "Consider softening the 'don't read too much into it' line with acknowledgment of difficulty like 'I know it's nearly impossible not to overthink, but...' to maintain validation while offering perspective"
