    "strengths": [
      "Strong first-person validation with phrases like 'We've all been there' and 'I totally get why you're feeling weird about it' which creates genuine connection",
      "Natural conversational language using teen-appropriate phrases like 'hits different' and 'the worst' without sounding forced"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bulleted list for advice options instead of flowing prose, which breaks the conversational text-message style ('Delete it if that's possible', 'Edit it if the platform allows', etc.)",
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance the warm, commiserating tone appropriate for this casual social media regret scenario"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language usage - uses 'I totally get' and 'we've all been there' to feel like a supportive peer rather than an authority figure",

      "notes": "Response contains one prominent bulleted list with 4 items in the middle of the text, breaking the conversational flow. The advice should be woven into sentences rather than listed."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose: 'Depending on what you posted and where, you could delete it if the platform allows, or maybe edit it. Sometimes a quick follow-up clarification works, or honestly just letting it ride is the best move - most people scroll past stuff pretty fast anyway.'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the start (like 😅 or 😬) to match the 'Oh no' energy and enhance the empathetic tone",
      "The follow-up question is good but could be slightly more specific: instead of 'what's bugging you about it?' try 'what part of it is making you cringe the most?' or 'was it something personal or more of a hot take?'"
