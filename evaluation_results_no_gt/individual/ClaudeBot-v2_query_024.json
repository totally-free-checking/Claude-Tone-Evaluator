    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with highly relatable physical description ('punch to the stomach') that captures the specific anxiety of being left out",
      "Excellent use of first-person perspective throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I totally get') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for the conversation including exact wording a teen could use",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji following the 'punch to the stomach' description slightly conflicts with the severity of the emotional pain described, potentially minimizing the feeling",
      "Could benefit from one explicit 'I'm here to talk more' type statement before the question to reinforce ongoing support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any structured lists or headers",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice placement immediately after describing emotional pain, which slightly undercuts the validation though remains within acceptable teen communication styles",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, bold text, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider moving the emoji to after the normalization sentence rather than the pain description, or using 😊 or 💙 to maintain warmth without minimizing the hurt",
      "Add one brief 'I'm here if you need to talk more' or similar closing before the question to explicitly offer continued support"
