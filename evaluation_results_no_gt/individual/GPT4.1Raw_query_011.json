    "strengths": [
      "Uses pure natural prose with zero bullet points, creating a conversational flow that feels like texting",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I've noticed you copy me a lot, and honestly, it's starting to bother me'",
      "Ends with a thoughtful follow-up question that gives the user agency to choose between advice or venting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel more like generic advice than a personal conversation",
      "Validation could be warmer and more casual - 'That sounds really frustrating' is polite but lacks the 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' energy a friend would have",
      "Explains the psychology behind the friend's behavior ('Sometimes people do this because they admire you') which feels slightly clinical and detached"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language and conversational warmth - reads like general advice rather than a supportive friend texting",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to create personal connection - instead of 'Sometimes just mentioning it can help,' try 'I'd suggest just mentioning it'",
      "Open with more casual, relatable validation like 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' or 'We've all been there' instead of the more formal 'That sounds really frustrating'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji like 😅 or 😤 early in the response to match the casual, friendly tone"
