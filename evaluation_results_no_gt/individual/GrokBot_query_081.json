    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I think', 'I totally get') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing ('Hey, love the snaps but 2am ones are killing my sleep...') and app-specific solutions",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) slightly mismatches the exhaustion theme - suggests awkward laughter rather than tiredness",
      "Could add one more brief validating phrase in the advice section to maintain emotional warmth while transitioning to practical steps"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with consistent first-person conversational language - reads like a real person texting rather than an AI or article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection doesn't perfectly align with the 'exhausted' feeling described in the query",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no formatting, lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😴 or 😩 instead of 😅 to better match the exhaustion/sleep deprivation theme",
      "Add a brief validating bridge between the validation and advice sections, such as 'You deserve uninterrupted sleep, so here's what I'd try:' to maintain warmth throughout"
