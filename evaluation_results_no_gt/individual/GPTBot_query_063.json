    "strengths": [
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts for exactly what to say in the moment ('Sorry—wrong room,' small nod, leave)",
      "Ends with a highly contextual follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specific situation (lecture vs. small class vs. exam)",
      "Reframes the situation helpfully by explaining that people stare because a door breaks focus, not because they judge you"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points (3 items) makes it read like an instruction manual rather than a conversational text from a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') which creates emotional distance rather than connection",
      "Could open with stronger emotional validation—while 'painfully relatable' is good, it misses the opportunity to say 'I've totally done this' or 'That sinking feeling is the worst'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality—offers concrete, realistic scripts for exactly what to say in multiple scenarios (wrong room entirely vs. wrong section)",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting—the response relies on a structured bullet list for the core advice rather than flowing conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "The response uses 'here are a few low-drama saves:' to introduce a 3-item bullet list that comprises the majority of the advice. This creates a self-help article format rather than natural texting flow. The bullets contain good content but should be woven into narrative sentences."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points to flowing prose: 'If it happens again, I'd just glance at the board and say something like, \"Sorry—wrong room\" with a small nod before leaving. If you're not totally sure, you could ask, \"Is this [class name]?\" and if they say no, just say \"Thanks!\" and bounce.'",
      "Add first-person connection throughout: 'I know that stomach-drop feeling—I've walked into the wrong room before and it's mortifying,' or 'I'd say the best thing you can do right now is...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after 'Oof' to match the casual, empathetic tone of the opening"
