      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use in the moment (e.g., 'I'm here to get the work done. Can we keep it respectful?')",
      "Addresses multiple severity levels of the situation, from awkward avoidance to actual bullying, showing nuanced understanding",
      "The follow-up questions are specific to the situation rather than generic, asking about assignment length and specific behaviors"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with numbered headers (### 1, ### 2, etc.) and bullet points throughout, reading like a wikiHow article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal instructional tone throughout",
      "Minimal emotional validation upfront ('Oof, that's rough') immediately followed by 'you've basically got two goals' - jumps straight to problem-solving without making the teen feel heard",
      "Uses markdown formatting (### headers, bullet lists) that feels clinical and formal rather than like texting a friend"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the suggestions are realistic, specific to teen social dynamics, and include actual scripts they can use",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response is almost entirely structured as numbered lists with sub-bullets, completely violating the conversational paragraph format",

      "bullet_count": 15,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Uses 5 main numbered sections with markdown headers (###), multiple sub-bullets under each, and ends with 3 additional bullet-pointed questions. Only 1-2 sentences at the beginning are in prose format."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as 2-3 flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd probably try to keep it strictly business...' or 'I think the best thing you can do is...' instead of numbered instructions",
      "Add genuine emotional validation before any advice - expand on 'Oof' with something like 'That sinking feeling when you see the partner assignment is the worst. I'm so sorry you're dealing with that.'",
      "Remove all markdown headers (###) and bullet points. If you need to separate ideas, use natural transitions like 'Another thing that might help...' or 'If that doesn't work...'",
      "Convert the final questions into natural prose: 'If you want to talk through this more, I'm curious - what exactly have they done that makes you think they hate you? And is this a quick one-day thing or a longer project?'"
