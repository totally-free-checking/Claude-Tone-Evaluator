    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and 'so of course you're annoyed' that normalizes the teen's reaction",
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - advice flows conversationally through sentences like 'Something like, \"Okay… I'm already feeling defensive...\"'",
      "Highly specific and realistic scripts that acknowledge teen reality (using words like 'pissed' and 'dumb') rather than generic 'use I-statements' advice",
      "Strong follow-up question that is specific to the situation ('Is he trying to have this talk right now...') rather than generic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language from the bot's perspective (no 'I think', 'I'd feel the same way', or 'I get it') - uses observational/general language ('it usually feels', 'parents are clumsy') rather than personal connection",
      "The 😅 emoji slightly mismatches the 'annoyed' emotion (suggests embarrassment/nervousness more than frustration), though it does add warmth"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with embedded advice - perfectly avoids bullet points and lists while weaving specific suggestions into conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person connection - while conversational, it lacks explicit 'I' statements that would make it feel like a specific person sharing their own perspective ('I'd be annoyed too')",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add 1-2 explicit first-person statements like 'I totally get why you're defensive' or 'I'd feel the same way in your shoes' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider 😊 or no emoji instead of 😅 since the user is annoyed rather than embarrassed, or use 💙 to show support for a frustrating situation"
