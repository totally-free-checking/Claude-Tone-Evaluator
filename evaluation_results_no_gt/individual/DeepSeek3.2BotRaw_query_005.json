      "Provides concrete, realistic advice that teens can actually implement (e.g., 'Documenting what's happening can also help', 'Talk to close friends or someone you feel safe with')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on 7 numbered bullet points with bold headers makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal instructional tone throughout ('Consider the source', 'Avoid fueling it')",
      "Follow-up question is generic and feels tacked on rather than naturally engaging ('Is there anything specific...')"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - the suggestions are specific, actionable, and realistic for a teen's level of agency (ignoring low-stakes rumors, talking to trusted friends, documenting harassment)",

      "notes": "Response is structured as an intro sentence, 7 numbered bullet points with bold subheaders, and a closing paragraph. This is extremely over-formatted and reads like a self-help guide or school pamphlet rather than a text conversation. The advice is delivered as a checklist rather than flowing naturally in prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the 7 bullet points into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of '1. Stay calm... 2. Consider the source...' write something like 'I'd probably start by just taking a breath and not reacting right away, since they might be looking for drama. Then maybe think about how big this actually is - if it's just a few people, sometimes ignoring it works better...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - use phrases like 'I think the best approach would be...', 'I'd say focus on...', or 'I get how unfair this feels' instead of impersonal directives",
      "Replace the generic closing question with something specific and warm like 'Who started it - someone you used to be close with, or more of a random person? That might change how you want to handle it'"
