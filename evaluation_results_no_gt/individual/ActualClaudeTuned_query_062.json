    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so tough!' and acknowledging the confusion/stress of friend pressure",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think it's completely okay', 'I'd stick to your gut') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can use ('I'm just not comfortable with that', 'That's not really my thing')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is technically two questions joined together, which slightly dilutes the focus",
      "Could potentially add one more layer of validation explicitly normalizing that friendships sometimes end over boundary violations"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and conversational flow that reads like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question combines two inquiries ('What kind of thing... and how are they reacting...') which slightly complicates the engagement",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or structured formatting. Uses natural paragraph breaks that follow conversational logic."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the strong first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say') as it creates essential warmth and personal connection",
      "Consider keeping follow-up questions to a single focused inquiry rather than compound questions to make it easier for the teen to respond",
      "The balance of validation-to-advice ratio is excellent - approximately 25% validation, 60% advice, 15% engagement"
