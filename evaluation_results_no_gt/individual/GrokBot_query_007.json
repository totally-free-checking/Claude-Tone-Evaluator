    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' and 'I totally get that sinking feeling' that acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd shoot your partner a quick message', 'I haven't seen your part yet') creating authentic connection",
      "Specific, actionable scripts for both texting the partner and approaching the teacher, giving exact words to use in a difficult conversation",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 😅) to enhance warmth, though the absence is understandable given the stress context",
      "The transition to 'the good news is teachers usually pick up on who's pulling their weight' could slightly minimize the immediate panic of the tomorrow deadline"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person perspective ('I'd shoot', 'I get', 'If I were you') that creates genuine peer-like support rather than robotic instruction",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Complete absence of emojis, while appropriate for the stress level, misses a subtle opportunity to add visual warmth that could enhance the supportive tone",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no structural formatting, headers, or lists. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs using phrases like 'If I were you' rather than bullet points or numbered steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😬 or 😅) early in the response to soften the 'Ugh' opening while maintaining the stressed tone",
      "The follow-up question 'What parts of the project have you already knocked out?' is excellent - continue using specific, situation-relevant questions rather than generic 'How are you feeling?' questions"
