    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I hear you', 'I'd maybe consider')",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation that names specific feelings ('powerless and disrespected') before offering any solutions",
      "Provides concrete, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I feel really upset and disrespected when you go through my things without asking')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😔 emoji, while appropriate for the serious topic, is slightly somber; a 💙 or 😤 might match the 'about to lose it' energy slightly better",
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother with a phrase like 'Here's what I'd try' rather than jumping straight into 'If I were you'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural elements - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Nothing significantly diverges; if forced to choose, the emoji choice is the only minor mismatch with the user's expressed anger (uses sad face instead of frustrated face)",

    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain this excellent balance of first-person language ('I'd say', 'I think') which makes the advice feel personal rather than prescriptive",
      "Consider matching the emoji to the specific emotion expressed - since they said 'about to lose it,' a 😤 or 💢 might resonate more than 😔, or simply omit the emoji for serious privacy violations",
      "The follow-up question about parents vs. handling it alone is excellent - continue asking specific situational questions that help you understand their context better"
