    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get why you're upset', 'I'd maybe wait', 'I think') creating genuine personal connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation between friends",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and acknowledging 'it still sucks to have your freedom taken away'",
      "Specific, realistic advice for teen agency including exact phrasing suggestions ('ask them to explain exactly what you did wrong') and acknowledging when to 'ride it out'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) conveys nervous laughter/awkwardness which slightly mismatches the serious frustration of unfair punishment; 😊 or 😔 would better enhance warmth",
      "Could strengthen validation by explicitly acknowledging that parents sometimes are actually unfair rather than framing it only as a perception mismatch ('when it feels like' vs validating the unfairness as real)",
      "Advice section could offer one concrete script example for opening the conversation rather than general approach"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose paragraph structure with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection (😅) is slightly incongruous with the emotional weight of being grounded unfairly; while within the 0-1 limit, it creates a 'nervous chuckle' vibe rather than warm solidarity",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is composed of three clean paragraphs with no formatting artifacts, lists, or structural elements. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider replacing 😅 with 😊 or 💙 to better match the supportive warmth needed for unfair punishment scenarios, or omit entirely if the situation feels serious",
      "Add one specific conversation starter script such as 'Hey, can we talk about the grounding? I want to understand better...' to make the advice even more actionable",
      "Consider validating that parents can actually be unfair sometimes (not just 'feel' unfair) to strengthen the 'I get it' factor for teens in unjust situations"
