    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation ('Ugh, this is honestly one of the most stressful social puzzles') that acknowledges the difficulty and stress of the situation",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice teens can actually use (remembering 'weird specific details,' 'laugh just a little too hard,' 'hold eye contact a beat longer,' 'playful teasing') rather than vague platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers ('**The extra factor**', '**Body language breadcrumbs**', etc.) that function as bullet points, creating a listicle format instead of natural flowing prose",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') - reads like an impersonal article ('Here are a few things,' 'Those are usually') rather than a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic strategies specific to teen social dynamics with thoughtful caveats about cultural differences and power imbalances",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and prose formatting - the response uses zero first-person connection and relies on bold headers/structured sections instead of natural paragraph flow, making it feel like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "While the content under each section is written in prose paragraphs, the use of four bold headers ('The extra factor', 'Body language breadcrumbs', 'The jealousy test', 'But honestly?') creates a heavily structured, list-like format that diverges from the ideal conversational paragraph style"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite without bold headers - integrate the advice into natural flowing paragraphs that transition smoothly from one idea to the next, like texting a friend",
      "Add first-person language throughout: instead of 'Here are a few things,' try 'I think the key things to watch for are...' and instead of 'Those are usually green flags,' try 'I'd say those are usually green flags'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 😊) to enhance the casual, friendly tone"
