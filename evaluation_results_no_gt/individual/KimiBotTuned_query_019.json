    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with visceral language like 'gross feeling' and 'makes your stomach twist' that authentically captures the teen's physical and emotional experience",
      "Highly specific practical advice including exact script wording ('I understand why this looks suspicious...') and concrete evidence strategies (scratch work, timestamps, explaining problems out loud) that are immediately actionable",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers, reading like a supportive text message"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language from the bot's perspective (no 'I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it', or 'I'm here for you'), making the support feel slightly detached despite the warm tone",
      "Uses imperative/command structure ('ask to talk to your teacher', 'keep it super straightforward', 'offer anything you have') rather than collaborative first-person suggestions that would create a stronger sense of shared problem-solving"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - it provides specific, realistic scripts and evidence-gathering strategies tailored to a teen's actual capabilities and school context, avoiding generic platitudes",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The conversational tone's lack of first-person connection - the response completely avoids using 'I' statements to share the bot's perspective or offer personal solidarity, reading more like an instructional guide than a supportive friend saying 'I've got your back'",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent natural prose throughout with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or over-formatting. Advice flows organically within conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person supportive language like 'I'd suggest asking...' or 'I think the best approach would be...' instead of imperative commands to create more of a personal, supportive connection",
      "Include a brief closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk through this more' or 'You've got this' to establish the bot's presence and emotional investment",
      "Consider whether 😅 fully matches the seriousness of a cheating accusation - while it captures awkwardness, the response acknowledges it's 'scary,' so 💙 or simply no emoji might better align with the emotional weight described"
