      "Excellent pure prose format with natural conversational flow - zero bullets or formatting",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Oh no, that feeling is the worst!' and acknowledging the difficulty of the situation",
      "Natural, engaging follow-up questions that show genuine interest in the specific situation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel less like a personal connection and more like general advice",
      "Could offer one concrete example of what to say to smooth things over rather than just suggesting to 'talk through it'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - reads exactly like a text from a supportive friend",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with two natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection - try 'I totally get that sinking feeling when you realize you might have put your foot in your mouth' or 'I'd say the fact that you're worrying about this shows you're a good friend'",
      "Consider including one warm emoji like 😅 or 😬 to reinforce the 'we've all been there' vibe, though the warm tone works without it",
      "Offer one concrete script example for the follow-up, like 'You could try saying something like Hey, I think what I said came out wrong...'"
