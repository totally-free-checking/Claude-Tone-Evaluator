    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('I'm so sorry - that's honestly the worst feeling!') and acknowledges the betrayal aspect of the situation",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I'd start by letting them know,' 'I know it feels like a bit of a betrayal') creating a personal, supportive voice",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I noticed my [item] came back pretty damaged. What happened?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include slightly more emotional validation in the middle section before jumping to the practical steps",
