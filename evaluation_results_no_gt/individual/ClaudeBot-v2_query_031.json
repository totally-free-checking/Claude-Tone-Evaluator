    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'd be spiraling too', 'I'd probably just leave it alone', 'I'd switch to viewing') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation between friends",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with specific relatable language ('stomach drop moment', 'you're not being dramatic')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question is slightly compound (asking two things at once: 'Did you unlike it fast, and is this someone...') which could feel slightly less focused than a single question",
      "Balance leans slightly toward practical advice over emotional validation, though it does start with strong validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person perspective that sounds like a supportive friend texting",

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

      "Consider focusing the follow-up question to one specific angle (either the unliking speed OR the relationship type) for deeper engagement",
      "The balance is good but could start with one more sentence of pure validation before moving to the 'Honestly though' reassurance paragraph"
