    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I totally get how overwhelming it gets', 'I promise') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's honestly the worst' and normalization with 'you're definitely not alone' before offering any advice",
      "Specific, teen-realistic actionable advice (splashing water, screen breaks, hydration) rather than vague platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The practical advice section uses a slightly list-like structure within the prose ('maybe... or... or...') which could flow slightly more naturally as separate sentences",
      "The follow-up question combines two options in one ('specific thing or everything piling up') which is natural conversation but slightly less open-ended than a single focused question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and consistent first-person conversational voice ('I totally get', 'I'd try', 'I promise') that reads like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother; the 'If I were you, I'd try...' is excellent but the subsequent advice items feel slightly enumerated within the paragraph",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The response uses natural paragraph breaks that follow conversational logic rather than structural formatting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the strong first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say') as it creates authentic connection; avoid drifting into impersonal 'One should' or 'The best approach is' language",
      "Consider varying sentence structure in the advice section to avoid the 'maybe X, or Y, or Z' pattern which can feel slightly list-like even in prose",
      "The emoji usage is perfect at 0-1; keep this restraint and avoid adding more even in longer responses"
