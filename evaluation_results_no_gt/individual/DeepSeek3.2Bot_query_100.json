    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate visceral validation using phrases like 'That feeling can be so heavy and exhausting' and casual empathy 'It really does suck,' making the teen feel instantly understood",
      "Consistently employs natural first-person language throughout ('Honestly, I think,' 'If I were you,' 'our plates') creating an authentic supportive friend dynamic rather than an impersonal advisor",
      "Maintains pure conversational prose format with zero bullet points, allowing practical advice to flow naturally within sentences like 'It might help to think of one small thing you did today'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Absence of emoji usage, while appropriate for the heavy emotional topic, misses an opportunity to add visual warmth (like 💙 or 😊) that could enhance the supportive tone",
      "Could extend the initial validation phase by one sentence before transitioning to 'Honestly, I think' to ensure the teen feels fully emotionally held before receiving perspective"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle supportive emoji early in the response (such as 💙 or 😔) to visually signal warmth, though this is optional for heavier emotional topics",
      "The reflection prompt 'whose enough am I trying to meet' is excellent; consider following up with one more validating statement after the advice section to bookend the support before the final question"
