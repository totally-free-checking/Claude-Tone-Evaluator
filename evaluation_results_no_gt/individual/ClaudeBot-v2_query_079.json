    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('I'm so sorry', 'If I were you, I'd start', 'Honestly, you're not alone')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen agency (sitting with one safe person, bringing easy foods like granola bars, gradual exposure with 'tiny goals')",
      "Exceptional follow-up question that digs into the specific nature of the anxiety (judgment vs. physical sensation of being watched) rather than generic 'how are you feeling'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Zero emojis used, which is appropriate for the topic's seriousness, though a single warm emoji like 😊 or 💙 could enhance the opening without undermining the gravity",
      "The third paragraph containing all the advice is slightly dense; breaking it into two paragraphs might improve readability on mobile"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - it flows exactly like a conversational text from a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of emoji when one subtle warm emoji could enhance the opening validation, though this is minor given the topic's sensitive nature",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as three natural prose paragraphs with no lists, headers, bold text, or structural formatting. Advice is seamlessly woven into conversational sentences rather than presented as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😊 or 💙) after the opening validation to enhance warmth, though only if it feels natural for the tone",
      "The advice paragraph could be split after '...build up over time;' to create a fourth paragraph, making it even more readable on phone screens while maintaining the prose format"
