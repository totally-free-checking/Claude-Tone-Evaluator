    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable language like 'that sting' and 'gut-punch' that acknowledges the physical feeling of regret",
      "Maintains perfect prose format throughout with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice tailored to teen digital life: checking edit/delete functions, posting follow-up comments, and the 'sorry, posted too soon' script"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could strengthen first-person perspective with explicit 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' statements in the advice section rather than implied perspective",
      "The closing question combines two queries ('What's the post about, and are you thinking...') which is slightly complex though still conversational"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add explicit first-person framing to advice statements, such as 'I'd probably check if the platform lets you edit...' or 'I think posting a brief follow-up works well...' to strengthen the supportive friend persona",
      "Consider simplifying the closing question to a single focus, such as 'Are you leaning toward fixing it or just waiting for the feeling to pass?' to maintain the conversational flow while reducing cognitive load"
