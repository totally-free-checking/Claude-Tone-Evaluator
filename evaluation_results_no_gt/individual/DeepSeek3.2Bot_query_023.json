    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout with natural usage of 'I think', 'If I were you', 'I might try', and 'Sometimes I find' creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows as natural conversational paragraphs that read like texting a supportive friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation starting with 'I'm so sorry' and physical empathy ('make your stomach feel so heavy') before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji placement after 'it's the worst' slightly mismatches the intensity of the emotional validation, though it works for the awkwardness aspect",
      "Follow-up question focuses narrowly on distraction tactics rather than opening broader emotional connection, though appropriate for the immediate situation",
      "Could slightly expand validation that sitting alone is socially okay, not just physically manageable"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and excellent first-person conversational language ('Honestly, I think', 'If I were you') that creates authentic peer-like support",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question is somewhat transactional (focusing on distraction tools) rather than emotionally deepening the conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider placing the emoji after a sentence about awkwardness rather than after 'it's the worst' to better match emotional tone, or omit entirely",
      "The follow-up question could invite more emotional sharing with something like 'What usually helps you feel better when you're stuck in tough moments like this?' to deepen connection",
      "Maintain the excellent first-person usage - the 'If I were you' and 'Sometimes I find' phrasing is exactly the right level of personal sharing for this character"
