    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads as a natural conversational paragraph",
      "Uses first-person language naturally with 'I'm really sorry' and 'we can' which creates personal connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Response is too brief (only 3 sentences) for the emotional weight of feeling used by a friend - feels somewhat dismissive",
      "Uses clinical language like 'brainstorm' and 'clarify things' which feels more like a therapy intake form than a friend texting",
      "Does not end with a question - the question appears in the middle but the response closes with a statement about brainstorming, missing the opportunity to re-engage",
      "Offers no concrete practical advice in the response, only vague offers to help later ('we can brainstorm')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with no bullet points or over-structuring",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, or bold text. However, the paragraph is extremely short and underdeveloped for the emotional complexity of the situation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand the response to 2-4 paragraphs with more specific validation about how hurtful and confusing it feels to suspect a friend is using you",
      "Replace clinical terms like 'brainstorm' and 'clarify things' with more casual language like 'figure out' or 'sort through this'",
      "Provide at least one concrete piece of advice or perspective before asking for more details - don't make the teen do all the emotional labor first",
      "Ensure the response ends with a specific, engaging question rather than closing with an offer to help later"
