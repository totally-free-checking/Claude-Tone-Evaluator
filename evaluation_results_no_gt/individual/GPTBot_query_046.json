      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can use like 'I can't help with that right now, but I hope it goes okay' and 'I've been feeling like we mostly talk when you need something'",
      "Asks targeted follow-up questions about whether this involves one friend or the group and how they respond to boundaries"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points (5 bullets with bold headers) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - uses impersonal 'you can' statements instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think'",
      "Minimal emotional validation (only 2 sentences) before immediately jumping to practical solutions",
      "Uses bold formatting within text (**one friend**, **most of your group**) which feels structured and formal"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, specific strategies with exact phrasing a teen could use",

      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response relies heavily on formatted bullet points with bold headers (e.g., '**Check the pattern gently.**') and action-oriented lists. The only prose is the brief opening validation and final question, making it feel like a wikiHow article rather than a text from a supportive friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of listing 'Check the pattern gently,' write something like 'I'd maybe start by looking at the last few times you talked...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get why that hurts' to create a personal connection rather than instructional distance",
      "Expand the emotional validation section before giving advice - sit with the feeling of being used longer before offering solutions",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to soften the clinical tone",
      "Consolidate the final two questions into one natural question rather than asking about both the friend count and their response to boundaries simultaneously"
