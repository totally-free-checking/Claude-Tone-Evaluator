    "strengths": [
      "Provides specific, actionable advice with realistic scripts like 'Yeah, it's a limited edition' that a teen could actually use",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging question about the shoe types that shows genuine interest in the specific situation",
      "Maintains appropriate length - concise enough to read quickly on a phone but substantial enough to be helpful"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points for the main advice section ('If you want a low-drama fix:' followed by three bullets) instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Lacks emotional validation for the embarrassment/anxiety of the situation - jumps immediately to solutions without 'Ugh that's mortifying' or 'We've all been there'",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel instructional rather than like a supportive friend"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic solutions specific to the teen's limited options (tucking feet under desk, specific comeback lines)",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - relies heavily on structured bullet lists rather than conversational paragraph flow",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses a header 'If you want a low-drama fix:' followed by three distinct bullet points. The advice is formatted as a checklist rather than flowing naturally within sentences. Only the opening line and closing question are in prose format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs - instead of listing options, flow them together conversationally like 'If you've got time, I'd say dash to your locker real quick. If not, honestly just tuck your feet under the desk - most people won't notice unless you point it out.'",
      "Add emotional validation before giving advice - start with something like 'Oh no, that's such a cringe moment! 😅 But honestly, we've all been there with the morning rush.'",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout to sound more supportive and personal - use phrases like 'I think the best move is...' or 'I'd probably just own it with humor...' instead of impersonal directives"
