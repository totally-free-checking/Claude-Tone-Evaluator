      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I hear you', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'I get that you're stuck, but I can't keep doing the work for you – let's review it together'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched with 'exhausting' (typically signals nervous laughter/awkwardness rather than exhaustion), though not inappropriate",
      "Could acknowledge the specific fear of damaging the friendship slightly earlier, though it does address this in the advice paragraph"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😊 or 💙 instead of 😅 to better match the 'exhausted' emotion, or omit the emoji entirely since the warmth comes through strongly in the language",
      "The validation is strong, but you could add one more sentence acknowledging the specific difficulty of setting boundaries with friends to make it even more relatable"
