    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate validation with relatable language: 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'That sinking feeling when you realize you double-booked yourself is the worst'",
      "Excellent natural use of first-person perspective throughout: 'I totally get why you're stressed,' 'I think your best bet,' and 'I'd reach out as soon as possible'",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact scripts: 'I'm so sorry, I completely forgot I had something else planned today - can I make it up somehow?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question combines two distinct questions ('What did you end up planning, and do you think...') which slightly violates the 'multiple questions at once' red flag",
      "Slight imbalance toward practical advice over emotional validation - only one paragraph of pure validation before moving to solutions",
      "Emoji choice (😅) slightly mismatches the 'frustrating' emotion described, though it works for the awkward realization moment"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and conversational first-person flow",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Balance between emotional support and practical solutions leans slightly too heavily toward advice (approximately 75% advice vs 25% validation)",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one more sentence of pure emotional validation before transitioning to advice to achieve better balance (e.g., 'It's so stressful when you feel like you're letting people down')",
      "Simplify the final question to a single inquiry rather than a compound question - perhaps 'Which one do you think would be easier to reschedule?' to avoid overwhelming the user"
