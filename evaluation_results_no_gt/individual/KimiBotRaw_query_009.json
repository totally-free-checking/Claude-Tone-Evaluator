    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using relatable language like 'That sinking feeling' and 'genuinely awful' that immediately makes the teen feel understood",
      "Provides excellent specific scripts the teen can actually use word-for-word ('I can tell something's up since you looked at my phone...') rather than vague suggestions",
      "Follow-up questions are highly specific and insightful (distinguishing between 'protective-weird or guilty-weird') showing genuine engagement with the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers ('**The direct approach:**', '**The wait-and-see:**', '**The prep work:**') that function as bullet points, breaking the conversational prose flow and feeling more like a self-help article",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses observational statements ('Sometimes parents do this thing') instead of personal perspective ('I think parents sometimes...' or 'I'd probably wait...') which creates distance rather than connection",
      "The structured formatting with labeled approaches feels more instructional than conversational, despite the casual language used within each section"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic strategies with specific phrasing the teen can use immediately, considering multiple scenarios (mental health vs. venting) and respecting teen agency",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - the use of bold headers to organize three approaches creates a structured, list-like format that diverges significantly from the ideal flowing paragraph style",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold headers ('The direct approach:', 'The wait-and-see:', 'The prep work:') that act as bullet points, preceded by 'Here are a few ways to handle the suspense:' which signals a list format. While content within sections is prose, the structural organization is heavily formatted and checklist-like."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove the bold headers and introductory phrase 'Here are a few ways...' and instead weave the three approaches into flowing paragraphs using transitions like 'You could try just naming the awkwardness directly...' or 'If that feels too intense, maybe wait a day...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout using phrases like 'I think the direct approach works best because...' or 'I'd probably feel so anxious in your shoes' to create the feeling of talking with a supportive friend rather than reading general advice",
      "Consider integrating the advice sections into a more natural narrative flow rather than distinct categorized options, perhaps by suggesting the teen choose based on their personality or the specific vibe they're getting from their parents"
