    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I promise', 'trust me') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script ('Oops, guess I really respect your authority') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing follow-up question at the end—fails to invite continued conversation as ideal character should",
      "Could more deeply validate the intensity of 'wanting to disappear' before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow—perfectly avoids bullet points and over-structuring while maintaining readability",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement—ends with a statement ('no need to disappear!') rather than an inviting question to continue the conversation",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with two natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end like 'How did your teacher react?' or 'Have you had to see them since it happened?' to keep the conversation going",
      "Consider acknowledging the 'wanting to disappear' feeling more specifically before pivoting to reassurance—e.g., 'That mortified feeling where you literally want to sink into the floor is so real'"
