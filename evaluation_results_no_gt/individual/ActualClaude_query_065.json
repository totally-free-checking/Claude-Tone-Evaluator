    "strengths": [
      "Provides very specific, actionable advice with exact phrases the teen can use like 'I'm gonna grab some water' and 'I'd rather not get into talking about [person's name]'",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that invites the teen to reflect on their friend's potential reaction",
      "Opens with immediate validation ('That's a tough spot to be in!' and 'totally understandable') acknowledging the difficulty of the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and structured formatting with bold headers ('**Redirect the conversation:**', '**Set a gentle boundary:**') instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Lacks first-person conversational language - doesn't use 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' making it feel more like an instruction manual than a friend talking",
      "Jumps quickly from brief validation to extensive structured advice without enough emotional support in between"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic scripts and actions specifically tailored to a teen's social situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses heavy formatting with four bold headers and six bullet points instead of flowing conversational paragraphs",

      "notes": "Response uses four bold headers (**Redirect**, **Set boundary**, etc.) with six bullet points total. The advice is delivered entirely through structured lists rather than natural sentences, making it read like a wikiHow article rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of listing options, weave them into sentences like 'If you want to redirect, you could try saying...' or 'I'd probably start by gently changing the subject...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - use phrases like 'I think the key is...', 'I'd say your friend probably doesn't realize...', and 'I get why that feels awkward...'",
      "Expand the emotional validation section before giving advice - spend more time acknowledging how uncomfortable and tricky this situation feels before jumping to solutions"
