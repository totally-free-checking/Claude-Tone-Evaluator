      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying' and reassurance that 'you're not being petty for feeling this way'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",
      "Specific first-person advice including exact scripts like 'I love you, but I've been feeling a little copied lately' and 'I'm not trying to fight'",

      "Could strengthen first-person connection with an explicit 'I get it' or 'I've been there' at the very opening",

      "Consider adding a brief first-person validation phrase like 'I totally get that' or 'That would drive me crazy too' right at the start to strengthen the personal connection before the analysis",
