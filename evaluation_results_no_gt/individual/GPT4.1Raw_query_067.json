    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading like natural conversation",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging follow-up question that invites the teen to share more about their specific worries",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice including specific phrasing the teen can use with parents ('let your parents know you’d like to focus on what matters now')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses impersonal 'Parents often...' and 'You can...' instead of 'I get that...' or 'I'd suggest...' which creates distance rather than connection",
      "Validation uses minimizing language ('pretty normal', 'a bit stressful', 'just in tenth grade') that slightly dismisses the emotional weight rather than fully validating it"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective and language - reads as impersonal advice rather than a supportive friend saying 'I get it' or 'I'd feel the same way'",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or structural formatting - perfectly aligned with ideal prose style"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: replace 'Parents often start thinking...' with 'I get why that feels early - my parents did the same thing' or 'I'd feel overwhelmed too'",
      "Strengthen emotional validation by removing minimizing words: change 'That's pretty normal, though it can feel a bit stressful' to 'Ugh, that's so much pressure!' or 'That sinking feeling is totally valid'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the beginning to set a supportive tone, though this is less critical than the first-person fix"
