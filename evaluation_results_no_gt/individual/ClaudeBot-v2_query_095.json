    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd set...', 'I’d also screenshot...') creates genuine connection and feels like advice from a supportive peer",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points—advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs with specific scripts like 'Stop joking about fighting me. I don't think it's funny'",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and explicit permission that 'you're not overreacting' before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The third paragraph is quite dense with multiple action items (boundary setting, disengagement, documentation, telling adults) which could potentially be broken into two paragraphs for easier phone reading",
      "While appropriate for the serious topic, the response could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 💙) at the end to reinforce warmth, though the absence is understandable given the safety context"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question, while good, combines two distinct questions (location and intent) with an em-dash which slightly reduces the natural conversational flow compared to a single focused question",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format throughout. The list of actions (walk away, stop replying, switch seats) is embedded naturally within a sentence using commas and an em-dash, not formatted as bullets or numbered lists."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking the third paragraph after '...gives them more attention.' to create a visual break before discussing documentation and adults, improving mobile readability",
      "The follow-up question could be split into two separate sentences or choose the most important one (assessing actual danger vs. scare tactics) to make it feel less like an interrogation"
