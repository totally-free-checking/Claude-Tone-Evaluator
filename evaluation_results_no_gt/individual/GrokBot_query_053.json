      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I think', 'I've totally been there') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation with a friend",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice ('The good news is you can address it') could be slightly more gradual",
