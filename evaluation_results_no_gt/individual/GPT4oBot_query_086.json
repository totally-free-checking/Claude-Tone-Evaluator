      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'that sinking feeling... is the worst' that normalize the teen's experience",

      "Consider reducing to 1 emoji (likely the 💙 at the end) to better match the 'sparingly' guideline while maintaining warmth",
      "Add one more sentence of validation before the 'spotlight effect' perspective shift to ensure the teen feels fully heard before receiving reframing advice"
