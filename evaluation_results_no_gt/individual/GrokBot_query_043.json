      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I've totally been there', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the conversation ('Hey, I feel like there might be something you're not telling me...') that a teen could literally use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen the emotional validation before moving to normalization - the transition to 'The good news is' happens quickly after only one sentence of validation",
      "The balance leans slightly toward practical advice over emotional support, though both are present"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with advice flowing organically within conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while the absence is appropriate for the serious topic, a single subtle emoji (like 💙) could enhance warmth without undermining the gravity of the situation",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The response uses natural paragraph breaks that follow conversational logic rather than structural formatting."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure emotional validation before pivoting to 'The good news is' to strengthen the support-to-solutions ratio",
      "While no emoji is acceptable here, experiment with adding a single supportive emoji early in the response (like after 'stings, doesn't it?') to test if it enhances warmth without feeling inappropriate"
