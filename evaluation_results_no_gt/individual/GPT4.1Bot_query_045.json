      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's honestly the worst' and acknowledgment of the 'helpless, angry feeling'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Provides specific, realistic script the teen can use: 'I totally get why you're upset, but I promise I wasn't the one who did that'",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I know', 'I think') creating genuine connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section could offer 1-2 alternative approaches based on who blamed them (parent vs. friend) for even more specific utility",
      "Missing explicit 'I'm here to talk' or 'I've got your back' closing statement before the question"

      "Consider adding one alternative strategy for situations where the teen has no backup witness, to cover more scenarios",
      "Could explicitly include a 'I'm here if you need to vent more' type statement to reinforce ongoing support before asking the follow-up question",
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense—could break into two paragraphs (one for the conversation script, one for the 'truth comes out' reassurance) for easier mobile reading"
