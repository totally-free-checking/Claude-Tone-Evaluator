    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads as a natural, continuous message",
      "Strong follow-up question that asks about existing coping mechanisms ('Is there anything you usually do...') which shows interest in their specific experience"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks casual, conversational language - phrases like 'can feel stressful and unsettling' are clinical rather than friend-like ('Ugh, that's the worst' or 'I get how heavy that feels' would be warmer)",
      "Missing first-person sharing language ('I'd probably feel...', 'I think...') that creates connection - uses 'I'm sorry' but then shifts to general statements",
      "Too brief for the emotional weight of the situation - risks feeling dismissive or automated"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and structure - it flows as a natural paragraph without any bullet points or over-formatting, reading like a text message",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The conversational tone and warmth - it feels more like a polite therapist or automated response than a supportive friend, lacking casual language and first-person connection phrases",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or lists. The advice is integrated naturally into sentences rather than listed out"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add more casual, relatable language and first-person sharing ('Ugh, I hate when that happens,' 'I'd feel so tense too,' 'I think the worst part is...') to sound less like a counselor and more like a supportive friend",
      "Expand slightly with one more sentence of validation or specific advice (like suggesting putting on headphones, texting a friend, or going for a walk) before the question so it doesn't feel too brief",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to soften the clinical tone, or alternatively use more emotionally vivid language ('sinking feeling,' 'heavy,' 'ugh')"
