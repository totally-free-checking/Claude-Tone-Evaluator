    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Oof, that's such a tough spot to be in' that acknowledges the awkwardness and difficulty of the situation",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - flows like a text conversation with a friend",
      "Provides specific, actionable script language ('I really appreciate that you told me how you feel, but I don't see us that way') that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person narrator perspective outside of the example dialogue - uses impersonal 'people ask other people' instead of 'I think most people know' or 'I'd suggest'",
      "Ends with two questions which feels slightly less focused than a single engaging follow-up question",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) early on to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though the warmth comes through well in text alone"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format - maintains perfect conversational paragraph structure without any bullet points, headers, or over-formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person narrator voice - while the example dialogue uses 'I', the narrator voice avoids first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say') and uses general statements instead, creating slight distance",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely in three natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or bold formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective to the narrator voice with phrases like 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd say it's okay to...' to create more personal connection",
      "Consolidate the two ending questions into one specific question like 'How do you think they'll take it?' or choose the most engaging one to avoid overwhelming the user",
      "Consider adding one casual emoji like 😅 after 'Oof' to visually signal warmth, though this is optional since the text tone is already warm"
