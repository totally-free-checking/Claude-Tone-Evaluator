    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and empathy ('Ugh, that is the worst feeling', 'you're not broken') and normalizes the experience effectively",
      "Uses highly specific, actionable techniques realistic for teens (box breathing with exact counts, brain dump using phone/napkin, 'scroll cat videos')",
      "Excellent conversational voice with natural phrases ('dryer full of sneakers', 'Do like 3 rounds', 'chill out', 'brains are weird like that')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers (**The 5-4-3-2-1 trick**, **box breathing**, **brain dump**) and a 5-item bullet list that breaks the conversational prose flow",
      "Lacks first-person supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or 'I get it' outside of hypothetical examples",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the supportive tone given the stress topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and practical advice quality - sounds like a supportive older sibling texting specific, doable techniques",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting structure - relies on bold headers and bullet points rather than flowing natural prose paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "One major bullet list with 5 items under a bold header, plus two additional bold headers for techniques (box breathing, brain dump). Creates a 'listicle' feel rather than pure conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the 5-4-3-2-1 technique to flowing prose: 'You could try naming five things you see, then four things you can physically feel...' instead of bullet points",
      "Add a warm closing with first-person availability like 'I'm here if you need to talk through it more' or 'I get how exhausting that is'",
      "Consider adding one supportive emoji early in the response (like 😅 after 'dryer full of sneakers') to match the casual, warm tone"
