    "strengths": [
      "Provides very specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('Hey! I noticed you send snaps late at night sometimes...') and detailed Snapchat settings instructions",
      "Uses appropriate casual language like 'Totally get that' and 'heads-up' that feels teen-appropriate without being cringe",
      "Good emoji usage with the sleep emoji at the end that fits the context perfectly"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers makes it read like an instruction manual rather than a conversation",
      "Completely missing a follow-up question to continue the dialogue - ends with a statement instead",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout; uses instructional 'you can'/'you could' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest'",
      "Validation is brief and immediately followed by structured solutions without deeper emotional acknowledgment"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - gives realistic, specific actions a teen can take immediately including exact wording for boundaries",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses three formatted bullet points with bold headers instead of conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response is structured as intro sentence, three detailed bullet points with bold headers and sub-instructions, and outro sentence. Reads like a help article rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation rather than listing options",
      "Add an engaging follow-up question at the end like 'Have you tried muting notifications before, or would you feel weird setting that boundary?'",
      "Incorporate first-person language like 'I think the easiest fix would be...' or 'I'd probably just mute them first' to sound more like a friend giving advice",
      "Expand the emotional validation before jumping to solutions - acknowledge how annoying it is to wake up to snaps and validate that it's okay to want uninterrupted sleep"
