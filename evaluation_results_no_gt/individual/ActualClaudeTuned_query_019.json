    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Oh no, that's such a stressful situation!' and 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with this' that acknowledge the specific emotional weight of false accusations",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, creating a conversational flow that reads like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I think your best move,' 'I can imagine how frustrated,' 'I'm so sorry') creating personal connection",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact script language ('I understand why the similarities look suspicious, but here's exactly how I approached this work...') and concrete evidence suggestions (notes, drafts, browser history)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji placement creates slight tonal dissonance by following immediately after words like 'awful,' 'frustrated,' and 'worried' - the nervous laughter emoji undercuts the serious emotional validation slightly",
      "Could benefit from mentioning one additional safety net option (like involving a parent or counselor) if the direct conversation doesn't resolve the issue, though the current advice is solid"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and complete absence of bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice and placement - using 😅 (nervous laughter) immediately after validating serious feelings of worry and frustration about academic integrity issues",

      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 💙, 😟, or no emoji instead of 😅 for serious situations involving academic stress, as the nervous laughter emoji slightly conflicts with the gravity of false cheating accusations",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of engagement in all responses"
