      "Immediate emotional validation with vivid empathetic language ('feels like you just want to disappear into the floor') that captures the teen's embarrassment",
      "Excellent use of first-person conditional advice ('If I were you, I'd...') that feels personal and supportive rather than prescriptive",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The advice to 'brush it off' could potentially feel slightly dismissive to some teens, though it is well-balanced by the prior validation and permission to 'be annoyed for a bit'",
      "Could include one more specific phrase example for how to approach the coach, though the suggestion provided is realistic"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language ('I totally get', 'I know', 'If I were you') that creates genuine connection",

      "Consider adding one more sentence validating that it's okay to feel upset for longer than just 'a bit' if needed, to avoid any perception of rushing the teen past their feelings",
      "The follow-up question about whether this is typical behavior for the coach is excellent and could be enhanced by briefly noting why that context matters (e.g., 'because that changes how you might handle it')"
