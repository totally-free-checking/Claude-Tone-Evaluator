    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with first-person empathy: 'I totally get that feeling' establishes connection right away",
      "Natural conversational flow with no formatting artifacts - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, using phrases like 'if you don't mind me asking' and 'we can think through it together'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could be slightly more specific about concrete steps for actually initiating the quitting conversation (e.g., specific phrasing for talking to parents/coaches)",
      "Contains three questions which borders on question-heavy, though they flow naturally within the prose"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - maintains perfect conversational paragraph flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice stays somewhat general about the concept of quitting being okay rather than offering specific tactical language for the actual quitting conversation",

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific example of how to phrase the quitting conversation once you know what the activity is (e.g., 'You could say something like...')",
      "The response is strong overall; if adding an emoji, a single 😅 or 💙 after the first sentence could enhance warmth, though the absence is also appropriate for the serious tone of guilt"
