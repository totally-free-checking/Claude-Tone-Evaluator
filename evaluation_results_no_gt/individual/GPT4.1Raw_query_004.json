    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose format with natural flow and zero bullet points, reading like a real text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst!' and acknowledging how hard it is not to overthink",
      "Provides specific, actionable texting scripts like 'Hey, I feel like something's up—are you alright?' that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses general 'you could' and 'sometimes' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest', making it feel slightly impersonal",
      "Missing emoji that could enhance warmth for this anxious situation (though zero emojis is acceptable, one might have helped)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, allowing advice to flow conversationally within paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone lacks first-person perspective - it advises using 'you could' and general statements rather than sharing personally with 'I think' or 'I'd say'",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create stronger connection, such as 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd probably feel the same way' instead of general 'you' statements",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to match the casual texting context, though the current no-emoji approach is acceptable"
