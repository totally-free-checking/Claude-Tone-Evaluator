      "Provides excellent specific scripts the teen can use like 'Hey, I want to respect you. Is this something you're okay with me knowing...'",
      "Includes crucial safety exception guidance about when to break confidentiality (self-harm, abuse, etc.)",
      "Follow-up question is specific to the situation, asking about how they learned the secret and what type it is"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers makes it read like a wiki article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get why you're worried' to create personal connection",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping to advice - only one brief sentence acknowledging it's uncomfortable"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic steps including specific phrases to say and clear safety guidelines",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - uses extensive bullet points, bold text, and structured headers instead of natural conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'A few practical ways to handle it:' as a header, followed by a bulleted list with bold headers (**Don't pass it on**, **Figure out how you learned it**, etc.) and sub-bullets. This creates a very structured, instructional feel rather than a flowing conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation, using transitions like 'I'd probably start by figuring out how you learned it...'",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout, such as 'I totally get why that feels heavy' or 'I think the safest bet is...' to sound like a supportive friend rather than an advice column",
      "Move the emotional validation to the top and expand it before getting into the practical steps - sit with the feeling first, then problem-solve"
