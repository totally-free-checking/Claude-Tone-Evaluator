    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry—that's honestly the worst' and explicit confirmation that 'Your feelings are 100% valid'",
      "Very specific, actionable advice with exact phrases the teen can use like 'That's a weird thing to say to someone' and 'I'd rather you not talk about my appearance, thanks'",
      "Strong follow-up question that is specific to the situation: 'Want to share who's doing it? I might be able to help you workshop a specific response'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and formatted headers (**If it's safe to push back:**, **If it's at work/school:**) which breaks the conversational flow",
      "Missing first-person language in the advice sections ('I think you could try...' or 'I'd probably say...') - uses impersonal structures instead",
      "Could use one subtle emoji to enhance warmth given the emotional difficulty of the topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The balance of emotional validation and practical advice - it validates feelings first, offers concrete scripts for different scenarios, acknowledges safety concerns, and reaffirms support at the end",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting structure with bold headers and bullet points makes it read like a wiki article rather than a text conversation with a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response starts and ends with prose but the core advice is delivered through three categorized bullet sections with bold headers. The middle section is essentially a formatted list rather than conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose by removing the headers and integrating the advice naturally: 'If it's safe to push back, you could try a direct shutdown like... Or you could use the uncomfortable pause strategy where you just stare at them...'",
      "Add more first-person perspective throughout the advice portion, such as 'I think the direct approach works best' or 'I'd probably document this if it's at school'",
      "Consider adding one subtle supportive emoji (like 💙 or 😤) early in the response to signal warmth, or keep it emoji-free but add more casual interjections like 'honestly' or 'yk?' to maintain the texting vibe"
