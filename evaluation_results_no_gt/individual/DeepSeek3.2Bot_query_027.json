    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'That's the worst feeling!' and 'so, so frustrating' that acknowledges the specific pain of executive dysfunction",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with natural flow between validation, normalization, and advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen validation by specifically naming the stress of having FIVE assignments before moving to the 'happens to everyone' normalization",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly quick - could add one more sentence acknowledging how overwhelming the pile feels"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose paragraph structure with absolutely no bullet points or formatting - maintains conversational flow throughout while delivering practical advice embedded in sentences",

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no lists, headers, bold text, or structured formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence specifically validating the overwhelm of having five things due at once before moving to the 'everyone experiences this' normalization",
      "The advice is excellent but could include a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar supportive closing before the question to reinforce emotional availability"
