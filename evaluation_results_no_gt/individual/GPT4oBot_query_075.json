      "Excellent use of first-person language and personal perspective ('If I were in your shoes, I'd...', 'I get that totally') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural elements - flows like a natural text conversation",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions rather than one focused follow-up, which slightly dilutes the engagement",

      "Consider narrowing the ending to one specific question rather than two (e.g., just 'Have you decided if you're going to go yet?' or 'What's your gut feeling telling you?')",
      "Add one more validating phrase before the pivot to 'the good part is' to let the emotional acknowledgment land more deeply (e.g., 'That anxiety is so valid and real')"
