    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get how nervous that can feel', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'I'm here if you need to talk' vibe) creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with an older sibling or friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation using physical and emotional empathy ('flutter in your stomach', 'stepping into a room where you don't know what's going to happen')",
      "Specific, actionable advice including an exact script the teen could use ('Hey, I've been feeling a bit stressed lately and could use some advice')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question 'How are you thinking about starting the conversation?' is good but slightly generic - could be more specific to their particular worries about the counselor",
      "Could acknowledge potential specific fears (like confidentiality or being judged) to make the validation even more targeted, though the general validation is strong"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose combined with consistent first-person perspective ('I get', 'I'd try', 'If I were you') makes it feel like a real supportive person rather than an advice bot",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition to advice uses 'If I were you, I'd try a few simple things:' which is slightly more structured/list-like in phrasing, though it remains in prose format",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The advice flows naturally within paragraph 3 using coordinating conjunctions rather than list formatting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider acknowledging specific common fears about counseling (confidentiality, being judged, not knowing what to say) to make validation even more targeted",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more open-ended like 'What's making you most nervous about it?' to invite deeper sharing rather than focusing just on the conversation opener"
