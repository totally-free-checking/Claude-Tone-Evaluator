    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'What I'd probably do', 'I'd keep it simple') creating a genuine peer-to-peer connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with visceral language ('gross feeling', 'sick to your stomach', 'hide') that captures the physical experience of betrayal",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Yeah, I heard about that. It's not true at all...') rather than vague 'just ignore it' advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could include one more sentence acknowledging the unfairness of having to manage others' behavior when you did nothing wrong",
      "The follow-up question, while good, slightly shifts the burden to the teen to categorize their trauma rather than asking how they're feeling right now"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural first-person prose format that reads exactly like a supportive older sibling or friend texting advice, using 'I'd' and 'I think' throughout to create authentic connection rather than impersonal directives",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question is slightly clinical in structure ('Knowing a bit more might help me think of...') compared to the warm casual tone of the rest of the response",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the strong first-person approach ('I'd say', 'I think') as it creates the feeling of a real person sharing their perspective rather than an authority figure dispensing rules",
      "Consider adding one sentence acknowledging the injustice ('It's so unfair you have to deal with this') between the validation and advice sections to bridge the emotional and practical support even more smoothly"
