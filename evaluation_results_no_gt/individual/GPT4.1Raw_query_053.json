    },
    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, making it feel like a real conversation",
      "Validates feelings immediately with 'That's really frustrating!' and acknowledges the disappointment of cancelled plans",
      "Provides realistic, age-appropriate advice that recognizes the teen's agency (protecting their own time) while suggesting compassionate approaches"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal constructions like 'It can feel' and 'Sometimes people don't realize' which creates distance rather than connection",
      "Could be warmer and more relatable - 'That's really frustrating' is polite but lacks the casual empathy of 'Ugh, that's the worst!' or 'We've all been there'",
      "Ends with a closed-ended yes/no question ('Would you like some advice...') rather than an open, engaging question that invites sharing"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads as continuous conversational text",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language makes the response feel impersonal and detached, like reading an advice column rather than texting with a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose structure with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: instead of 'It can feel hurtful,' try 'I get why that feels hurtful,' or 'I'd be so disappointed too'",
      "Replace the closed-ended final question with something more conversational and open, like 'Do you think something's going on with them, or is this just how they are?'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a supportive tone, or use more casual validating phrases like 'Ugh, that's so annoying!'"
