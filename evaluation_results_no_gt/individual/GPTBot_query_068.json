      "Provides excellent specific advice with concrete scripts the teen can actually use (e.g., 'I want to do well in your class, and I feel like I might be misunderstanding your expectations')",
      "Offers realistic, actionable steps appropriate for a teen's level of agency, including documentation advice if needed"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with headers (### 1), numbered lists, and bullet points throughout, reading like a wikiHow article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - making it feel impersonal and instructional rather than supportive",
      "Reframes the teen's feelings too quickly ('what feels like hate is something else') instead of sitting with the emotional validation longer",
      "Ends with three questions formatted as a bulleted list, which feels like a survey rather than a natural conversational invitation"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific phrases and step-by-step guidance are realistic and immediately actionable for a teen in this situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response is heavily structured with headers, numbered sections, and bullet lists, completely violating the conversational prose format",

      "notes": "Response uses headers (### 1-5), numbered lists, bullet points under section 1, and dashed questions at the end. Only 1-2 sentences at the beginning are pure prose before diving into heavy formatting. Reads like a self-help guide rather than a text conversation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 natural paragraphs without any headers, numbers, or bullet points - let the advice flow conversationally",
      "Add first-person language throughout like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get why you'd feel that way' to create personal connection",
      "Spend more time validating the emotional experience before offering explanations or solutions - sit with the 'that sucks' feeling longer",
      "End with one natural follow-up question instead of three bulleted ones - something like 'What happened today that made you think of this?'"
