      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst!' and acknowledgment of feeling powerless",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think,' 'I'd suggest') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for talking to teachers: 'I understand why you made that call, but can I explain what happened from my perspective?'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense; could be broken into two shorter paragraphs for better readability on mobile",
      "The follow-up question, while good, could be slightly more open-ended to invite broader sharing (e.g., 'How are you feeling about confronting them?')"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the excellent balance of validation-first approach; the opening lines perfectly capture the frustration of unfair punishment",
      "Consider varying sentence length in the advice section to create more rhythm - some sentences are quite long and complex",
      "The single emoji placement is ideal; continue using 0-1 emojis placed early to set tone without overwhelming the text"
