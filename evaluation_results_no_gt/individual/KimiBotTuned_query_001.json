    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Oh nooo' and 'instant stomach-drop moments' that perfectly capture the feeling of embarrassment",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact scripts to say ('Yeah… rough morning' or 'It’s my new fashion era') and practical logistics (tucking feet under desk, waiting for bathroom break)",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which would make it feel more like a personal conversation rather than general advice",
      "Could include slightly more validation before moving to the reframing ('it feels way louder than it actually is')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question is perfectly crafted—specific to the situation (asking about shoe similarity), natural and conversational, and invites the teen to share more details",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of first-person pronouns and phrases ('I think', 'I'd suggest') makes the advice feel slightly impersonal despite the warm tone",

      "Add first-person perspective to increase connection, such as 'I totally get that stomach-drop feeling' or 'I'd probably try to tuck my feet under the desk'",
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase before the perspective shift, like 'I'd be mortified too' to emphasize you're personally relating before explaining it's not as bad as it feels"
