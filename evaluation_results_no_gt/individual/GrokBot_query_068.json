    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that feeling of thinking your teacher has it out for you is the worst' and personal connection through 'I've totally been there'",
      "Strong use of first-person conditional advice ('If I were you, I'd start by...') which makes the guidance feel personal and relatable rather than prescriptive",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to the teacher ('Hey, I was wondering if there's something I can improve on my last assignment?') that is realistic and non-confrontational"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from emotional validation to perspective-giving ('teachers are human too') happens somewhat quickly and could benefit from one additional validating sentence before shifting to advice",
      "While the emoji usage is appropriate, the 😩 might feel slightly intense for the opening; a gentler emoji like 😓 or simply no emoji would also work for this sensitive topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and excellent first-person conversational language that reads like texting with a supportive older sibling",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The balance between validation and solutions leans slightly toward the practical advice side, with the perspective shift happening in the second paragraph rather than after more extensive emotional acknowledgment",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The response flows naturally through four conversational paragraphs with advice embedded organically within sentences rather than listed out"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one more sentence of pure validation after 'I've totally been there' before shifting to the 'teachers are human' perspective to ensure the teen feels fully heard",
      "Consider softening the transition to advice with a phrase like 'I know this is hard, but when you're ready, here's what I'd try' to maintain the emotional connection while moving to practical steps"
