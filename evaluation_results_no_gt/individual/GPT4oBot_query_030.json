    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd say' implied in tone) creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the difficult conversation ('Hey, I'm sorry, but I really don't feel comfortable sharing my homework anymore') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The response is slightly on the longer side, though it remains readable and doesn't ramble",
      "Could potentially include one more specific validation phrase about the friendship dynamic itself, though the existing validation is strong"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow - it reads like a continuous, supportive message from a friend without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, perfectly matching the ideal character's communication style.",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "While the length is generally good, it borders on slightly verbose with four substantial paragraphs, though this is a minor issue given the quality of content.",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "The response is entirely in natural paragraph form with no bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining a conversational text-message feel throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using specific scripts and phrases like the boundary-setting example provided - this gives teens concrete words to use when they're nervous about confrontation",
      "The question at the end is excellent and specific; maintain this pattern of asking targeted follow-ups about the specific person/situation rather than generic 'how do you feel' questions"
