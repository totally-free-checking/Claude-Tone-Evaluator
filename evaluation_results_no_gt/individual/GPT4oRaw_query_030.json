    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with no bullet points or over-structuring - reads like a natural text message",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I've noticed I've been sharing my homework with you a lot...'",
      "Appropriate length - substantial enough to be helpful but concise enough for mobile reading"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - feels like generic advice rather than a supportive friend sharing their perspective",
      "Follow-up question 'What do you think?' is too generic and doesn't show specific interest in their unique situation",
      "Could validate the emotional difficulty more deeply - acknowledging how awkward/guilty it feels to set boundaries with friends, not just that it's 'frustrating'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - offering a specific word-for-word script that balances kindness with firmness is exactly what a teen needs in this situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The impersonal tone - using 'You could...' and 'It's important to...' instead of 'I'd probably...' or 'I think you should...' makes it feel like an advice column rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow. The indented quote is integrated into the text flow rather than being a bulleted list."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: change 'You could tell them' to 'I'd probably say something like' and 'It's important to set boundaries' to 'I think setting boundaries here is important'",
      "Make the follow-up question more specific to their situation, such as 'Do you think they'd be receptive to studying together instead?' or 'What's making it hardest to say no to them?'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early on (like 😅 or 😬) to match the 'Ugh, that's frustrating' energy and enhance the casual tone"
