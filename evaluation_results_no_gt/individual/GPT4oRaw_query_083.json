    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' makes it feel impersonal and article-like",
      "Heavy use of markdown headers (###) and numbered lists (1-6) makes it read like a wiki article rather than a conversation",

      "Rewrite entirely in paragraph form - instead of listing 'Playful Teasing' as a bullet, work it into sentences like 'I'd say if they're joking around with you or lightly teasing in a fun way, that could be a sign'",
      "Add first-person language throughout like 'I think', 'I'd guess', or 'I get why that's confusing' to sound like a real person texting",
      "End with a natural follow-up question like 'What kind of vibes are you getting from them specifically?' or 'Do they do any of these things with just you or everyone?'",
      "Add one warm emoji early on (like 😅) to match the 'classic dilemma' confusion vibe"
