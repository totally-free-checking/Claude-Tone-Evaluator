    "strengths": [
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice with concrete scripts the teen can use ('I understand the concern. Can you tell me which parts match...')",
      "Offers realistic, age-appropriate strategies like using Google Docs history or offering to redo problems live",
      "Covers multiple scenarios (studying together vs. copying, escalation procedures) showing thorough understanding of academic integrity processes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language and conversational warmth - reads like an administrative handbook rather than a supportive friend ('Here's a good approach:', 'Teachers are looking for a believable process')",
      "Heavy over-formatting with 6 numbered headers, multiple bullet lists, and structured sections destroys conversational flow",
      "Minimal emotional validation - only 'That's stressful' before immediately pivoting to solutions, with no empathetic language like 'I'm so sorry' or 'That must feel awful'",
      "Ends with a clinical intake-style list of three questions rather than a natural, curious follow-up"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific scripts and concrete steps (timestamps, offering to redo problems, follow-up emails) are realistic and immediately actionable for a teen in this situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response uses heavy formatting with ### headers, numbered sections (1-6), and bullet lists throughout, reading like a wikiHow article rather than a text conversation",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 6 major numbered headers (### 1 through ### 6) with extensive bullet points under each. The only prose is the initial sentence and brief transitions. Reads as a structured guide rather than conversational text."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace the structured headers and bullets with natural paragraphs: 'First, I'd suggest staying calm and asking for clarity. You could say something like... Then, if they ask for proof, show them your process by sharing...'",
      "Add genuine emotional validation upfront using first-person empathy: 'Oh wow, that's such a stressful situation! I can feel my stomach dropping just imagining being accused of cheating when you didn't. That feels so unfair and scary.'",
      "Change the ending from a numbered list of three questions to one natural follow-up: 'What subject was this for? And did you happen to study with that other person at all, even if you didn't copy?'",
      "Remove all ### headers and bold text formatting to make it feel like a text from a supportive older sibling rather than an academic integrity manual"
