    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with 'I get how the panic rush hits you right in the chest' - uses first-person empathy perfectly",
      "Natural conversational language with 'Ugh' and 'totally spaced' that sounds like a peer without trying too hard",
      "Perfect emoji usage with one well-placed 😅 that captures the embarrassed/nervous feeling about forgetting homework"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Response is incomplete - cuts off mid-sentence at 'yeah, we've' leaving the thought unfinished",
      "No practical advice provided whatsoever due to truncation",
      "Missing follow-up question to continue the conversation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - immediately acknowledges the physical anxiety of the situation with 'panic rush hits you right in the chest' and uses first-person connection ('I get how')",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Completeness and length - the response is cut off after just one sentence, making it impossible to provide the practical advice and follow-up engagement needed for a complete teen support interaction",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Pure prose format with natural flow and no structural elements, though the response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Complete the truncated sentence ('yeah, we've...' likely intended to be 'yeah, we've all been there') and expand to 2-4 paragraphs total",
      "Add specific, actionable advice for handling the forgotten homework situation (e.g., what to say to the teacher, how to approach them after class)",
      "End with a natural follow-up question like 'Has this teacher been understanding before?' or 'Do you think you can catch them after class?' to continue the conversation"
