    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation: 'Oh no, I'm so sorry, that's such an awkward and lonely feeling' paired with the hyper-awareness observation",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with four cohesive paragraphs",
      "Strong first-person connection with 'I've definitely been there too' and 'I've seen people sit by themselves' creating peer-like solidarity",
      "Specific actionable advice including 'focusing on your phone or homework to look busy' and approaching someone else sitting alone"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section could use more first-person framing (e.g., 'I'd suggest' or 'I think') rather than jumping straight to 'If you're feeling awkward, maybe try'",
      "Slight imbalance toward solution/reframing in paragraphs 2-3 compared to the emotional validation in paragraph 1"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from validation to advice could be bridged with more first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent adherence to prose-only format. Response uses four natural paragraphs with no lists, bold text, or headers. Advice is integrated smoothly into sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to the advice section, such as 'I'd probably just focus on my phone...' or 'I think the best move would be...' to maintain the warm, personal tone throughout",
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase before 'The good news is' to ensure the emotional acknowledgment isn't cut short by the pivot to reframing"
