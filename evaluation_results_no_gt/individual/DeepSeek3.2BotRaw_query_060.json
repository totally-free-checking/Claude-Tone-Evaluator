    "strengths": [
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice that is realistic for a teen's situation (e.g., suggesting to talk to the friend, be respectful but genuine)",
      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question about whether this is recent or ongoing, showing genuine interest in the context"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered bullet points with bold headers instead of conversational prose, reading like a self-help article rather than a text from a supportive friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making the tone feel impersonal and instructional rather than empathetic and connected",
      "Brief validation at the beginning ('tough spot') quickly gives way to four bullet points of advice without sufficient emotional acknowledgment"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end is natural and specific to the situation, inviting the teen to share more context",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting uses a numbered list with bold headers (1-4) and imperative instructions ('Stay respectful', 'Give it time'), which is the opposite of the conversational prose style required",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'A few things to keep in mind:' followed by 4 numbered bullets with bold headers (**It's often not about you personally.**). This is highly structured formatting that breaks conversational flow. Only the opening sentence and closing question are in prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as natural prose paragraphs instead of numbered bullets - imagine texting a friend advice rather than writing a wikiHow article",
      "Add first-person language throughout like 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get how awkward that feels' to create a personal connection rather than giving impersonal instructions",
      "Expand the emotional validation at the beginning before offering solutions - acknowledge how uncomfortable and isolating it feels to sense disapproval from a friend's parents"
