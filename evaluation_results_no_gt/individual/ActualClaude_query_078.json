    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and empathy ('Ugh, that's such an awkward situation!') that immediately acknowledges the teen's discomfort",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice that's realistic for teens (being 'busy,' reducing text responses, managing mutual friends)",
      "Ends with engaging, specific follow-up questions that show genuine interest in the details of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a 4-item bullet point list instead of natural prose paragraphs, which breaks the conversational flow ('A few things you could try:' followed by dashes)",
      "Lacks first-person language and perspective-sharing - doesn't use 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' to create personal connection, instead using impersonal instructional phrasing ('The key is...', 'You don't have to...')",
      "Could benefit from slightly more emotional validation before jumping to the solution-oriented bullet points"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up questions are natural, specific to the situation, and inviting - asking whether the person is being pushy or just missing social cues shows real engagement with the teen's dilemma",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The heavy reliance on bullet points for advice delivery - the ideal character should weave suggestions into flowing conversational paragraphs rather than structured lists",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "65%",
      "notes": "Response uses a prominent 4-item bullet list under 'A few things you could try:' which significantly detracts from the conversational, text-like quality. The advice should be integrated into natural sentences rather than formatted as a checklist."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose by combining the suggestions into 1-2 conversational paragraphs using transitions like 'I'd probably start by...' or 'Maybe you could try...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I think the key is being kind but not leading them on' or 'I'd say just gradually reduce how often you respond' to create a more personal, supportive connection",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after the opening validation to enhance the casual, friendly tone without overdoing it"
