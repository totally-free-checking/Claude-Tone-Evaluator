    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd start...', 'I'm here if you want to talk') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I'm really sorry you're going through this. I'm here if you want to talk or just need someone to listen.'",
      "Strong physical/emotional validation with 'It totally makes your chest tighten a bit' acknowledging the anxiety of the situation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while referring to the user's uncertainty, may feel slightly too casual given the serious context of a friend who is 'struggling' (potentially mental health related)",
      "Could slightly deepen validation of the friend's struggle itself, not just the user's uncertainty about how to respond"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider replacing 😅 with 💙 or 😊, or omitting entirely, as the 'nervous laughter' connotation may feel dismissive of a potentially serious mental health situation",
      "Maintain the strong first-person advisory voice ('If I were you...') as this is the most effective element of the response"
