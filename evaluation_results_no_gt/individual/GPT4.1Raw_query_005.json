    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation: 'I'm really sorry that's happening—you don't deserve that stress' acknowledges the emotional impact immediately",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question: 'Want to talk about what the rumor is or just need to vent?' which offers specific options and shows genuine availability"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points (6 numbered items with bold headers) creates a self-help article feel rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout the advice section (no 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'In my experience') making the middle section feel impersonal and detached",
      "Uses adult-oriented terminology like 'colleagues' and 'HR' which may not resonate with a teen's school context",
      "Minimal emotional validation relative to advice volume—only one brief empathetic sentence before 6 sections of practical tips"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end perfectly captures the supportive, conversational tone by offering the teen a choice to share details or simply vent, showing genuine care for their emotional needs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is almost entirely structured bullet points with bold headers, which reads like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive text from a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response consists of 2 introductory sentences, followed by 'Here are a few tips:' and 6 numbered bullet points with bold headers, ending with 1 question sentence. This is the opposite of the natural prose ideal."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the six bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave advice naturally using first-person language like 'If I were you, I'd probably...' or 'I think the best first step is...' to maintain conversational warmth throughout",
      "Replace adult-centric terms like 'colleagues' and 'HR' with teen-relevant language like 'classmates' and 'school counselor' or 'parents' to ensure the advice feels applicable to their actual life",
      "Add one supportive emoji (like 💙 or 😔) after the opening validation to enhance warmth, and expand the emotional acknowledgment to 2-3 sentences before transitioning to advice"
