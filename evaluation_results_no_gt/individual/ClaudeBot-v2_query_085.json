    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I'm gonna sit this one out', 'I'd talk to them') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word scripts the teen can actually use in the moment ('I'm not trying to pick sides, I'm gonna sit this one out' and 'I like you guys, but the fighting is stressing me out—can we keep me out of it?')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow—no bullets, headers, or over-structuring, reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😓 or 😅) early on to visually reinforce the 'exhausting' sentiment, though the warmth comes through strongly in text alone",

      "Consider adding one subtle emoji at the start (like 😓 or 😅) to match the 'exhausting' sentiment and add visual warmth, though this is optional",
