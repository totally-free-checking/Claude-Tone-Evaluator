    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were in your shoes, I'd probably try') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, that's such a weird spot to be in' followed by relatable emotional acknowledgment"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) early on to visually match the 'Ugh' sentiment, though the absence is still appropriate",
      "The transition from validation to advice could include an explicit 'I think' or 'I'd say' to further emphasize the personal perspective"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and structured formatting while maintaining readability",

      "Consider adding one casual emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after the opening 'Ugh' to enhance visual warmth without overdoing it",
      "The phrase 'If I were in your shoes' is excellent first-person language; you could also sprinkle in 'I think' or 'I'd say' before advice statements to further personalize the tone"
