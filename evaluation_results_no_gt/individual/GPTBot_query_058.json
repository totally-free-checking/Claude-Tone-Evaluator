    "strengths": [
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts that teens can literally read to the counselor (e.g., 'I'm nervous to talk about this, but I think I need help')",
      "Addresses realistic teen concerns about confidentiality and control with practical suggestions like writing a note or bringing a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and instructional rather than conversational",
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers (###) makes it read like a wiki article or pamphlet rather than a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - the specific scripts and realistic strategies for managing the conversation with a counselor are exactly what a nervous teen needs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting and structure - using headers and bullet points throughout instead of natural prose paragraphs makes it feel clinical and overwhelming rather than warm and conversational",

      "bullet_count": 14,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses multiple sections with headers (###) and extensive bullet lists. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are prose. Reads like an informational guide rather than a conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 natural paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of listing 'What to expect', write it as 'I'd say the first thing to know is that their job is to help, not to get you in trouble...'",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout, such as 'I totally get why that feels intimidating' or 'I'd be nervous too' to create a personal connection rather than sounding like a manual",
      "Start with more emotional validation before jumping into the 'here are things that help' section - sit with their feelings first"
