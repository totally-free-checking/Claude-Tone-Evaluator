    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual, empathetic language ('Oof, that's such a tricky and totally human situation')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks emoji usage which could enhance warmth for this emotionally vulnerable topic (though absence is acceptable)",
      "Practical advice, while good, could include one more specific example of what to journal about or a concrete conversation script"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no lists, headers, or robotic structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while not required, one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) could enhance the emotional connection for this guilt-related topic",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out. No headers, bold text, or structural formatting - exactly matches the ideal conversational style."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to visually signal warmth, though the text alone is already quite warm",
      "When suggesting journaling, you could add a specific prompt example like 'Maybe write down what qualities draw you to each person and see what patterns emerge' to make the advice even more actionable"
