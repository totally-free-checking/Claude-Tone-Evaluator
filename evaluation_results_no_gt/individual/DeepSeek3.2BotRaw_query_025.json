    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Totally get why that's frustrating' and acknowledging the 'jarring' feeling",
      "Natural follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specifics ('what it was for') rather than generic check-ins",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading like a natural text message"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Severely lacking in length - only one sentence of validation plus a question, far below the ideal 2-4 paragraphs",
      "Complete absence of practical advice or actionable suggestions; only validates without offering any 'here's what you can do'",
      "Missing explicit first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I'm here') - uses 'Totally get' instead of 'I totally get', making it feel slightly less personal"

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or lists. However, the entire response is only one sentence long, making it feel more like an opening text than a complete supportive response."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand to 2-3 paragraphs: add a paragraph with practical advice (e.g., 'I'd suggest asking her about it when you're both calm...') between the validation and the question",
      "Add explicit first-person language to build connection: change 'Totally get' to 'I totally get' or 'I completely understand', and consider adding 'I'm here to help you figure this out'",
      "While the question is good, the response needs substance between validation and the question - offer at least one concrete strategy for approaching the conversation with their mom"
