    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd love') creates genuine connection and feels like texting with a supportive friend",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that is honestly *so* confusing!', 'everyone's been there') that acknowledges the specific anxiety of interpreting social signals",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs with smooth transitions between validation and practical tips"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one (like 😅 or 😊) could have enhanced the warm, casual tone at the opening",
      "Could include a specific example phrase or script for 'testing the waters' to make the practical advice even more actionable"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - consistently uses 'I' statements and casual phrasing ('Total mind game', 'honestly way harder') that makes it feel like a real person rather than an AI",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - completely absent when a single well-placed emoji could have reinforced the warm, empathetic opening",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph format throughout. Uses a colon to introduce examples ('watch for things like: do they...') but keeps it flowing as natural prose rather than breaking into a list. No headers, bold text (except italic emphasis on 'so'), or numbered items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅) at the start to complement the 'Ugh' and enhance the friendly, casual tone",
      "When suggesting to 'test the waters,' include a specific example of what to say (e.g., 'try teasing them back about something silly') to make the advice even more concrete"
