      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a natural conversational flow",
      "Strong follow-up question that specifically asks about the activity and invites sharing to process guilt"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel like general advice rather than a supportive friend texting",
      "Opens with validation but misses immediate empathetic warmth ('Ugh, that guilt is so heavy' or 'We've all been there')"

      "Add first-person language throughout: change 'try asking yourself' to 'I'd suggest asking yourself' and 'Remember' to 'I think it's important to remember'",
      "Open with more immediate warmth and validation like 'Ugh, that guilty feeling is the worst' before moving to 'It's completely normal'",
      "Consider adding one gentle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to signal warmth, though the absence is acceptable for this serious topic"
