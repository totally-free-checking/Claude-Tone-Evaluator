    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such a stomach-drop moment' that perfectly captures the physical sensation of seeing a crush with someone else",
      "Specific, actionable advice with realistic scripts teens can actually use like 'hey, how's your day going?' rather than vague suggestions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person singular language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - uses observational 'our brains' instead of personal perspective, making it feel less like a specific person texting",
      "Missing explicit supportive closing language like 'I'm here if you need to talk' that would reinforce the supportive relationship"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a conversational text message between friends",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective - the response never uses 'I' statements to share personal perspective or create a sense of a specific supportive person talking to the teen",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph format throughout with natural conversational flow. Advice is seamlessly integrated into prose without any lists, headers, or structured formatting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language like 'I totally get why you'd feel that way' or 'I think the simplest move is...' to create a more personal, intimate connection that feels like a real person sharing their perspective",
      "Include a brief supportive closing statement like 'I'm here if you want to talk more' to reinforce that this is an ongoing supportive conversation rather than a one-off advice dump"
