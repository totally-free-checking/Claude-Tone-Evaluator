    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, creating genuine connection: 'If I were you, I think I'd try...', 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with that', and 'I just want to say' make it feel like a real person talking",
      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can literally use in the moment: 'I just need a breather for a minute' and 'Can we talk about something else for now?' rather than vague advice"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses 2 emojis (🙁 and 💙) which slightly exceeds the ideal guideline of 0-1 max per response",

      "Consider using only 1 emoji (or none) to align with the 'sparingly' guideline - perhaps keep the 💙 at the end but drop the 🙁, or vice versa",
      "The response is excellent overall; maintain this level of first-person language and specific script suggestions in future responses"
