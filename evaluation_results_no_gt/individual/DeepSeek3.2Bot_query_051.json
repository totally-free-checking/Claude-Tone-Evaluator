      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's such a rough feeling to have - it really stings' that names the emotion directly",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 'brains jump to worst-case scenario' perspective, while validating, comes slightly early before fully sitting with the pain of feeling like a backup",
