    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('I'm so sorry you're dealing with stress headaches - those are the worst!') that acknowledges the physical and emotional weight of the situation",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd try', 'Sometimes I find') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs like 'For right now though, I'd try some basic stuff like drinking more water...'",
      "Strong follow-up question that is specific to their situation ('is it one big thing or just everything piling up at once?') showing genuine curiosity"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice, while realistic, is somewhat basic (water, fresh air, breaks) and could include one more specific teen-relevant stress management technique",
      "Missing a gentle safety note about mentioning persistent headaches to a parent or doctor, which would be responsible for physical health concerns"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice breadth - while actionable, it could offer slightly more comprehensive or creative stress-relief options specific to teen life (study breaks, phone boundaries, etc.)",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific teen-relevant stress management tip (like the 20-20-20 rule for screen time or a quick grounding technique) to complement the general advice",
      "Include a gentle, non-alarming reminder that if headaches persist or are severe, it's worth mentioning to a parent or school nurse, just to cover safety bases while maintaining the supportive tone"
