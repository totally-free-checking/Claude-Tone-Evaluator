    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'If I were you, I'd start', 'you're stuck there') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs ('I'd start with something super casual...')",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and validating the physical sensation of wanting to hide"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slight minimization risk in paragraph 2 ('it probably feels way bigger in the moment than it actually is') could potentially invalidate the teen's experience before fully acknowledging it, though 'Honestly' softens this",
      "Could include slightly more specific validation about the grief of losing a friendship before pivoting to normalization"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow with embedded first-person advice - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight pivot to normalization ('feels way bigger than it actually is') comes before fully sitting with the emotional weight of the awkwardness",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence validating the specific sadness of the friendship ending before the 'it feels bigger than it is' perspective",
      "The first-person language is excellent - maintain this 'If I were you' and 'I totally get it' style as it creates strong rapport",
      "The follow-up question about what made things 'go south' is perfect teen vernacular - keep using this casual, non-clinical language"
