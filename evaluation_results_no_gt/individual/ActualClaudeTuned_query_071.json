    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd', 'I totally get', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific empathetic phrases like 'That pit in your stomach is so real' and acknowledging 'it's honestly one of the worst feelings'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - no bullets, headers, or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could enhance warmth slightly with one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) given the anxiety topic, though the absence is not problematic",
      "Practical advice could include specific scripting for how to approach the teacher conversation (what exactly to say)",
      "Slight abrupt transition with 'Here's the thing though' which minimally dampens the empathetic opening"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured self-help guide",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance visual warmth, though the text alone is already warm",
      "Provide specific conversation starters for talking to teachers, such as: 'You could say something like: I'm really worried about my grade and want to turn things around. Do you have any advice on what I should focus on?'",
      "The transition 'Here's the thing though' slightly minimizes the validation - consider softer transitions like 'But honestly?' or 'The good news is...'"
