    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation: 'Ugh, I'm so sorry—that freaking out feeling when you lose something important is the absolute worst, like your heart just drops'",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout, especially in advice section: 'I'd start by retracing your steps'",
      "Perfect emoji discipline with single supportive 💙 placed early to set warm tone",
      "Zero bullet points with natural conversational prose flow across four well-sized paragraphs"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question combines two queries ('What was it that you lost, and where were you...') which slightly reduces the natural conversational feel",
      "Could strengthen first-person connection with explicit availability statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk'",
      "Practical advice, while solid, could include one more specific teen-focused tactic like checking the cafeteria or gym lost-and-found specifically"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider simplifying the final question to one focus, such as 'Where do you think you last had it?' to feel more like a natural conversation turn",
      "Add one brief first-person availability statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk through this more' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "Optionally mention specific high-traffic school locations (cafeteria, library, gym) in the advice to make it even more concrete for a teen context"
