    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('It's super common to feel that way, honestly') that normalizes the experience",
      "Ends with an excellent, natural follow-up question ('Did something specific make you think about this...') that invites deeper sharing",
      "Provides realistic, age-appropriate advice about being a 'generalist' and recognizing that passions can still be emerging"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses three bullet points ('Your thing doesn't have to be...', 'Some people are generalists...', 'Your thing could also still be emerging...') instead of flowing prose paragraphs",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - missing 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' makes it feel impersonal despite casual tone",
      "Could use more immediate emotional warmth ('Ugh, that feeling sucks' vs. the more clinical 'It's super common')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question perfectly matches the ideal character - it's natural, specific to the situation, and genuinely invites the teen to share more",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The use of bullet points instead of natural prose paragraphs - this reads more like a self-help article than a text conversation with a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "65%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'But here's something to consider:' followed by three substantial bullet points. This breaks conversational flow and feels structured rather than organic. The content in the bullets should be woven into flowing paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the three bullet points into natural prose by removing the bullet formatting and connecting the ideas with transitions like 'For one thing...' or 'Also...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout, such as 'I think your thing doesn't have to be...' or 'I'd say being a generalist is actually a superpower' to create personal connection",
      "Consider opening with slightly more emotional warmth like 'Ugh, I totally get that feeling' before moving to the validation that it's common"
