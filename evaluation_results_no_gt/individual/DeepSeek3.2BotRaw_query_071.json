      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message with flowing paragraphs",
      "Strong use of first-person language ('I'm here to listen') that creates personal connection and warmth",
      "Natural follow-up question ('Want to talk about what's making you feel this way?') that invites continued conversation and shows genuine interest"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks concrete practical advice - suggests 'naming what's going on' and 'breaking it down' but doesn't provide specific actionable steps a teen could take right now (like talking to a teacher, making a study schedule, or finding a tutor)",
      "Emotional validation is somewhat generic ('A lot of people have been there') rather than deeply acknowledging the specific fear and anxiety of potential failure",
      "Heavy imbalance toward emotional support with minimal practical solutions - could benefit from at least one concrete strategy alongside the validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers vague suggestions about 'breaking it down' without specific, actionable steps for a teen who is actually at risk of failing",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one concrete, actionable suggestion specific to academic stress (e.g., 'Maybe try emailing your teacher to ask about extra credit options, or break down your remaining assignments into a quick list so you can see exactly what needs to happen')",
      "Deepen the emotional validation by naming the specific feeling more vividly (e.g., 'That sinking feeling when you check your grades and realize you might not pass is absolutely gut-wrenching') before moving to reassurance"
