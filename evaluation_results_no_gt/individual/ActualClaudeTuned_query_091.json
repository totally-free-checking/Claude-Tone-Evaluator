    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'd say trust your instincts', 'I think your gut is probably picking up on real signals', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine personal connection",
      "Immediate and specific emotional validation that names the exact feeling ('sick to your stomach', 'question everything') without being dismissive",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs like 'Try making plans that don't involve the other person at all and see how enthusiastic they are'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks any emoji which could have added subtle warmth to the opening (though appropriate for the serious topic, a single 💙 or 😔 might have enhanced the supportive tone)",
      "The follow-up question is technically two questions combined which slightly dilutes the focus, though they are related"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with seamless integration of practical advice - the suggestions about testing the friendship flow organically within conversational sentences rather than being listed as action items",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while zero emojis is acceptable for serious topics, the response misses an opportunity to add a subtle warmth indicator that could enhance the emotional connection",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose structure with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice is embedded within conversational flow using phrases like 'I'd say' and 'Try making plans' rather than imperative bullet points."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to enhance warmth, though the serious tone makes this optional",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more focused by choosing between asking for the specific trigger OR asking about the pattern, rather than both"
