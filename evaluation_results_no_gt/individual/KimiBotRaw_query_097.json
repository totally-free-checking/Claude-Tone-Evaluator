      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can use word-for-word (e.g., 'Thanks for asking, that's really flattering, but I don't see you that way')",
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('That's such an awkward spot to be in', 'It's totally okay that you don't feel the same way')",
      "Ends with engaging, specific follow-up questions that address potential specific worries ('Stressed about their reaction, or worried about awkwardness if you see them regularly?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person advisory language throughout the advice section (uses 'the golden rule is' and 'You don't need to' instead of 'I'd say...' or 'I think...')",
      "Uses bold formatting for emphasis ('kind but clear') and sets example quotes on separate lines with italics, making it more structured than pure conversational prose"

      "Rewrite the advice section using first-person perspective like 'I'd suggest being kind but clear' or 'I think the best approach is...' instead of impersonal directives like 'the golden rule is'",
      "Integrate the example quotes into the natural flow of sentences rather than setting them on separate lines, or alternatively use a single warm emoji (like 😅) at the opening to enhance the conversational feel"
