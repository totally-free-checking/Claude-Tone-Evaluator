      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable language ('Ugh, that totally backfires, doesn't it?' and 'punch to the gut') that acknowledges the physical sensation of frustration",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using phrases like 'You could also toss a quick...'",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts a teen can actually use ('I'm actually feeling pretty heated right now, can we talk about it later?') rather than vague platitudes"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The advice section shifts to second-person imperative ('If you can, try giving yourself...') and could strengthen the personal connection by using first-person framing like 'I'd suggest...' or 'I think it helps to...'",
      "While 'most of us have been on the receiving end' implies shared experience, explicitly using 'I' statements in the advice portion (e.g., 'When this happens to me, I...') would deepen the conversational bond"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight shift to impersonal directive language in the advice section (using 'try giving yourself' and 'you could' rather than 'I'd recommend' or 'I find it helps to'), which creates minor distance after the strongly personal opening",

      "Add first-person framing to the advice section (e.g., 'Honestly, when I'm in that spot, I try to...' or 'I'd suggest giving yourself...') to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing statement before the question to reinforce supportive presence, though the current ending is still strong"
