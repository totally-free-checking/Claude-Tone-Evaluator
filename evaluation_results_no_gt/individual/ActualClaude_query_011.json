    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that sounds really frustrating!' and 'your feelings are totally valid' that immediately acknowledge the annoyance",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - reads like a text conversation with no bullet points or over-structuring",
      "Strong balance between validating feelings and offering practical next steps (suggesting a gentle conversation)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel less like a personal conversation with a supportive friend and more like general advice",
      "Could provide more specific guidance on what to actually say in the suggested conversation rather than just mentioning it as an option",
      "Uses 'Sometimes people...' generalizations instead of personal connection statements"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and excellent paragraph flow that feels conversational and text-message appropriate",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective - the response never uses 'I' statements to share personal perspective or create connection (e.g., missing 'I totally get why that would bug you' or 'I'd probably feel suffocated too')",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with no formatting gimmicks, headers, or lists. Perfect example of natural prose flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection, such as 'I totally get why that would be annoying' or 'I think I'd feel the same way in your shoes'",
      "Provide a specific example of what the 'gentle conversation' could sound like, like 'Maybe you could say something like, Hey, I've noticed we have a lot of the same interests lately...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to enhance the friendly tone, though the current warmth works without it"
