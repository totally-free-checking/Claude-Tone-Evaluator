    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable physical description ('makes your stomach drop') and validating interjection ('Ugh')",
      "Natural first-person supportive closing ('I'm here if you want to vent...') that offers multiple pathways forward without being prescriptive",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero structural elements - reads exactly like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice is somewhat limited to perspective-taking ('brains fill in the blanks') without concrete coping strategies for immediate anxiety",
      "The two questions in sequence ('Are you doing okay? Did you hear...') slightly interrupt the conversational flow, though both are relevant"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and conversational flow - it uses natural paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice dimension could include one specific, actionable technique for managing the immediate anxiety of overhearing gossip, rather than only offering perspective and future options",

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose with three conversational paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or structural formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one concrete grounding technique for immediate anxiety (like 'take three deep breaths' or 'text a friend') before offering the vent/problem-solve options",
      "The double question could be smoothed into one flowing question like 'Are you doing okay, and did you catch what they were actually saying?' to feel more conversational"
