      "Excellent first-person language throughout that creates genuine connection ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I'm so sorry', 'I need a boundary here')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation that normalizes the situation ('liking two people at once doesn't make you a bad person at all') before moving to practical advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance warmth at the opening or closing, though the 'Ugh' effectively serves this purpose",
      "The phrase 'exclusivity expectations' is slightly formal compared to the otherwise casual tone, though still appropriate for the concept"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person perspective that makes the advice feel personal and authentic rather than prescriptive",

      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 after 'Ugh' or 💙 at the end) to visually reinforce the warm, supportive tone for emotional topics",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific - continue using this approach of asking clarifying questions that help you tailor future advice"
