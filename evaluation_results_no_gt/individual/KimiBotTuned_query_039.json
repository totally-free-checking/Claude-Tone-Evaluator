      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable language ('Ugh, that's such a heavy kind of pressure') and normalizes the stress",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use with parents ('I'm trying really hard, but the pressure to be perfect is making me anxious...')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective in the advice section (uses 'it can help' and 'sometimes parents respond' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think')",

      "Add first-person language to the advice section like 'I'd suggest talking to them when...' or 'I think offering a concrete plan helps because...' to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
