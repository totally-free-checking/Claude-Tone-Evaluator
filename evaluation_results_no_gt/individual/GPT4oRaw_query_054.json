    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, making it feel like a real conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I'd appreciate it if you didn't comment on my body') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language when giving advice - uses 'you could try' instead of 'I think you could try' or 'I'd say', making it feel less personal and more like a generic article",
      "Ends with two questions rather than one engaging follow-up, and 'How are you feeling about handling this?' is somewhat generic rather than specific to their situation",
      "Missing casual warmth markers like 'Ugh, that's the worst' or 'We've all been there' - 'frustrating and uncomfortable' feels slightly clinical"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and structure - it flows naturally in paragraphs without any bullet points or over-formatting, reading like a text from a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The impersonal advice delivery - it fails to use first-person recommendations ('I think', 'I'd suggest') and instead uses detached phrasing like 'you could try' and 'it might help', creating distance rather than connection",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or excessive formatting. Advice is integrated naturally into sentences."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language when giving advice - instead of 'you could try addressing it directly,' use 'I think I'd probably just say something directly...' or 'If it were me, I'd say...' to create a personal connection",
      "Replace the double-question ending with one specific question like 'Who's making these comments - is it someone at school or closer to you?' to show genuine interest in their specific situation",
      "Inject more casual warmth at the opening - instead of just 'I'm really sorry,' try 'Ugh, I'm so sorry - that's honestly the worst' to match the teen's emotional intensity"
