    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd pay attention', 'I'd say') which creates genuine connection and avoids impersonal advice-giving",
      "Opens with strong immediate validation ('Ugh, that's the worst kind of guessing game') that acknowledges the emotional confusion before offering solutions",
      "Writes in natural flowing prose without any bullet points or over-formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice realistic for teens ('playfully teasing them about something', 'giving a sincere compliment') rather than vague platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks emojis entirely; while not required, a single subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response could enhance the warm, casual tone for this social/relationship topic",
      "Could slightly extend the emotional validation before transitioning to observational advice—the shift from 'this is super common' to 'I think the best way' happens somewhat quickly",
      "The phrase 'notice a few little things' slightly hints at list-making format, though it thankfully avoids actually creating bullet points"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format combined with consistent first-person language ('I think', 'I'd pay attention') creates an authentic supportive friend voice without any corporate or clinical detachment",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Complete absence of emoji usage misses an opportunity to enhance warmth; for a teen social situation like flirting confusion, one well-placed emoji would strengthen the casual, relatable tone",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs using phrases like 'I'd pay attention to things like...' rather than listing items. Maintains conversational rhythm throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 🤔) early in the response to enhance warmth, particularly for social/relationship topics where visual tone cues help",
      "Extend the validation phase slightly with one more sentence acknowledging the specific anxiety ('That overthinking spiral is exhausting') before transitioning to the 'I think' advice section",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of situational relevance in future responses"
