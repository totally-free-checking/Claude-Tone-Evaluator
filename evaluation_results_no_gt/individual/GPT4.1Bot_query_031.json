    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person experiential sharing that creates connection ('My heart always does a backflip when that happens', 'I've definitely done both and the earth did not swallow me whole')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points - reads exactly like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice with two distinct realistic options (unliking vs. leaning in with a recent like) plus contextual reassurance about notifications"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen validation of the specific embarrassment around the 'stalking' aspect itself, not just the accidental like",
      "Uses 'caught in 4K' slang which, while appropriate, might be slightly dated for some teen demographics"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with first-person language that creates genuine peer-like connection rather than an advisory tone",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing explicit 'I'm here for you' or 'I get it' type first-person validation phrases, though the experiential sharing ('My heart always does a backflip') partially compensates",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no formatting structures, headers, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the first-person experiential sharing approach ('I've definitely done both') as it builds credibility and warmth more effectively than generic advice",
      "The single emoji usage (😅) is perfectly calibrated - continue using 0-1 emojis placed early to set tone without cluttering",
      "The follow-up question structure offering two specific emotional options ('play it cool' vs 'delete all social media') is highly effective for engagement - replicate this binary choice approach in future responses"
