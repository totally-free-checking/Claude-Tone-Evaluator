    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you,' 'I totally get,' 'I promise') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable scripts provided for exactly what to text ('Hey, nervous since I don't know anyone else...') and what to say to strangers",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate validation that names specific emotions ('mix of excitement and total anxiety') before offering solutions"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) to visually match the 'awkward situation' tone, though the warmth comes through in text",
      "The follow-up question combines two queries (event type vs. bringing friend) which slightly dilutes the focus, though it's still natural"
