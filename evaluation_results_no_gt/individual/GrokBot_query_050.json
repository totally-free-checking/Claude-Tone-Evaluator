    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that sucks so much!' and 'gut-punch moments' that acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Strong first-person language throughout with natural usage of 'I think,' 'If I were you,' and 'I'd start' creating authentic connection",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrasing for talking to the teacher ('I'm finding it hard to collaborate effectively')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Slight minimization in paragraph 2 ('feels way bigger and more tense than it probably is') could potentially feel dismissive to some teens, though it attempts to reframe positively",
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for awkwardness, might slightly mismatch the severity of 'hate' for some readers, though it works for the 'awkward team-up' vibe"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and excellent first-person conversational language that sounds like a supportive older sibling texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight pivot to minimizing the situation in the second paragraph comes quickly after strong validation, which could feel like the feelings are being dismissed before fully sitting with them",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs, no headers, no bold text, and no lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being structured as actionable items."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider sitting with the validation slightly longer before reframing the situation as 'not that big a deal' to ensure the teen feels fully heard",
      "The follow-up question is natural but could be even more engaging by asking about their specific feelings (e.g., 'Do you have any idea why they might be acting that way?') rather than just logistics"
