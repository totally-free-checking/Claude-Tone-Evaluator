    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with visceral language ('stomach-knot feeling', 'sets off all your alarms') that captures the emotional weight",
      "Strong first-person advisory voice using 'If I were you, I'd...' and natural contractions throughout, creating authentic peer-like support",
      "Specific actionable scripts ('I'm not trying to control who you date...') and concrete safety planning (code words, rides) appropriate for teen agency"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while conveying awkwardness, may slightly undercut the seriousness of a potential safety concern compared to more neutral/warm options",
      "Could explicitly include 'I'm here if you need to talk' to strengthen the first-person supportive presence, though the follow-up question partially serves this function"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows conversationally through paragraphs using first-person guidance ('I'd focus on', 'I'd also make sure') rather than impersonal directives",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice (😅) for a serious trust concern, which typically signals embarrassment or nervous laughter rather than the gravity of watching a friend potentially enter a harmful relationship",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or structured formatting. Advice is woven naturally into conversational paragraphs with organic transitions between validation, practical guidance, and safety considerations."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😟 or no emoji instead of 😅 for serious safety-adjacent topics to match the emotional gravity, or explicitly acknowledge the seriousness before the emoji",
      "Add an explicit first-person availability statement like 'I'm here to help you figure this out' before the follow-up question to reinforce ongoing support"
