      "Provides concrete, actionable advice that is realistic for a teen's situation (listening, validating, checking in)",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered bullet points and bold headers instead of natural prose conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') and uses impersonal, somewhat formal tone throughout",
      "Missing immediate emotional validation for the user's own feelings of uncertainty about helping their friend"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice provided is specific and realistic for a teen's agency and capabilities",

      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses a numbered list (1-5) with bold headers (Listen, Validate, Check In, Offer Help, Encourage) which dominates the content. The prose is limited to brief intro and outro sentences."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as natural prose paragraphs instead of numbered steps, flowing the suggestions conversationally like 'I'd probably start by just listening without trying to fix everything...'",
      "Add first-person language like 'I get that it's scary when a friend opens up' and 'I'd feel unsure too' to create personal connection",
      "Replace the passive closing invitation with a specific question like 'What did your friend tell you they're struggling with?' or 'How are you feeling about what they shared?'"
