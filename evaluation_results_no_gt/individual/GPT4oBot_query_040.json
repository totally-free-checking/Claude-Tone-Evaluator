      "Opens with immediate validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's such a tough spot to be in') and acknowledges the overwhelming nature of the situation",

      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - relies heavily on second-person 'you' statements which feels slightly less personal/connective",
