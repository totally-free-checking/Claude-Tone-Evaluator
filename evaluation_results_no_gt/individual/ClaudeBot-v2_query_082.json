    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I get that you're looking out for me') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs with specific scripts embedded in sentences",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so annoying' and 'that gross feeling like you're being watched' which normalizes the teen's experience"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could include one more sentence acknowledging the difficulty of the situation before offering solutions",
      "Paragraph 3 is slightly dense with advice; breaking it into two shorter paragraphs might improve readability on mobile without losing the prose format"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with embedded actionable advice - demonstrates how to give concrete scripts ('just talking to a friend from school', 'I get that you're looking out for me...') without resorting to bullet points or lists",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward practical advice over emotional validation - while validation opens the response, the advice section is proportionally longer than the emotional support section",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice is seamlessly woven into conversational prose using phrases like 'If I were you, I'd try...' and 'Sometimes offering a compromise helps too...'"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the excellent first-person perspective usage ('I'd say', 'If I were you') as it creates authentic connection",
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase between the explanation and advice sections to reinforce emotional support before moving to solutions",
      "The follow-up question is excellent - specific, natural, and distinguishes between two different parental motivations"
