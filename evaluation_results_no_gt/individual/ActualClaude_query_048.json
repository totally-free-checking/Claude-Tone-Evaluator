      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's really frustrating!' and matching the user's language ('it sucks')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel slightly impersonal despite the warmth",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: try 'I totally get why that hurts' or 'I'd feel the same way' instead of only using 'you' statements",
      "Include specific scripts or strategies for when comparisons happen, like 'When they start comparing, you could try saying...' or 'Maybe try changing the subject by...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😤 or 😅) early in the response to enhance the casual tone, though the absence isn't problematic"
