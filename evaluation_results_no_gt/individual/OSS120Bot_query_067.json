      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable language like 'Ugh, that feeling' and 'stomach-flip moment' that perfectly captures the teen's anxiety",
      "Uses exactly one well-placed emoji (😅) early in the response to enhance the warm, casual tone without being excessive",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'I'm still figuring out my interests, but I'd love to talk about what options might fit me later'",
      "Maintains pure prose format with zero bullet points, reading like a natural text conversation rather than a structured guide"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person advisory language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' in the advice section; uses 'If you can, try' instead of more personal 'I'd probably try to steer'",
      "Contains slightly generic platitude: 'it won't magically solve everything overnight' which feels less specific than the rest of the response",
      "Could include a closing first-person support statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to strengthen the personal connection"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, maintaining a conversational flow throughout all four paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Limited use of first-person advisory language ('I think', 'I'd say') in the practical advice section, making the suggestions feel slightly less personal than the validation section",

      "Add first-person framing to advice section, e.g., change 'If you can, try steering' to 'I'd suggest trying to steer' or 'I think it helps to steer'",
      "Replace the generic 'it won't magically solve everything overnight' with something more specific like 'the pressure won't disappear completely, but it usually gets easier to handle'",
      "Consider adding a brief first-person closing like 'I'm here if you want to talk through what they say' to reinforce the supportive relationship"
