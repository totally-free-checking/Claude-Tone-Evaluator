      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable language like 'Ughhh' and 'instant stomach-drop moment' that perfectly captures the embarrassment",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Oops—wrong room, my bad' and 'Yeah, I totally mixed up the room') rather than vague advice",

      "Completely lacks first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - uses impersonal generalizations ('it always feels,' 'the smoothest move is') instead of personal perspective",
