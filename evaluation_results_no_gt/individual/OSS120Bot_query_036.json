    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I'm really sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with relatable imagery ('knot in your chest', 'your gut's yelling') and normalization ('most of us have been there')",
      "Provides specific, actionable conversation scripts that are realistic for teens to use ('I noticed X and it made me a little nervous')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while conveying awkwardness, might slightly undercut the seriousness of distrust concerns for some situations, though it fits the 'awkward spot' framing",
      "Could briefly acknowledge why the friend might be blind to red flags (e.g., 'when you're crushing, it's easy to miss...') to further validate the teen's perspective before moving to advice"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - flows like a supportive friend texting, with advice embedded naturally in conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from validation to advice could include one more sentence acknowledging the difficulty of watching a friend potentially get hurt, to strengthen the emotional support before shifting to problem-solving",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or bold text. The response uses four natural paragraphs that flow from validation to advice to engagement, exactly matching the ideal conversational style."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one sentence acknowledging how hard it is to watch a friend potentially make mistakes, deepening the validation before offering the 'gather info' strategy",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be slightly more open-ended (e.g., 'What feels scarier: bringing it up or watching them get hurt?') to invite deeper emotional sharing rather than just cognitive prediction"
