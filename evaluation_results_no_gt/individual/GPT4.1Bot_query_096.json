    },
    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language ('Ugh, that's such a tough feeling', 'I totally get it') that acknowledges the specific pain of feeling isolated while physically present",
      "Excellent use of first-person perspective throughout ('I'd say', 'If I were you', 'I might try') creating genuine connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for conversation ('Hey, sometimes I feel a bit out of the loop, is it just me?') that teens could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense with multiple suggestions (talking to friend, suggesting activities, branching out) which could potentially be overwhelming, though it flows well as prose",
      "Could slightly shorten the transition between normalizing the experience and offering solutions to maintain momentum"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational tone using first-person language ('I totally get it', 'I'd say', 'If I were you') combined with pure prose formatting creates an authentic peer-like connection",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The third paragraph contains three distinct pieces of advice (direct conversation, activity suggestion, branching out) in one block, which slightly risks feeling like a list despite being formatted as prose",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Uses italics for emphasis on 'with' which enhances conversational tone without breaking flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the excellent balance of leading with validation before offering solutions - this creates safety before problem-solving",
      "Consider breaking the advice paragraph into two shorter paragraphs if offering multiple distinct strategies to improve readability on mobile, though the current flow is strong",
      "The follow-up question is perfectly specific ('certain moments where it feels worse') rather than generic - continue using situational questions that show active listening"
