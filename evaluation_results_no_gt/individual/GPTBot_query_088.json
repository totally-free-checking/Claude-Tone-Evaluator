    "strengths": [
      "Opens with validation acknowledging that being ignored by the teacher makes it feel like the room is being told the behavior is 'fine'",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('That's not appropriate,' 'We're not doing that here') and concrete steps like documenting the incident",
      "The follow-up questions at the end are specific to the situation (asking about grade level, target of comment, location) rather than generic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely over-structured with 7 numbered sections, multiple sub-bullets, and headers (###), reading like a legal guide rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I'm here' to create personal connection; uses impersonal instructional tone ('Here are some practical options','You can ask for concrete protections')",
      "Validation is limited to one brief sentence before immediately jumping into a massive action plan; feels like a resource manual rather than emotional support",
      "The follow-up is formatted as a data collection list ('If you tell me: - your grade level...') rather than a natural conversational question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality is strong with specific, realistic suggestions for teens including exact scripts for confronting the situation and reporting it",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is completely misaligned - it uses heavy bullet-point structure with headers and numbered lists instead of natural prose paragraphs, making it feel like a wiki article rather than a supportive text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 25,
      "prose_percentage": "5%",
      "notes": "Response uses 7 major numbered sections with headers (###), extensive bullet points under each section, and a list format for the follow-up question. Only 1-2 sentences at the beginning are in prose form."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 natural prose paragraphs instead of the 7-section guide format - advice should flow conversationally ('I'd probably start by writing down what happened while it's fresh...') rather than as numbered steps",
      "Add first-person connection throughout ('I get how awful that silence feels,' 'I'm here if you need to talk through this,' 'I think you could try saying...') to sound like a supportive friend rather than an instruction manual",
      "Move the follow-up question into the natural flow of text ('What grade are you in? And was the comment directed at you or someone else? I can help you figure out the best way to report this') instead of a bulleted data request"
