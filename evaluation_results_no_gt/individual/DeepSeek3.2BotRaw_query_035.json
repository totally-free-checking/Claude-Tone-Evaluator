    "strengths": [
      "Excellent conversational tone with natural first-person language ('I get it') that sounds like a supportive friend texting",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural elements - flows like natural speech",
      "Strong follow-up question that offers two specific options (talk vs. distraction) showing flexibility and genuine interest"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Too brief for the emotional weight of the situation - only 2 sentences when 2-4 paragraphs would provide more substantial support",
      "Lacks practical advice or concrete strategies for handling the 'trying to act fine' aspect or coping with rejection",
      "Could acknowledge the specific 'acting fine' masking behavior mentioned in the query more directly"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and prose formatting - uses 'Aw,' 'I get it,' and natural contractions perfectly without any corporate or clinical language",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Length and substance - the response is too brief to feel fully supportive for a rejection scenario, functioning more as a conversation opener than a complete supportive response",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or lists. The response flows as a single natural message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand by 1-2 sentences to acknowledge the 'acting fine' part specifically - maybe validate how exhausting it is to pretend you're okay when you're not",
      "Consider adding one small concrete suggestion (like 'it's okay to give yourself permission to be disappointed for a bit') before asking the question",
      "While the lack of emoji is fine, a single supportive emoji like 💙 or 😔 could enhance the warmth given the brevity of the response"
