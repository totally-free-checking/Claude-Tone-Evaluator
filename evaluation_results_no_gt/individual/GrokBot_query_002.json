    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Blahhh, I'm so sorry—that's such a relatable moment! We've all been there') before offering solutions",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to teacher ('I'm really sorry, I totally forgot about this one. Could I turn it in tomorrow...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question uses past tense ('How did it go') which assumes the conversation already happened, though the user just described the moment of forgetting",
      "Could benefit from one emoji (like 😅) to enhance warmth given the casual, relatable nature of the situation, though the absence is acceptable"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and excellent first-person conversational language ('I'd say the best move is...')",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adjusting the follow-up question to present/future tense like 'Are you going to talk to them today?' since the user just described the moment of realizing they forgot",
      "Adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after the opening validation could enhance the casual, friendly tone, though the current text-only approach works well"
