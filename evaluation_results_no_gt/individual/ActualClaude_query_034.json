    "strengths": [
      "Immediate validation with 'Ugh, isn't that the worst?' that instantly connects with the frustration",
      "Relatable hiccuping analogy that explains why 'calm down' is counterproductive in casual, accessible language",
      "Perfect emoji usage (😤) at the end that matches the frustration without being excessive",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points that reads like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I'm here for you' - uses impersonal 'someone who won't hit you' instead of 'I'm here to listen'",
      "Could offer one concrete phrase or strategy for handling the 'calm down' comment in the moment rather than only offering to vent"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The immediate emotional validation and natural prose format that avoids all bullet points and over-structuring",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace 'someone who won't hit you with the dreaded calm down' with 'I'm here to listen without telling you to calm down' to add the missing first-person connection",
      "Consider adding one quick actionable tip like 'Next time, you could try saying \"Telling me to calm down actually has the opposite effect\"' before the venting invitation"
