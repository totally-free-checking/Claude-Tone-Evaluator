    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable conversation scripts the teen can literally use ('Hey, I'm not trying to fight, I just want to understand what changed')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text from a supportive older sibling",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledging feeling 'trapped and kinda powerless'",
      "Natural, specific follow-up questions that show genuine curiosity about the details of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly quick to pivot to explaining parents' perspective ('it usually isn't for no reason') which could potentially feel minimizing, though handled gently",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early on to set tone, though the absence isn't problematic for this serious topic",
      "The balance slightly favors practical advice over emotional support - could use one more sentence of pure validation before the 'If I were you' advice section"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow with consistent first-person language ('I'd try', 'If I were you', 'I'm so sorry') that makes it feel like a real person texting rather than an AI giving instructions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight emphasis on explaining parents' motivations ('it usually isn't for no reason') comes quickly after validation and might feel slightly defensive of the parents, though it does help the teen understand the situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Uses italics for emphasis which enhances conversational tone without breaking flow. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than listed."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure emotional validation between the first and second paragraphs to sit with the feeling longer before explaining parents' perspectives",
      "The phrase 'If I were you' is excellent - keep using this first-person advisory style as it feels much warmer than 'You should'",
      "The follow-up question is perfect - specific and contextual rather than generic 'How are you feeling?' - continue this pattern of asking about concrete details"
