      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'punch to the gut' and 'bestie' that mirrors how teens actually talk",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact scripts ('hey, you've seemed off lately—everything okay?') and concrete actions (send memes, give space)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The perspective shift to 'it usually isn't as personal as it feels' comes quickly and could potentially minimize the hurt feelings, though it does acknowledge the emotional reality",
      "Could benefit from one additional validating sentence before moving to solutions to ensure the teen feels fully heard"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text from an older sibling or friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from emotional validation to practical advice is slightly abrupt; the 'Honestly...' paragraph shifts quickly to perspective-giving rather than sitting with the feelings a moment longer",

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural conversational paragraphs with no headers, bold text, or list structures. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one more sentence of pure validation before the 'it isn't personal' reframing to ensure the teen feels fully seen in their hurt feelings",
      "Consider varying sentence structure slightly in the advice paragraph to maintain the conversational rhythm, though the current flow is strong"
