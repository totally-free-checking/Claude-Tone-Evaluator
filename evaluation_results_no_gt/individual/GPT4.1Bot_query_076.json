      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's honestly such a tough feeling' and 'I totally get what you mean' that makes the teen feel immediately heard",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd', 'I totally get') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no structural formatting or lists"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to enhance the warm tone, though the absence doesn't significantly detract",
      "The transition from validation to advice with 'But honestly' could be slightly softer with one more sentence of validation before offering the perspective shift"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - maintains perfect paragraph structure without any bullet points, headers, or over-formatting while using casual, first-person language throughout",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😊) after the opening validation to visually reinforce the supportive tone for this emotionally vulnerable topic",
      "The advice to 'mess around with different clubs, hobbies, or even weird internet rabbit holes' is excellent and specific - maintain this level of concrete, low-pressure suggestions in future responses"
