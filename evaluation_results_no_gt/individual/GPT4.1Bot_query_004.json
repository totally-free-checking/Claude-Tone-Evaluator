    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, strong emotional validation: 'Ugh, that's honestly one of the worst feelings' and acknowledges the 'spiraling' anxiety",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout: 'If I were in your shoes,' 'I totally get,' and 'I might send' creates genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script teens can actually use: 'Hey, you've seemed kinda quiet lately, is everything cool?'",
      "Maintains perfect prose format with zero bullet points, headers, or over-formatting—reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The pivot to reassurance ('it's about something going on with them, not you') comes quickly; could linger slightly longer on validating the anxiety before problem-solving",
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for the context, slightly interrupts the empathetic flow of the opening validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational first-person language that flows like texting with a supportive older sibling or friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Could deepen initial emotional validation for one more sentence before moving to the 'it's probably not about you' reassurance",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using specific scripts like 'Hey, you've seemed kinda quiet lately, is everything cool?' as they give teens exact words to use in difficult conversations",
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure validation ('That uncertainty is so hard to sit with') before pivoting to reassurance that it's not their fault",
      "The follow-up question about text vs. in-person behavior is excellent and specific—keep asking situation-specific questions that show genuine curiosity about their experience"
