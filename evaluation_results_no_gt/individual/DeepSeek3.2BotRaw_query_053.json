    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('That's really frustrating') and acknowledges the emotional impact of feeling undervalued",
      "Acknowledges possible underlying reasons like anxiety or overwhelm, showing nuanced understanding of teen social dynamics",
      "Appropriate length that doesn't overwhelm - readable in a quick phone glance"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bulleted list of three questions in the middle which breaks conversational flow and feels like an interrogation rather than a chat",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Ends with a statement rather than a follow-up question, and asks multiple questions at once which can feel overwhelming",
      "Advice is vague and circular ('Once you figure out the why, you can decide how to talk to them') without specific phrases or concrete steps"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Length and conciseness - the response is appropriately sized for a phone screen and doesn't ramble or repeat itself",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the use of a bulleted list for follow-up questions is heavily structured and deviates significantly from the conversational paragraph format ideal",

      "prose_percentage": "65%",
      "notes": "Response uses a bulleted list for the follow-up questions section, which creates a structured, survey-like feel rather than natural conversation. The bullets contain substantial text, making this a significant portion of the response."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bulleted questions into natural prose or a single conversational question like 'I'm curious - is this a new thing or has it been happening for a while? And do they usually explain why?'",
      "Add first-person language throughout, such as 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd suggest starting by...' to create a personal connection",
      "Provide specific example phrases the teen could actually use, like 'Hey, I've noticed you've had to cancel a few times lately and I'm feeling a bit disconnected - is everything okay?'",
      "Move the question to the very end of the response and limit it to one engaging question rather than three at once"
