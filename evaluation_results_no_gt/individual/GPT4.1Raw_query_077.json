    "strengths": [
      "Uses natural prose format throughout without any bullet points or over-structuring, reading as continuous text",
      "Appropriately acknowledges the weight of the situation with 'carrying something important' and includes responsible safety guidance about seeking help"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout the advice section - uses impersonal phrasing like 'it might be a good idea' and 'just know it's okay' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest'",
      "Ends with a statement ('I'm here to listen') rather than an engaging follow-up question to continue the conversation, and the one question present ('Are you feeling worried...') is generic and placed in the middle"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace impersonal advice phrases like 'it might be a good idea to' with first-person language like 'I think you should' or 'I'd probably talk to' to create a warmer, more personal connection",
      "End with a specific, engaging question rather than a statement - for example: 'What kind of secret is it, if you feel comfortable sharing? Or is it more that you're worried about your friend?'",
      "Add more immediate emotional warmth at the opening with phrases like 'Ugh, that's such a heavy thing to carry' or 'That sinking feeling when you know something big' before moving to the practical safety advice"
