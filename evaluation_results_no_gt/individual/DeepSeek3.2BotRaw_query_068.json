      "Opens with strong validation and first-person empathy: 'Hey, I'm really sorry you're going through that' immediately acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use: 'I’ve been feeling a bit unsure about my standing in your class lately. Is there anything I can do to improve?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered list format (5 bullets) with bold headers like '**Teachers are human too**' creates a structured, article-like feel rather than conversational flow",
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice section - uses impersonal directives like 'Consider talking to...' and 'Have you noticed...' instead of 'I'd suggest...' or 'I wonder if you've noticed...'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic steps including exact phrases the teen can say and acknowledges the teacher's perspective without dismissing the teen's feelings",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - uses 'A few thoughts that might help:' followed by 5 numbered items, which reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive text conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the numbered list into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice together naturally, using transitions like 'I wonder if maybe...' or 'Another thing to consider is...'",
      "Infuse the advice sections with first-person language throughout, such as 'I'd suggest checking whether...' or 'I think it might help to consider...' to maintain the conversational, personal tone established in the opening"
