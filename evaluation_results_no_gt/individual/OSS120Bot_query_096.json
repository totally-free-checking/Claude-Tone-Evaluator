      "Excellent emotional validation with specific, relatable descriptions of the feeling ('weird, hollow feeling when you're right there but somehow still on the outside')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I've been kinda quiet lately, what's been happening with you?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language when giving advice (uses imperative 'try nudging' instead of 'I'd suggest nudging' or 'I think you could try')",
      "Minor grammar error ('a activity' instead of 'an activity')",
      "Follow-up question is slightly compound (asks two things at once) rather than a single focused question"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to the advice section (e.g., 'I'd probably try nudging...' or 'I think you could say...') to make it feel more like personal advice from a friend rather than instructions",
      "Fix the grammar error: change 'joining a activity' to 'joining an activity'",
      "Consider making the final question singular and more focused (e.g., 'What's been happening lately that makes you feel most left out?') rather than the compound question"
