      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual interjections ('Argh, that's so draining') and mirrors the user's frustration with 'you just need to breathe'",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately...') rather than vague advice about 'communicating better'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows naturally like a text conversation with natural paragraph breaks"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate slightly more first-person language like 'I totally get that' or 'I think you're handling this well' to strengthen the personal connection (currently relies mainly on 'I'd probably do')",
      "The 😅 emoji works for the awkwardness of the situation, but a 💙 or 😊 might convey more warmth for a potentially stressful friendship conflict"
