    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry — that's *so* frustrating' and 'you're not being dramatic for being mad' that immediately normalizes the teen's anger and feelings of being singled out",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd', 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection that feels like a real person rather than generic advice",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually say to their teacher ('Hey, can I ask why my seat got moved? I work better when I'm not stressed about it') making the advice immediately actionable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While the warmth is strong through text alone, adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) could enhance the visual warmth, though this is a minor preference rather than a significant flaw"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format that flows like texting with a supportive older sibling, completely avoiding bullet points or over-structuring while maintaining perfect readability on a phone",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of any emoji, while acceptable for the serious tone, slightly misses an opportunity to add visual warmth that could enhance the already strong emotional connection",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within conversational sentences rather than being listed out, reading exactly like a supportive text message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 after 'frustrating' or 💙 at the close) to enhance visual warmth, though the current text-only approach is still very effective",
      "Continue using the excellent first-person advisory style ('If I were you, I'd') seen here, as it creates strong personal connection while delivering practical guidance"
