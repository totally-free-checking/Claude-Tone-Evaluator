    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'I'd start by', 'I think') creating genuine connection",
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using relatable teen expressions ('Ugh', 'hits the emergency brake') before offering solutions",
      "Specific actionable advice tailored to teen executive function challenges (picking least painful task, 25-minute timer, small wins)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) to enhance visual warmth, though the absence is not problematic for this serious/stressed tone",
      "Validation paragraph is brief; could slightly expand on acknowledging how paralyzing assignment pile-up feels before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💪) early in the response to enhance warmth if desired, though the current text-only approach works for the stressed tone",
      "The follow-up question is good, but you could deepen validation first by asking 'Is it that you can't decide where to start, or just feeling totally drained?' before asking which assignment"
