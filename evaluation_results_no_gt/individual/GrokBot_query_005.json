    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd start by...', 'I'd keep it chill', 'I promise') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and acknowledging specific feelings of being 'exposed and helpless'",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen can use ('Nah, that's not true at all – weird how stuff like that gets twisted')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reassurance that 'it's not as big a deal to everyone else as it seems in your head' could potentially minimize the teen's current emotional experience, even though well-intentioned",
      "Could include slightly more emotional validation before transitioning to the practical advice section, as the second paragraph moves quickly to perspective-giving"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational first-person voice - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no structural formatting and authentic use of 'I' statements throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight minimization in paragraph 2 where it suggests the situation isn't 'as big a deal to everyone else,' which risks dismissing the teen's feelings despite the supportive intent",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using phrases like 'If I were you, I'd start by...' rather than listing steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure emotional validation between paragraphs 1 and 2 before offering the perspective that rumors die down, to ensure the teen feels fully heard before receiving reassurance",
      "The follow-up question is excellent, but you could make it even more specific by asking how the rumor is affecting their day-to-day or who they've talked to about it so far"
