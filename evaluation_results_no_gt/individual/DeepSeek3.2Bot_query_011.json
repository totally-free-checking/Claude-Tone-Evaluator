      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that is so annoying!') and uses a relatable metaphor ('like that one part of a song getting stuck on repeat')",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I think having a quiet, kind chat') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Haha, are you my fashion clone now?') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions back-to-back ('How long has this been going on? Is it like...') rather than a single focused question",
      "Could slightly strengthen the 'you're not alone' validation with explicit 'we've all been there' language, though 'I get why' covers it well"

      "Combine the two final questions into one flowing question like 'How long has this been going on—is it everything from your haircut to the shows you watch?' or just choose one to avoid feeling like an interrogation",
      "Consider adding one brief 'this is super common' validation to reinforce they're not alone, though the current validation is strong"
