      "Immediate emotional validation with authentic teen-appropriate language ('Ugh, that is the absolute worst' and 'invasive and just... draining')",
      "Specific, actionable script provided for boundary-setting ('Hey, I don't appreciate comments about my body. Please don't make them')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more first-person connection phrases like 'I get it' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' to strengthen the personal bond",
      "The transition to advice could use slightly more first-person framing such as 'I think the best approach would be...' rather than jumping to 'If you feel safe doing so'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - the response flows as conversational paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, perfectly matching the ideal of texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language usage, while present ('I'm so sorry', 'I'd try'), could be enhanced with more explicit 'I think' or 'I get it' type phrases to make the advice feel more personally connected rather than instructional",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent adherence to prose-only format. The response uses natural paragraph breaks that follow conversational logic rather than structural formatting. No bold text, headers, or list formatting detected."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one explicit first-person connection phrase like 'I get how exhausting that must be' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' to reinforce that this is a personal conversation, not generic advice",
      "Consider framing the advice section with 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' to maintain the first-person perspective throughout rather than shifting to purely second-person instructional mode"
