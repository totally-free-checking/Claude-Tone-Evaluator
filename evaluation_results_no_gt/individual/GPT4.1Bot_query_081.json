    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were in your shoes, I'd', 'I just want to sleep') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with an older sibling",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrasing to use ('Hey, I'm usually asleep by 11...') and realistic phone settings (Do Not Disturb)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing emoji opportunity where one could enhance warmth (like 😴 or 😅) given the exhaustion/frustration topic",
      "Could slightly deepen validation about the social pressure aspect (worrying about seeming rude or missing inside jokes) before jumping to solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no corporate structure or bullet points",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while not terrible, the complete absence misses an opportunity to add visual warmth to match the verbal empathy, especially given the casual teen context",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose structure with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😴 or 😅) early in the response to match the casual, empathetic tone",
      "Could expand slightly on validating the social anxiety aspect - teens often worry that muting a friend might hurt their feelings or cause FOMO"
