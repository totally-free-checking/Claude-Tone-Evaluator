    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text message",
      "Uses casual language and contractions appropriately (\"mess with your mind,\" \"easier said than done\") creating a relaxed, friendly vibe",
      "Provides realistic, age-appropriate distraction suggestions (favorite show, friends, hobby) that teens can actually do"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - the response just stops without inviting the teen to share more",
      "Lacks first-person perspective throughout - uses imperative advice (\"Give yourself,\" \"Maybe shift\") instead of \"I think\" or \"I'd suggest\" which creates distance rather than connection",
      "Invalidates the spiraling feeling too quickly with \"But try not to let it mess with your mind too much\" before fully sitting with the emotional weight"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with two natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a specific follow-up question at the end like \"Have they done this before, or is this out of character?\" or \"What were you hoping they'd say?\" to keep the conversation going",
      "Replace imperative advice with first-person language like \"I'd probably try to distract myself with...\" or \"I think giving yourself permission to breathe first helps...\" to sound more like a supportive friend sharing experience",
      "Validate the spiraling feeling more fully before reframing - instead of \"try not to let it mess with your mind,\" try \"That spiral is so real - I've definitely stared at my phone waiting for the typing bubble to appear\" before offering the perspective shift"
