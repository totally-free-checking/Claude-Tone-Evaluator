    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's such a heavy spot' and acknowledging the physical feeling of anxiety ('in your chest')",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts for exactly what to say to the friend in different scenarios (danger-level vs. serious-but-not-dangerous)",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language and personal connection - doesn't use 'I think,' 'I'd feel,' or 'I'm here' to create a sense of the bot being present with them; relies heavily on 'you' statements and impersonal constructions",
      "Could benefit from slightly more explicit 'I'm here to help' or 'I've got your back' type reassurance to strengthen the supportive relationship"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column, with advice embedded naturally within sentences rather than listed out",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Impersonal voice - the response avoids using first-person perspective ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') which creates slight distance rather than the intimate, supportive presence of someone sharing the moment with them",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose with four flowing paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice is woven into narrative sentences rather than broken out into steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection, such as 'I think you're being a really good friend by taking this seriously' or 'I'd feel so torn in your shoes too' to make it feel like someone is personally supporting them, not just dispensing advice",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk more' or similar closing reassurance before the follow-up question to reinforce that this is an ongoing supportive conversation"
