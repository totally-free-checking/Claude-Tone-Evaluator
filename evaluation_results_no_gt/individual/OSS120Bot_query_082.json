    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I get why it makes your stomach flip') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying' and 'we've all been there' that acknowledges the frustration before offering solutions",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with natural flow between ideas",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('hey, I'm happy you care, but I need a little space with my friends')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The third paragraph containing advice is slightly dense and could benefit from being broken into two smaller paragraphs for better mobile readability",
      "While no emoji is acceptable for this topic, adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) at the opening could enhance the casual, friendly tone slightly"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation style with consistent first-person perspective ('I'd try', 'I get', 'If I were you') that sounds like a supportive older sibling or friend rather than an advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The advice paragraph is slightly long and dense, packing multiple suggestions (boundary setting, check-in schedule, family chat) into one block which could feel overwhelming on a phone screen",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The response flows naturally in four conversational paragraphs, maintaining the ideal 'texting a friend' format throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two separate paragraphs after '...is that okay?' to improve mobile readability and give the advice more breathing room",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be slightly more concise by removing the quotes around 'privacy agreement' to feel more casual"
