    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get how that can...', 'I'd say start by...') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use verbatim ('Hey, I appreciate you asking, but I'm not comfortable with that, so I'm gonna pass')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji choice (😔) while appropriate, is slightly heavy; a 💙 or 😊 might offer more warmth while acknowledging the difficulty",
      "Could slightly expand on the emotional complexity of friend pressure specifically (fear of losing friendship) before jumping to 'the good news'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational first-person advice delivery - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor emoji choice could be slightly more warm/supportive rather than sad-focused, though this is a nitpick",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using a heart or supportive emoji (💙) instead of or alongside the sad face to balance validation with encouragement",
      "Could add one more sentence acknowledging how hard it is specifically to disappoint friends before offering the 'good news' about real friendships"
