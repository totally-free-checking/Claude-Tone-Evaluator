    "strengths": [
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I’ve realized I need to step away from [activity]. My last day will be [date]...')",
      "Ends with a strong, specific follow-up question that invites continuation: 'If you tell me what the activity is... and why you feel guilty, I can help you craft the exact message'",
      "Distinguishes between types of guilt (moral vs boundary) which shows sophisticated understanding of the emotional nuance"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - reads as impersonal advice rather than a supportive friend connecting",
      "Over-structured format with headers (## 1), numbered sections, and bullet points makes it feel like a wikiHow article rather than a text conversation",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping into solutions - only one brief sentence acknowledging feelings before 5 sections of practical advice",
      "Missing warm, conversational openings like 'Ugh, that guilt is the worst' or 'We've all been there' that would make a teen feel truly seen"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, immediately usable scripts and considers teen limitations (notice periods, not over-explaining)",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses heavy formatting with headers, numbered lists, and bullet points instead of conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses headers (## 1 through ## 5), multiple bullet lists under each section, bold text for emphasis, and structured scripts. Reads like a self-help guide rather than a supportive message. Only the opening paragraph and closing sentence are in prose format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite in conversational paragraphs without headers or bullet points - flow the advice naturally as if texting a friend ('I'd start by figuring out what kind of guilt this is...')",
      "Add first-person language throughout ('I get how heavy that guilt feels', 'I'd probably ask myself...', 'I'm here to help you figure this out') to create connection",
      "Move the warm validation to the forefront and sustain it throughout - validate the feeling of guilt before diving into the 'sorting out' phase, and check in emotionally between advice points",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early on to soften the clinical tone, or keep it at zero but compensate with warmer language"
