    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that can totally feel awkward and uncomfortable' and 'It's okay not to click with everyone'",
      "Very specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use like 'Hey, I really appreciate the effort you're making, but I'm keeping things low-key right now'",
      "Appropriate casual language using teen-relevant terms like 'vibe' and 'totally' without being cringe"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered bullet points with bold headers instead of natural prose paragraphs, making it read like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Complete absence of follow-up question at the end - closes with a statement rather than engaging the user to continue the conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making the advice feel impersonal rather than like a supportive friend sharing perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides concrete, realistic strategies with specific wording examples that a teen could actually use immediately",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses four numbered bullet points with bold formatting headers which is the opposite of the conversational paragraph style ideal",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses a numbered list (1-4) with bold headers (Set Boundaries, Be Polite but Distant, etc.) for the majority of the content. Only the opening and closing sentences are prose. This creates a structured, listicle format rather than flowing conversational text."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the middle section as natural prose paragraphs instead of numbered bullets - integrate the advice into a flowing conversation like 'If they keep pushing, I think it's okay to gently let them know... You could say something like...'",
      "Add an engaging follow-up question at the end such as 'Have they been crossing any specific boundaries that feel extra uncomfortable?' or 'What do you think is making the vibe feel off?'",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout to create connection, like 'I get how awkward that feels' or 'I'd probably try to keep conversations short and sweet' instead of imperative commands"
