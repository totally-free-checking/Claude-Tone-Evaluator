    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh no, the dreaded accidental deep-like!') and normalizes the experience ('happens to literally everyone','We've all been there')",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice tailored to teen social media behavior (unliking quickly, platform-specific notification behavior, the 'cover-up' strategy)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think','I'd say','I get it') - uses impersonal 'you could' and imperative statements instead of conversational friend-to-friend advice",
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers ('Damage control options:', 'Reality check:') instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Ends with no follow-up question to continue the conversation - just a closing statement"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The emotional validation and normalization of the 'deep-like' anxiety - successfully makes the teen feel less alone in an embarrassing moment",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting structure - uses bullet points with bold headers like a self-help article rather than flowing conversational prose",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'Damage control options:' followed by three bullet points with bold headers (Unlike immediately, Don't mention it, The cover-up), then 'Reality check:' section. This reads like a wikiHow article rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice section as natural prose instead of bullet points - e.g., 'If I were you, I'd unlike it immediately since the notification often disappears if you're fast enough. Then I'd just not mention it at all...'",
      "Add a follow-up question at the end to invite continued conversation, such as 'How old was the post you liked?' or 'Is this someone you still see at school?'",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout ('I think the best move is...', 'I get why you're panicking...') to create the feeling of talking to a supportive friend rather than reading an article"
