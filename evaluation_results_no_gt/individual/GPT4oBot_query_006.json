    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry, that feeling is the worst' and specific empathy about replaying questions in your head",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with natural transitions like 'But honestly'",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I totally get', 'I'd say' implied in tone) creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, situation-aware follow-up question asking whether it was one part or the whole test that was difficult"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could provide slightly more specific guidance on how to approach the teacher conversation (e.g., specific phrasing to use)",
      "The 😅 emoji choice, while warm, slightly mismatches the panic context - it conveys nervous laughter/embarrassment better than anxiety/panic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no structural formatting or bullet points",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Could offer more specific scripting for the teacher conversation advice - currently mentions 'talking to your teacher' but doesn't give concrete language a nervous teen could use",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent natural paragraph structure with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Uses italics sparingly for emphasis ('worst') which enhances rather than disrupts the conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a specific script for approaching the teacher, such as: 'You could try saying something like, \"I know I struggled with X section - is there any way I can show you I understand the material?\"'",
      "While the 😅 works, consider 😓 or 😟 for panic situations, or simply omitting the emoji since the text already conveys warmth strongly through words alone"
