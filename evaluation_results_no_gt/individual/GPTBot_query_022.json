    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts and phrases the teen can actually use in the moment (e.g., 'Ouch. Not funny to me,' 'What did you mean by that?')",
      "Ends with highly engaging, specific follow-up questions that show genuine interest in tailoring the advice further ('What kinds of 'jokes' are they making... Do they do it one-on-one or mostly around others?')",
      "Acknowledges realistic friendship dynamics like the 'you're too sensitive' deflection and the importance of watching their reaction to gauge the friendship"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses impersonal 'you can' and 'these tend to be' instead of 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get how much that hurts'",
      "Over-structured with headers (###), multiple bullet lists, and a numbered 1-5 list that reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Missing immediate emotional warmth - starts with analysis ('it's totally reasonable') rather than empathetic validation ('Ugh, that's such a gut-punch feeling' or 'I'm sorry, that's so uncomfortable')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question engagement is exemplary - it asks specific contextual questions about the situation and offers to help craft a personalized response, showing genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is extremely over-structured with headers, bullet points, and numbered lists throughout, making it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses multiple headers (###), extensive bullet lists under 'A quick gut-check' and 'What you can do,' and a numbered 1-5 list. The advice is delivered as structured steps rather than flowing prose. Only the final paragraph and opening sentence are in paragraph form."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in conversational paragraphs without headers or bullet points - instead of '### What you can do (in order of least to most intense)' followed by numbered steps, try 'I'd probably start with something small in the moment, like just saying 'ouch' or 'not funny to me.' If that doesn't work, maybe try asking them what they meant by it...'",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout - replace 'it's totally reasonable to treat them as insults' with 'I get why that stings so much - when someone hides insults behind 'just joking,' it feels so invalidating'",
      "Move the emotional validation to the very beginning before any advice, and use warmer language like 'Ugh, that's such a sinking feeling when a friend does that' rather than starting with analytical definitions"
