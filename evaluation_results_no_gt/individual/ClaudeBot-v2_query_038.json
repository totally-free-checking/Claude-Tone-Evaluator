    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd start', 'I'm so sorry', 'I feel behind') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable specifics ('That \"I'm behind\" feeling is so real', 'even the ones acting confident')",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact scripting for talking to counselors ('literally say, \"I feel behind and I don't know what I should be taking\"')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The word 'non-negotiable' is slightly formal compared to the otherwise casual tone (could use 'must-take' or 'required')",
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) to enhance the 'scrambling' sentiment, though the absence is not problematic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting used. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider replacing 'non-negotiable' with more casual phrasing like 'the stuff you absolutely have to take' to maintain the conversational flow",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; keeping this level of targeted curiosity is perfect for continuing the conversation"
