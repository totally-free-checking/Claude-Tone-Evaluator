    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a real conversation with a supportive friend",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try,' 'I'm really sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact breathing technique (inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6) and concrete examples like 'emailing a teacher to ask for an extension'",
      "Perfect emoji usage with single 💙 placed early to set warm tone without being excessive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The medical safety paragraph, while necessary and responsibly included, shifts slightly toward clinical language compared to the casual warmth of the rest of the response",
      "The third paragraph is quite long and contains multiple suggestions which could potentially feel overwhelming, though the prose format helps it flow"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - completely avoids bullet points and structured lists, maintaining conversational paragraph flow throughout while still organizing advice clearly",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two smaller paragraphs after the breathing exercise suggestion to improve readability on mobile devices",
      "The medical warning is handled well but could be slightly softened with a phrase like 'I don't want to worry you, but...' to maintain the warm tone while still covering safety"
