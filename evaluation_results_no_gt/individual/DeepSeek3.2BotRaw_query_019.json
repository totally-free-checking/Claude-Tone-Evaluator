    "strengths": [
      "The follow-up question is natural and engaging: 'How did it happen, if you don't mind me asking? Sometimes knowing the context can help you figure out the best way to address it.' This invites the teen to share more without pressure",
      "Practical advice is realistic and actionable for a teen's agency, suggesting specific steps like asking to speak privately, showing notes/drafts, and explaining their study process rather than generic platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered bullet points (4 items with bold headers) instead of conversational prose. The phrase 'Here are some things you might consider doing:' followed by a list reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive text from a friend",
      "Complete lack of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it'). The response uses impersonal directives like 'It's important not to get defensive' and 'Here are some things you might consider' rather than personal connection"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question quality - it ends with a natural, specific question that shows genuine curiosity about the context and invites continued conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose vs bullet formatting - the response uses a heavily structured numbered list with bold headers which completely breaks the conversational flow and feels like a formal guide rather than supportive messaging",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "45%",
      "notes": "Response uses a 4-item numbered list with bold headers (e.g., '**Stay calm and respectful.**') which dominates the middle section. The transition 'Here are some things you might consider doing:' is explicitly flagged as a red flag in the ideal character profile. Advice should flow naturally within paragraphs rather than being listed out"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice section as natural prose using first-person perspective: 'If I were in your shoes, I'd start by staying calm and asking to speak privately. I'd explain exactly how I studied and show any notes or drafts I had...'",
      "Add immediate emotional warmth and first-person validation upfront: 'Ugh, that's such a sinking feeling! I totally get why you'd be stressed - being accused of something you didn't do is so unfair, especially when you actually put in the work.'",
      "Remove the 'Here are some things you might consider doing:' framing entirely - this signals a formal advice column rather than a supportive conversation"
