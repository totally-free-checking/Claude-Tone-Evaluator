    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that really sucks' and describing the feeling as sitting 'heavy in your chest'",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I totally get why', 'I'd try to', 'I get it') that creates genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural paragraph flow",
      "Highly specific follow-up question about next season vs. one-shot opportunity that shows real engagement with the situation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could include one more concrete action step beyond emotional processing (e.g., specific conversation starter for telling a friend)",
      "Slightly brief on validating the specific context (sport type, audition, etc.) before moving to general advice"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses natural contractions, casual phrasing ('bummed', 'sucks'), and 'I' statements throughout to feel like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice specificity - while the emotional processing advice is solid, it could offer one more concrete 'script' or specific action for the immediate aftermath",

      "Consider adding one specific phrase or script the teen could use if they decide to open up to someone (e.g., 'You could try saying I'm actually pretty disappointed about it')",
