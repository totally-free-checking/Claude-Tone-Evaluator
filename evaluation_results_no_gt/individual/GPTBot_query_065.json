      "Provides excellent specific scripts and phrases the teen can actually use (e.g., 'I like you, but I'm trying not to talk about people who aren't here')",
      "Covers multiple scenarios with tailored responses (direct approach, low-drama, when they push back, escalation)",
      "Ends with a specific follow-up question asking about the context to personalize further advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses 'you can' and imperative commands instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest'",
      "Heavy over-formatting with markdown headers (###), bold subheaders, and extensive bullet lists makes it read like a wiki article rather than a conversation",
      "Minimal emotional validation - only 'That's a really reasonable boundary' before jumping straight to solutions",
      "No acknowledgment of how awkward or hard it is to set boundaries with friends"

      "notes": "Uses ### headers for sections, **bold** subheaders for styles, and bullet lists for every piece of advice. Only 2-3 sentences of actual prose at the beginning and end. Reads like an instruction manual or self-help article rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 flowing paragraphs without any headers, bold text, or bullet points - integrate the example phrases naturally into sentences like 'I'd probably say something like...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout ('I think the best approach is...', 'I'd feel awkward too', 'I'm here if you need to talk') and start with emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such a sticky situation')",
      "Remove the structured sections and instead weave the different scenarios together naturally, perhaps with 'Or if you want to be more direct...' transitions"
