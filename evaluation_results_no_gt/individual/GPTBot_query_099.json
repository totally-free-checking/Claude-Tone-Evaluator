      "Provides excellent specific actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I feel really violated and unsafe writing when my diary is read...')",
      "Includes important safety considerations for teens in controlling or unsafe home environments (point 6 about prioritizing safety over confrontation)",
      "Asks specific follow-up questions about age and safety to tailor further advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with 6 numbered points, bold headers, and multiple sub-bullet lists instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd feel', 'I'm here') - reads like an impersonal advice article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Jumps to practical solutions after only one sentence of emotional validation, creating an imbalanced 90% advice / 10% support ratio"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, specific strategies including password-protected apps, locked boxes, and mediation options that acknowledge teen agency limitations",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - uses heavy bullet-point structure with bold headers and numbered lists that feels like a wikiHow article rather than a texting conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 16,
      "prose_percentage": "10%",
      "notes": "Response contains 6 main numbered points with bold headers (e.g., 'Ground yourself first', 'Decide what you want from them') and approximately 10 sub-bullets. Only 2-3 sentences at the beginning and end are in prose format. This is the opposite of the ideal conversational paragraph style."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the entire response as 2-3 natural paragraphs without any numbered lists or bold headers - flow the advice naturally within sentences",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout such as 'I can't imagine how violated you must feel,' 'I'd be devastated if that happened to me,' or 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with this'",
      "Spend more time on emotional validation before offering solutions - aim for at least 40% validation/support before moving to practical advice",
      "Remove structured headers like 'Ground yourself first' and instead weave those concepts into conversational sentences like 'First, I'd try to ground yourself...'"
