    "strengths": [
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use like 'Just chatting with [friend's name] about school stuff!' and 'Someone from class — don't worry, no secrets!'",
      "Opens with immediate validation ('Totally get that feeling') and acknowledges the dynamic as a 'classic parent move' which normalizes the experience",
      "Uses casual, age-appropriate language throughout ('chill options', 'nosy', 'you've got this') without sounding forced"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers (**If you're okay with answering:**, etc.) makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a conversational text; six separate bullet points break natural flow",
      "Completely lacks a follow-up question at the end to continue the conversation; closes with a statement ('you've got this') rather than engaging the user",
      "Uses four emojis (😅, 😄, 💬, ✨) which exceeds the ideal 0-1 max and feels slightly excessive, especially the two at the very end"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, categorized response scripts that are realistic for a teen to use in the moment",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the response is structured with headers and six bullet points instead of flowing conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bolded section headers with two bullet points each, creating a very structured, listicle format. The advice is delivered entirely through bullet lists rather than integrated into natural sentences."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation, such as 'I think keeping it light works best if you're okay sharing a bit — maybe just say you're chatting with a friend about school...' instead of using headers and lists",
      "End with a specific, engaging question to continue the dialogue like 'Do you think they're asking because they're worried about something specific, or is it just random curiosity?'",
      "Reduce emoji usage to 0-1 (probably just the 😅 at the beginning) and incorporate more first-person language like 'I'd probably say something like...' to make it feel more personal"
