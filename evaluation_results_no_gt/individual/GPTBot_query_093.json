    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts/lines to use like 'Thanks—I'm trying something new' and 'Not looking for opinions, but noted' that give teens concrete tools",
      "Ends with a strong follow-up question asking specifically about 'what kind of change' and 'who you're most worried about', showing genuine interest in their specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Response relies heavily on 6 bullet points with bold headers instead of natural prose paragraphs, reading like a self-help article",
      "Completely lacks first-person language (no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I'm here'), making the advice feel impersonal rather than like a friend texting",
      "Only provides one brief sentence of emotional validation ('That fear makes a lot of sense') before immediately jumping to structured advice lists"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that naturally weave the advice into conversation instead of listing them out",
      "Add first-person language throughout such as 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I totally get that spotlight feeling' to create a personal connection with the teen",
      "Expand the opening validation to 2-3 sentences before offering solutions, and reduce the number of advice points to focus on the most important ones"
