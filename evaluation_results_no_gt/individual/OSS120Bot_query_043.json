      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get how uncomfortable it is', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",

      "Could slightly deepen validation of the specific betrayal/suspicion feelings before normalizing with 'most of us have been there'",

      "Could ask one clarifying question earlier about what specifically made them think the friend is lying, to help tailor the advice further"
