    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points, maintaining natural conversational flow throughout the response",
      "Strong opening validation using 'we've all been there' and acknowledging that pressure affects everyone",
      "Practical advice is specific and teen-appropriate, suggesting realistic actions like talking to teachers about retakes and immediate self-care (walks, snacks)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No follow-up question at the end to continue the conversation - closes with 'Hang in there' instead of engaging the user further",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes the response feel slightly impersonal despite being warm",
      "Could provide slightly more immediate validation of the specific panic feeling before moving to reassurance"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "End with a specific question like 'What section tripped you up the most?' or 'Have you talked to anyone else about how you're feeling?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Add first-person perspective such as 'I totally get that sinking feeling when you walk out of a test' or 'I'd suggest starting with something small to distract yourself' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider slightly more immediate emotional validation like 'Ugh, that panic is the worst feeling' before moving to 'it's just one test' reassurance"
