    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'super nerve-wracking' and 'I totally get why asking parents about parties feels like such a big deal' - makes the teen feel understood right away",
      "Excellent use of first-person conversational language throughout: 'Honestly, I think,' 'I'd probably approach it,' and 'I totally get' creates a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word script with placeholders ([friend's name], [day], [time]) that the teen can literally use, making the advice immediately actionable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one (like 😅 or 😊) could have enhanced the warm, casual tone in the opening sentence",
      "Could briefly acknowledge the possibility of parents saying no and validate that disappointment would be okay, to cover the emotional outcome of the advice"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive older sibling or friend texting advice without any corporate formatting or impersonal distance",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while not required, the response misses an opportunity to add visual warmth that matches the 'exciting but nerve-wracking' emotional content",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points or headers. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out. Uses natural transitions like 'The key is really...' and 'Sometimes they just want...' to integrate practical tips seamlessly."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅) after 'nerve-wracking' in the opening to visually reinforce the mixed emotions",
      "Could add one sentence validating that 'If they say no, it's okay to be disappointed - that doesn't mean you asked wrong' to balance the solution-focused advice with emotional safety"
