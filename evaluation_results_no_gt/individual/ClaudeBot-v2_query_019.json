    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation using visceral language like 'stomach drops' and 'gross and scary' that mirrors the physical anxiety of being falsely accused",
      "Natural first-person advisory voice throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I get why') that creates a supportive peer-like connection rather than an authority figure",
      "Specific, actionable script provided for confronting the teacher ('I get why this looks suspicious, but I didn't cheat...') including concrete evidence suggestions (timestamps, scratch work)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question combines two distinct queries (what the teacher said + assignment type) which slightly reduces the focus of the engagement, though it remains conversational",
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for the awkwardness of the situation, could potentially be read as minimizing the seriousness of an academic integrity accusation, though it pairs well with 'gross and scary'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, maintaining a flowing conversational text that reads like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The compound follow-up question slightly diverges from the ideal of a single, focused engaging question, though it remains contextually relevant",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph structure with no lists, headers, bold text, or bullet points. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider splitting the final compound question into two separate sentences to encourage more detailed sharing, or choose the most important one to prioritize",
      "For serious academic integrity situations, consider whether 😅 might undercut the gravity; 😕 or simply no emoji could alternatively convey appropriate concern while maintaining warmth"
