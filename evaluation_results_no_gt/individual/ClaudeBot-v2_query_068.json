    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'I'd be overthinking everything too' that creates instant rapport and empathy",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('If I were you', 'I'd try', 'I'm here') that makes it feel like a real person texting rather than generic advice",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts like 'Hey, I feel like I'm not doing great in this class...' that teens can actually use word-for-word"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly dense in the middle paragraph with multiple clauses; could break into two shorter paragraphs for better mobile readability",
      "While the absence of emojis is appropriate for this serious topic, a single supportive emoji at the start (like 😅 or 💙) could enhance warmth without undermining gravity"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow with zero bullet points or structured formatting - reads exactly like a supportive older sibling texting advice",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or bullet points. Uses natural paragraph breaks and flows conversationally from validation to perspective to advice."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the very beginning (like 💙 or 😅) to set an immediate supportive tone, though the text-only approach works well for this serious topic",
      "Break the third paragraph into two smaller paragraphs after '...respond.' to improve mobile readability and give the eye a rest before the counselor advice",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be even more open-ended by removing the multiple choice options ('is it the way they talk to you...') to invite more narrative sharing"
