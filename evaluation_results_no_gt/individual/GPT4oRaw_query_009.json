      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Oh no' and acknowledging the invasion of privacy",
      "Appropriate emoji usage (😬) that captures the awkwardness of the situation without being excessive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel less like a personal conversation and more like a generic response",
      "No practical advice offered - only asks if they want advice rather than providing even one concrete suggestion while requesting context",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person connection phrases like 'I get why that feels so invasive' or 'I'd be freaking out too' to make it feel like a real person responding",
      "Offer at least one concrete piece of advice while asking for context, such as 'If you want to break the ice, maybe try saying something like...'",
      "Combine the two final questions into one more natural question like 'What do you think they might have seen - and are you looking for advice on how to talk to them about it?'"
