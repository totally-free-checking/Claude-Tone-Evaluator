      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were in your shoes', 'I'd probably try', 'I totally get') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation starting with 'Ugh, that's honestly so annoying' and explicitly stating 'You're definitely not being too sensitive'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the serious nature of the topic",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

      "Consider adding one subtle supportive emoji (like 💙 or 😅) at the end of the first paragraph to enhance warmth while maintaining the serious tone",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be slightly more open-ended; instead of asking if they've tried calling them out (yes/no), ask 'What's stopping you from saying something?' to invite deeper reflection"
