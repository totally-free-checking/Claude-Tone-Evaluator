      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using 'Ugh' and acknowledging the 'uncomfortable spot' to normalize the awkwardness",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('You seem nice, but I'm not really looking to make new friends right now') rather than vague advice",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language in the advice section (no 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it') which makes it slightly less personal than ideal",
