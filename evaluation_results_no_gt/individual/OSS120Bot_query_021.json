      "Immediate emotional validation with physical empathy: 'I get how that can make your stomach flip and leave you feeling exposed' acknowledges the visceral reaction to privacy violations",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs like 'If you feel comfortable, you could drop a polite but firm comment...'",
      "Specific actionable script provided: 'Hey, could you please take this down? I wasn't okay with it being posted' gives exact words to use"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) following 'feeling exposed' may feel slightly mismatched with the vulnerability of the situation, though the single-emoji count is appropriate",

      "Consider adding more first-person language to the advice section (e.g., 'I'd probably start by...' or 'I think the best first step is...') to maintain the conversational 'friend' voice throughout",
      "While the single emoji is appropriately sparse, consider whether 😅 fits the seriousness of consent violations, or if 💙 or 😊 might better convey warmth without minimizing the violation"
