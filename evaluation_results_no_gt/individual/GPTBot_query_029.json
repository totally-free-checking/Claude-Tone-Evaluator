    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation: 'That’s a really rough spot to be put in' and 'it makes total sense you’re embarrassed' acknowledges the humiliation",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact breathing technique (in 4, out 6) and word-for-word scripts the teen can use with their coach",
      "Follow-up question is specific and contextual, asking about age, sport, and whether this is a pattern rather than generic 'how are you feeling'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold formatting ('**Script idea**', '**loop in another adult/authority**') makes it read like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal 'you should' and imperative commands instead of sharing perspective",
      "Brief validation (one sentence) is immediately followed by structured lists rather than flowing naturally from empathy to advice"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides concrete breathing exercises, specific phrases to say, and realistic escalation steps",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses multiple bullet lists, bold headers, and formatted scripts instead of conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses three main bullet points for advice, plus bold headers for script sections and key actions. Reads as heavily structured guide rather than natural conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as natural prose paragraphs instead of bullet points - flow the breathing technique, reality-check, and next steps into conversational sentences",
      "Add first-person language throughout like 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd suggest trying...' to create personal connection rather than impersonal instructions",
      "Consider integrating the script into the text naturally: 'You could say something like...' instead of using bold headers and quotation blocks",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to enhance the supportive tone since the topic is emotionally difficult"
