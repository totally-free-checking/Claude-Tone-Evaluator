    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get how frustrating','If I were you, I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact script for talking to teacher ('Hey, I'm having trouble collaborating...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly long third paragraph that combines multiple suggestions (teacher note, breathing exercises, snacks) which could be overwhelming",
      "Absence of emoji when one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😬) could have enhanced the opening validation"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and structured lists while maintaining readability",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two smaller chunks for better mobile readability - perhaps separate the teacher conversation advice from the self-care tips",
      "Adding one subtle emoji (like 😅) after 'Ugh, that really sucks' could enhance warmth without feeling excessive"
