    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'gut-punch feeling' and 'your feelings about it are 100% real'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for the teen to use: 'hey, I saw you guys got together—wish I'd known, would have loved to join!'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language like 'I think,' 'I get it,' or 'I'd say'—uses general statements instead of personal connection",
      "Could include more direct personal availability like 'I'm here if you need to talk'",
      "Slightly impersonal tone in analysis section ('Sometimes it's an oversight') that could be more connective"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—reads exactly like a supportive text message",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I get it,' 'I'm here') making it feel slightly more like general advice than a personal conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person connecting phrases like 'I get how much that stings' or 'I think the best thing to do here...' to make it feel more like a specific person talking",
      "Include a direct offer of continued support like 'I'm here if you need to talk more about this' at the end",
      "Consider combining the two follow-up questions into one flowing question or adding more personal context between them"
