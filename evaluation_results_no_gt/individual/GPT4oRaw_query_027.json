    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong immediate validation using first-person language ('Oh no, I feel you!') that acknowledges the frustration",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (Pomodoro technique, writing name on paper first, changing environment)",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question specific to the situation ('Want help outlining a plan for one of your assignments?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered lists and headers (### 1. **Break It Down**) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice sections (uses imperative commands like 'Break It Down' instead of 'I'd suggest breaking it down...')",
      "Transitions to solutions too quickly with 'Here's a game plan:' which feels corporate/structured rather than conversational"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end perfectly matches the ideal character - it's natural, specific, and invites continued conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting uses six numbered sections with bold headers, which is the opposite of the natural prose paragraphs required for this character",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response uses heavy formatting with 6 numbered sections and markdown headers (### 1. **Break It Down**). While the content within each section is prose, the structure is overwhelmingly list-based and over-formatted, reading like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive text message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the numbered list into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice together naturally - instead of '1. Break It Down' use 'I'd start by breaking it down...'",
      "Integrate first-person language throughout the advice sections ('I think the Pomodoro method works great' vs 'Pomodoro It') to maintain the conversational, supportive friend tone",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early on (like 😅 or 💪) to match the casual, empathetic opening tone, though this is less critical than fixing the prose structure"
