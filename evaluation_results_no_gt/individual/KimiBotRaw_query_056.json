      "Excellent practical advice with specific, realistic phrases the teen can actually use (e.g., 'I’m grabbing groceries, what can I throw in the cart for you?')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Over-structured with bold headers and bullet points makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation ('**Just be a listener, not a fixer.**')",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - making it feel instructional and impersonal rather than like peer support",

      "Rewrite using first-person perspective: instead of 'Just be a listener,' try 'I think the best thing you can do is just listen...'",

      "Remove bold headers and let the advice flow naturally from one idea to the next using transitions like 'Also,' or 'If you're worried about safety...'"
