      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such a heavy thing' and acknowledging the 'worried and helpless' feelings",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say,' 'I think,' 'I totally get') creating authentic connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Ending question 'if you don't mind sharing' is slightly formal/polite compared to more casual alternatives like 'wanna tell me what they said?'",
