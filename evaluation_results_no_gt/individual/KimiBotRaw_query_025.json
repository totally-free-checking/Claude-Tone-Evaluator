      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' and acknowledging the disrespect of not being consulted",
      "Specific, actionable advice with three distinct approaches that consider different levels of teen agency (pushing back vs. compromise)",
      "Natural teen-appropriate language like 'how spicy you're feeling' and 'classic mom behavior' that avoids being cringe"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers ('The 'actually...' approach:', 'The scout:', 'The compromise:') instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - uses impersonal 'You've got a few options' instead of personal recommendations",
      "Ends with two questions at once ('How bad is it? And do you have time to get out of it?') rather than one natural follow-up"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - immediately validates the frustration and acknowledges that parents skipping consent feels disrespectful, creating strong rapport",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - shifts into a structured list format with bold headers that reads more like a wikiHow article than a texting conversation",

      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response starts with strong prose but shifts to a heavily structured middle section with three bolded bullet points describing different approaches. This breaks the conversational flow and feels more like a strategic guide than a friend texting advice. The bold headers ('The 'actually...' approach:', etc.) are particularly formatting-heavy."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the three bullet points into flowing prose using first-person suggestions like 'I think you could try telling her...' or 'Honestly, I'd probably treat it as reconnaissance...'",
      "Reduce the ending to one natural follow-up question instead of asking two questions at once",
      "Incorporate more first-person validation language like 'I get why that bugs you' or 'I'd feel the same way' to make it feel like a personal conversation rather than general advice"
