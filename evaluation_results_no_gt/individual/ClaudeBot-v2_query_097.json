      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such an awkward spot to be in' and acknowledging 'you didn't do anything wrong'",

      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal constructions like 'The kindest thing is' instead of 'I'd say the kindest thing is'",
