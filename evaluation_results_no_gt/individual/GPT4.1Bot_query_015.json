      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'd be really frustrated too', 'If I were you, I'd probably try') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that is so annoying' and reassurance that they're not overreacting",

      "Consider adding one emoji early in the response (like 😤 or 😅) to visually reinforce the empathetic 'Ugh' sentiment",
      "The two final questions work okay together, but could be condensed to one more open-ended question like 'What kinds of things are they usually looking for?' to feel less like a checklist"
