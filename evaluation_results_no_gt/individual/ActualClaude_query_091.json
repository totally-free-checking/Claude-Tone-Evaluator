    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'That's such a frustrating feeling' and 'It really stings' that acknowledge the hurt",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Uses natural conversational language and contractions ('doesn't,' 'it's') that feel appropriate for texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') which makes it feel less like a personal conversation and more like general commentary",
      "Asks four questions total (two in paragraph 2, two in paragraph 3), which violates the 'avoid multiple questions at once' guideline and could overwhelm the user",
      "Very light on practical advice - mentions addressing it directly but provides no specific phrases, scripts, or concrete steps for how to do so"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language like 'I'd feel the same way' or 'I think your gut is probably right' to create a more personal connection",
      "Consolidate questions to just one natural follow-up at the end rather than asking four questions throughout",
      "Include one specific, actionable suggestion such as a concrete phrase they could say to the friend or a specific small step they could take to test the situation"
