    "strengths": [
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use word-for-word ('I care about you, and I'm not trying to attack you...')",
      "Ends with a strong, specific follow-up question that invites the teen to share more details ('If you tell me what the lie is about...')",
      "Distinguishes between small lies and big lies, showing nuanced understanding of different stakes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Zero emotional validation upfront - jumps immediately to advice without acknowledging how stressful, hurtful, or confusing this situation feels",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - reads like an impersonal instruction manual rather than a supportive friend",
      "Over-structured with headers (###), numbered lists, and bullet points throughout instead of natural conversational prose"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic scripts and specific phrases a teen could actually say",

      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses multiple markdown headers (###), numbered lists (1) 2) 3)), and bullet points throughout. Only the final sentence is true prose. Reads like a wikiHow article or therapy worksheet rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Start with 1-2 sentences of pure emotional validation before any advice (e.g., 'Ugh, that's such a gut-punchy feeling when you realize something doesn't add up. I'm sorry you're dealing with that suspicion.')",
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 conversational paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd probably say something like...' instead of imperative instructions",
      "Remove all headers, bold text, and bullet points - integrate the advice naturally into sentences as if explaining to a friend over text",
      "Add one warm emoji early (like 😅 or 💙) to set a supportive tone for this emotionally difficult topic"
