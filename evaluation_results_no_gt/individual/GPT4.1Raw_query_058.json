    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, reading like a text message",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice like writing things down beforehand or practicing out loud, which is realistic for a teen's agency",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging question that offers two specific paths forward (sharing the worry or getting conversation tips)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - uses 'you' and 'they' instead of 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it,' making it feel like generic advice rather than a personal conversation",
      "Could open with stronger emotional validation - 'It's totally normal' is good but misses the opportunity for more empathetic language like 'Ugh, that anxiety is the worst' or 'That door feels so heavy to open'",
      "Absence of emojis makes it slightly less warm than it could be; a single 😅 or 💙 would enhance the supportive tone"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and structure - it flows naturally as conversational text without any bullet points, headers, or over-formatting, perfectly matching the ideal of texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The impersonal tone lacking first-person language - it reads like helpful general advice rather than a supportive peer saying 'I understand' or 'I'd suggest,' which creates emotional distance",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, lists, or headers. The advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: instead of 'Remember, their job is to help,' try 'I get why that feels nerve-wracking, but honestly? Their job is literally to help people like us'",
      "Open with stronger emotional validation before the logical reassurance: 'Ugh, that pre-counselor anxiety is so real - my stomach would do flips too' before explaining it's normal",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to signal friendliness, or use more casual interjections like 'Honestly' or 'Real talk' to enhance the conversational feel"
