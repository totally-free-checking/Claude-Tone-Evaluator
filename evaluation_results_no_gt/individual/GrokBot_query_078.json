      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sounds so frustrating' and 'I get why that would make you feel kinda trapped' that makes the teen feel understood",
      "Uses natural first-person perspective throughout ('I get why', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I'd start by') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use like 'Hey, I'm pretty busy right now' and 'I appreciate it, but I'm good with my current friends'",

      "No emoji used when one (like 😅 or 😤) could have enhanced the warm, empathetic tone at the start",
