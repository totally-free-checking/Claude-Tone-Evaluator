    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('Oh, absolutely') that acknowledges the frustrating paradox of being told to calm down",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use in the moment ('I'll calm down when we address the problem')",
      "Ends with a natural, conversational question that invites further sharing ('Want to talk about what led up to it?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bold header ('**What sometimes helps in the moment:**') and bullet points which creates a self-help article format rather than natural conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making the response feel analytical and impersonal rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Phrasing like 'What's especially frustrating is that...' feels therapeutic/clinical rather than casual and relatable"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - ends with a natural, specific question that shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - uses structured formatting with headers and bullet lists instead of flowing conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "Response uses a bold markdown header followed by three asterisk bullet points to deliver advice, breaking the conversational flow. The advice should be integrated into natural prose paragraphs instead."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove the bold header and bullet points entirely. Integrate the advice into natural sentences like: 'If it were me, I'd probably try to take a quick breath first—not for them, but for myself. And honestly, you could even say something like...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection and warmth. Instead of 'That phrase can feel like adding fuel to the fire,' try 'Ugh, I totally get that—when someone tells me to calm down, it honestly just makes me more frustrated.'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to soften the analytical tone and signal emotional safety."
