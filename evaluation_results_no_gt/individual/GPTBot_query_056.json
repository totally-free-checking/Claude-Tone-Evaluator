      "Excellent specific advice with concrete scripts the teen can use (e.g., 'I’ve been thinking about you. Do you want to talk today—phone or in person?')",
      "Includes crucial safety information about suicide prevention with specific steps and crisis resources (988)",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' anywhere in the response, making it feel impersonal and detached",
      "Extremely over-structured with headers (##), numbered lists, and bullet points rather than natural prose paragraphs",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping into extensive practical advice - only one brief sentence of validation at the start"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific, actionable guidance with exact phrases to say and realistic steps for supporting a struggling friend, including appropriate crisis safety protocols",

      "notes": "Response uses multiple headers (##), a numbered list (1-5), nested bullet points, and bold text throughout. Only the first sentence is natural prose; everything else is structured formatting. Reads like a self-help resource rather than a text conversation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think the best thing you can do...' or 'I'd suggest starting by...' instead of headers and lists",
      "Move from impersonal statements like 'The most helpful thing is usually...' to personal ones like 'I get that you want to fix this, but honestly just being there...'",
      "Combine the bullet points into flowing prose that feels like texting - for example, instead of a numbered list, write 'You could try reaching out with something specific like...' and embed the advice naturally",
      "Add more emotional validation up front with warmth like 'That must feel so heavy' before offering any solutions"
