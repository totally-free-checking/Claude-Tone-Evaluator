    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I know', 'I’d say try') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that totally sucks!' and 'That moment... is the worst' that acknowledges the feeling without dismissing it",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads like a natural text conversation with advice flowing organically within sentences",
      "Specific, teen-realistic advice like 'bumming a snack' and checking if the cafeteria has 'extra fruit' that acknowledges actual teen resources and social dynamics"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one might have enhanced the warm, casual tone (though the text is warm enough without it)",
      "The phrase 'People usually figure out a way to get through it' is slightly generic compared to the otherwise specific, personal tone"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and consistent first-person language ('I'd say', 'I know') that makes it feel like texting with a supportive friend rather than receiving automated advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Complete absence of emoji when one well-placed emoji (like 😅 or 😊) could have reinforced the warm, casual tone at the opening",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. Advice is integrated conversationally ('If you've got a friend... I'd say try bumming a snack') rather than listed. No headers, bold text, or structural formatting—exactly the natural paragraph style ideal for this character."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the very beginning (like 😅 or 😊) to immediately signal the casual, friendly tone, though the text works well without it",
      "The advice section could be slightly more concise by combining the cafeteria and money suggestions, but the current length is still very readable"
