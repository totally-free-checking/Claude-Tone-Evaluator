    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as a conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use: 'Hey, I've noticed you've been doing a lot of the same things I do. Is everything okay? What's going on?'",
      "Opens with immediate validation ('Oh man, that does sound frustrating!') acknowledging the annoyance"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - uses impersonal 'You could' and 'It'll' instead, creating distance rather than connection",
      "Fails to end with a follow-up question to continue the conversation; the only question ('Have you talked to them about it yet?') appears early and feels rhetorical rather than inviting further sharing",
      "Could deepen emotional validation by acknowledging how weird or violating it feels to be copied before jumping to solutions"

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with natural paragraph breaks. Advice flows within sentences rather than being listed, reading like a text from a friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language like 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd feel the same way' to create a more personal, supportive connection rather than distant advice-giving",
      "Move the question to the end of the response and make it more open-ended to invite continued conversation, such as 'How are you feeling about confronting them?' or 'What do you think is driving them to copy you?'",
      "Consider starting with slightly more emphatic validation like 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' to match the teen's energy before acknowledging the friend's perspective"
