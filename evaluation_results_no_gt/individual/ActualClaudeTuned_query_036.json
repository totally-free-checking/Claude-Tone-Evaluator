    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd focus') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a real conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts like 'Hey, I noticed [specific thing] - how did that make you feel?' that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while conveying awkwardness, might slightly understate the seriousness of a trust concern (though it works for the 'tough spot' framing)",
      "Could include slightly more explicit emotional support upfront (e.g., 'That must feel so stressful') before moving to the 'friends have to figure it out' reality"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format with first-person language ('I think', 'I'd focus') makes it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling rather than reading advice",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using a heart or supportive emoji (💙) or no emoji instead of 😅 for serious trust concerns, though the current choice conveys the awkwardness of the situation well",
      "Could add one sentence of explicit emotional validation like 'I'm sorry you're carrying this worry' before the practical advice to strengthen the emotional support component"
