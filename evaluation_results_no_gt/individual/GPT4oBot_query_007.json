    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's *so* frustrating!') and uses first-person empathy ('I totally get why you're feeling annoyed') to create instant connection",
      "Uses natural teen-appropriate language and idioms ('coast,' 'dumped on,' 'throwing them under the bus') without sounding forced or cringe",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing for talking to the teacher ('Just a heads up, I ended up finishing most of the project...') and realistic steps given the tomorrow deadline"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions rather than one focused question, though both are natural and specific to the situation",
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) at the opening to enhance the emotional connection, though the absence is acceptable for the frustrated tone"

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Uses italics sparingly for natural emphasis (*so*, *you*) which enhances conversational tone without disrupting flow."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) at the very beginning to visually signal warmth alongside the 'Ugh'",
      "The two final questions could be combined into one slightly more open-ended question like 'How much of it do you think you can realistically finish tonight?' to keep the engagement focused while still inviting detail"
