      "Practical advice is realistic and specific, offering concrete options like 'rescheduling your other plan' and checking if 'a teammate can fill in'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Relies entirely on bullet points ('You could:' followed by three bullet items) rather than natural prose paragraphs",
      "Lacks first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest', making the advice feel impersonal rather than like a friend's perspective",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping to solutions - only one brief sentence before immediately moving to the bullet list",

      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose sentences, such as 'I'd probably start by figuring out which commitment is easier to reschedule...'",
      "Add more emotional validation upfront before offering solutions, like 'That sinking feeling when you check your calendar and realize you double-booked is the worst!'",
      "Include first-person language to create connection, such as 'I think the best approach depends on which thing is more flexible...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji like 😅 or 😬 early in the response to match the 'oops' nature of the situation"
