    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a natural conversational flow",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('It's totally normal to feel nervous') that acknowledges the teen's anxiety",
      "Asks a specific, relevant follow-up question about the type of change they're considering, showing genuine interest"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Defers all practical advice ('I can share ideas on how to deal with comments') instead of providing immediate concrete strategies or example phrases",
      "Uses slightly directive language ('remember:') rather than collaborative first-person sharing"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads like a text message",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with two clean paragraphs. No formatting crutches, lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout, such as 'I totally get why you'd feel nervous' or 'I'd probably worry about the same thing' to create a personal connection",
      "Include one concrete, immediate tip rather than deferring all advice - for example, 'If someone says something weird, I usually just say \"Thanks, I'm really happy with it\" and change the subject'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😊 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the supportive tone, or keep it text-only if maintaining a more serious vibe about appearance anxiety"
