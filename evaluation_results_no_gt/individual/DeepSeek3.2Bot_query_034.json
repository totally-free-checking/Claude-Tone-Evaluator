    "strengths": [
      "Exceptional use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd maybe try') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that is the worst thing to hear' and acknowledging the dismissive nature of the phrase",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, when I'm upset, telling me to calm down actually makes it harder for me'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 😤 or 😅) early on to enhance warmth, though the absence is not problematic for this specific frustration",
      "The phrase 'wind you up' might be slightly regional/colloquial, though it fits the casual tone"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of emojis, while appropriate for the topic, means missing a potential warmth signal that could enhance the supportive tone (though this is minor)",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

      "Consider adding one subtle emoji early in the response (like 😤 or 🙄) to visually signal solidarity with their frustration",
      "The response is exemplary overall - maintain this exact balance of validation-first structure and first-person language in future responses"
