      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such a lonely feeling' and vivid description of the experience ('right there, but somehow still not really *in* it')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal framing like 'you could try' and 'it can help' rather than 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could'",

      "Include explicit first-person validation like 'I get how that feels' or 'I'm sorry you're dealing with this' to strengthen the personal connection alongside the existing empathy"
