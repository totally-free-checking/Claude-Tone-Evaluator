    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of natural prose with zero bullet points or headers, creating a genuine conversational flow that reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use (e.g., 'I care about everyone here, but I'm not comfortable being stuck in the middle when there's fighting')",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I'm sorry', 'Let's talk', 'I'm here') that creates personal connection and warmth"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one might enhance the warm, supportive tone (though the text is warm enough without it)",
      "Contains multiple questions throughout the response rather than primarily at the end, which slightly disrupts the flow of advice before returning to engagement"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with specific, realistic advice scripts woven into conversational paragraphs rather than listed as bullet points",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Uses natural transitions like 'First off,' 'Also,' and 'At the end of the day' to flow between ideas."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😕 or 💙) at the beginning to set an immediate supportive tone without overdoing it",
      "Consolidate the questions so the primary engagement comes at the end; the middle question ('do you feel like you're directly involved...') could be reframed as a statement or saved for the follow-up to keep the advice section flowing smoothly"
