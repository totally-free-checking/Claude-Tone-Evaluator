      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can use like 'just chatting with Emma about homework' and 'I'd like some privacy with my friends'",

      "Uses a bulleted list ('A few approaches that might help:') with three bullet points instead of flowing prose paragraphs",

      "The validation is good but could be warmer before pivoting to 'they're usually just curious' - sit with the annoyance a bit longer before explaining parent motivations"
