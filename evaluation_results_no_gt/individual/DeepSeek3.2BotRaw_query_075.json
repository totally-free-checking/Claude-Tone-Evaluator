    "strengths": [
      "Uses natural prose paragraphs with zero bullet points or formatting, reading like a text message",
      "Immediately validates feelings with 'that's totally normal' and 'everyone's been there' to normalize the anxiety",
      "Ends with a conversational question 'Want a few ideas to make it easier?' that invites continued dialogue",
      "Uses casual language and contractions ('that's', 'it's', 'honestly') appropriate for teen communication"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making the response feel impersonal despite casual tone",
      "Provides no concrete advice or actionable suggestions - only offers to give ideas later without providing any substance",
      "Too brief at only three short sentences; may feel dismissive or like a conversation starter rather than actual support",
      "Missing emoji opportunity (like 😅 or 😊) that could enhance warmth for this anxiety-inducing social situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with no bullet points or over-structuring, maintaining conversational flow",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - fails to provide any concrete suggestions or actionable help, only teasing future advice",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no structural elements, though brevity makes it feel more like a conversation opener than a complete response"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to create personal connection (e.g., 'I think that's totally normal' or 'I'd feel the same way')",
      "Provide at least one concrete suggestion before asking if they want more ideas, such as 'Maybe try texting the host to see who else is coming?'",
      "Expand to 2-3 paragraphs with substantive content to avoid feeling dismissive or like an automated greeting",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji like 😅 or 😊 early in the response to match the casual, supportive tone"
