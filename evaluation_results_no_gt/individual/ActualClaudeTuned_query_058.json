    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'I'm so sorry you're feeling nervous about this! That's totally understandable' - validates feelings before offering any advice",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('Honestly, I think', 'I think once you get there', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific actionable script provided: 'You could even start by just saying \"I'm not really sure where to begin\"' - gives exact words to use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😊 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the supportive tone, though the absence is acceptable for this serious topic",
      "Practical advice focuses heavily on the conversation itself but misses logistical details like how to actually schedule the appointment or what to expect in the first meeting"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured self-help guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly limited practical logistics - while it mentions what to say, it could briefly mention how to initiate contact with the counselor",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😊) after the opening validation to set a friendly tone, though this is optional for serious topics",
      "Include one sentence about logistics (e.g., 'You can usually just drop by their office or send a quick email to set up a time') to complement the conversation advice",
      "The follow-up question is excellent - keep using this specific, binary-choice format ('is it more about X or Y') as it makes it easier for nervous teens to respond"
