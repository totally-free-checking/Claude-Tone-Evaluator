    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's SO frustrating!' and 'drive anyone up the wall' that acknowledges the anger and invasion of privacy",
      "Good practical advice that's realistic for a teen's situation (lock box, talking to sibling, involving parents) and considers their limited agency",
      "Ends with specific, engaging questions about what the sibling is looking for, showing genuine interest in understanding the specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a 4-item bullet list ('A few ideas that might help:') which breaks the conversational flow and reads more like a self-help article than a text from a friend",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - making it feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend sharing their perspective",
      "Phrases like 'Sometimes people don't realize' and 'Consider whether' are overly general and impersonal instead of using natural first-person reactions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The opening validation perfectly captures the ideal tone with 'Ugh, that's SO frustrating!' immediately acknowledging the emotional weight and making the teen feel heard",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The bullet point section completely breaks character by shifting from conversational prose to a structured list format with 'A few ideas that might help:' followed by four bullet points",

      "prose_percentage": "64%",
      "notes": "Response shifts abruptly from prose to a structured bullet list with header 'A few ideas that might help:' containing four items. This over-formatting destroys the conversational texting flow that should characterize a teen support bot."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points to natural prose by flowing the advice into sentences like 'I'd probably start by trying to talk to them directly, and if that doesn't work, maybe grab a small lock box for your important stuff. If you're both at home, looping in a parent could help too.','Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I think the best first step is...' or 'I'd be so annoyed too' to create that supportive friend/sibling dynamic instead of sounding like an advice column",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😤 or 😅) after the opening validation to enhance the casual, texting vibe"
