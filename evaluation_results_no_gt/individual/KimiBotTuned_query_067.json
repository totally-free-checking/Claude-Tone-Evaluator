      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using 'Ugh' and 'weird pressure-y feeling' that perfectly captures the teen's anxiety",

      "Could use more explicit first-person language from the bot's perspective (like 'I think' or 'I'd say') to strengthen the personal connection",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The seamless blend of validation and practical scripting - it validates the pressure first, then immediately gives concrete phrases to use without breaking the conversational flow",
