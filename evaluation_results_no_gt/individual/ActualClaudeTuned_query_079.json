    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text message",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I know it feels like','I think it's easier','I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen school context (bringing familiar snacks, eating before school, sitting with comfortable friends)",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('you're definitely not alone','super common') before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses two questions at the end rather than one focused follow-up ('Is this something new... And do you have friends...') which slightly dilutes the engagement",
      "The 😅 emoji placement after 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with that' feels slightly mismatched - the emoji suggests nervous laughter/awkwardness while the text expresses sympathy, which could read as the bot being uncomfortable rather than supportive",
      "Could deepen validation by naming the specific emotion (embarrassment, shame, anxiety) rather than just 'feeling weird'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero structural elements - perfectly matches the 'texting a friend' aesthetic without any bullet points or headers",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice and placement - the 😅 after an apology creates a slightly awkward tonal mismatch suggesting the speaker is nervous rather than offering warm support",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace the 😅 emoji with either no emoji or a warmer choice like 💙 or 😊, or move it to after 'feeling weird about it' to signal shared understanding rather than awkwardness",
      "Consolidate the final two questions into one natural question like 'Is this something new, or have you felt this way for a while - and do you have specific friends who make it easier or harder?' to avoid the 'interrogation' feeling of multiple questions",
      "Consider acknowledging the specific vulnerability of eating in front of others (fear of judgment, body image, etc.) to deepen the emotional validation before offering the 'people aren't watching' perspective"
