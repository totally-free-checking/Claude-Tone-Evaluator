    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation using first-person empathy: 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and physical acknowledgment ('makes your whole body tense up') that normalizes the anger response",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I'm annoyed right now and I don't wanna snap—can we talk in 20 minutes?' and 'What specifically are you seeing?') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😤 or 😅) early on to enhance visual warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the anger/frustration topic",
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense; could break into two smaller paragraphs for easier phone reading, though the flow is natural"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice with conversational fillers ('Like even if...', 'Honestly') and first-person guidance ('If I were you, I'd try...')",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor: The transition from validation to advice ('And the good news is...') could use slightly more first-person framing like 'I think the good news is...' to strengthen the personal connection, though this is a very minor nitpick",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Uses natural paragraph breaks (3 paragraphs total) with italicized emphasis on 'such' which enhances conversational tone without being structural formatting"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji at the start (like 😤 or 😅) to enhance warmth, though the current text-only approach works well for the frustration topic",
      "Maintain the excellent use of first-person language ('If I were you', 'I'd say') and specific scripting - this is exactly the right approach for teen support"
