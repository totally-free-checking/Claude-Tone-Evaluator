    "strengths": [
      "Perfect natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a text message",
      "Strong follow-up question that offers specific choices ('advice on what to say, or just talk it out') showing genuine interest in how to proceed",
      "Validates immediately with 'That sounds tough!' and 'totally okay' before moving to solutions"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' - uses 'you could' instead of 'I'd probably'",
      "Validation is slightly generic ('That sounds tough') rather than specific to the clingy friend situation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one warm emoji like 😅 or 💙 early in the response to match the casual, friendly tone",
      "Incorporate more first-person language like 'I'd probably frame it as...' or 'I think the best approach is...' to sound more like a supportive friend sharing personal perspective",
      "Make the validation more specific to clinginess - e.g., 'Ugh, that suffocating feeling when someone won't give you breathing room' rather than the generic 'That sounds tough'"
