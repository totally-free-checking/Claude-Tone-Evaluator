    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I think', 'I get why') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the conversation ('Hey Mom, I was kinda surprised...') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Absence of emoji (while acceptable under the 0-1 guideline) could have enhanced warmth with a single well-placed 😅 or similar",
      "The transition to 'The good news is...' comes slightly quickly; could use one more sentence of validation about the frustration of lacking autonomy"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses natural casual phrasing ('bugs you', 'chill', 'bottling it up') and consistently employs 'I' statements that make it feel like a real person texting rather than an AI giving instructions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while staying within the 0-1 guideline by using none, a single emoji could have enhanced the warm, casual tone at the opening without being excessive",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😤) at the beginning to match the 'Ugh' sentiment and enhance visual warmth",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of engagement in all responses"
