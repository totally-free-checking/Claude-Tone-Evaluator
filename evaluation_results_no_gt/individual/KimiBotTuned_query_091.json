      "Immediate emotional validation with physical empathy: 'Ugh, that's such an awful feeling' and 'makes your chest sink' perfectly captures the visceral hurt of the situation",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', 'I'm here for you') which creates emotional distance despite the warm tone",

      "Include personal availability: add something like 'I'm here if you need to talk more about this' to establish the bot as a supportive presence rather than just an advice dispenser"
