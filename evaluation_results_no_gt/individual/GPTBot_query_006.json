      "Provides specific, actionable techniques like the 4-6 breathing exercise and 5-4-3-2-1 grounding method that a teen can use immediately",
      "Asks relevant, specific questions about the test type and timeline to help assess the situation",
      "Opening line 'That sinking feeling is awful' effectively names and validates the emotional experience"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with headers ('Right now (2 minutes):', 'Then, quick perspective:') and multiple numbered lists that read like a CBT worksheet rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses only second-person instructional language which feels impersonal",
      "Jumps immediately from one sentence of validation into extensive problem-solving without lingering on the emotional support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the breathing techniques and grounding exercises are concrete, realistic for teens, and immediately actionable",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the response uses headers, numbered lists, and bullet points throughout, reading like a self-help article rather than a text conversation with a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 9,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses three distinct formatted sections with headers (bold text), two numbered lists (1-3), and one bulleted list with dashes. Only the first sentence and final paragraph are natural prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the structured lists into flowing conversational paragraphs - instead of '1. Exhale longer... 2. Name 5-4-3-2-1...' write something like 'I'd suggest trying a quick breathing trick first - inhale for 4 seconds, then exhale for 6 to 8. It sounds simple but it really tells your body you're safe. You could also try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding thing where you name things you see and feel...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - use phrases like 'I get that sinking feeling too', 'I'd probably be spiraling too', or 'I think the best thing right now is...' instead of instructional 'you' statements",
      "Spend more time on emotional validation before problem-solving - expand on 'That sinking feeling is awful' with something like 'It's the worst when you walk out of a test and your stomach just drops. We've all had that moment where we're replaying every question we might have messed up.'",
      "Replace the list of three questions at the end with one natural follow-up question like 'Do you want to talk through what specifically felt rough about it, or would it help more to just vent for a minute?'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to soften the clinical tone of the advice that follows"
