    "strengths": [
      "Exceptional first-person language throughout ('If I were in your shoes,' 'I’d probably be annoyed too,' 'I think it helps') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation starting with 'Ugh, that is the absolute worst feeling' and normalizing with 'almost everyone has had one of those moments'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural flow between validation, advice, and engagement without any structural formatting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could offer one specific script or phrase to try with parents rather than just suggesting to 'ask what would make them feel comfortable'",
      "While zero emojis is appropriate for the frustrated tone, a single supportive emoji (like 💙) could enhance warmth without undermining the seriousness"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational tone with consistent first-person perspective that makes it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling rather than receiving advice from a system",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The advice section, while good, could provide slightly more specific language templates for approaching the conversation with parents",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullets, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one brief example script like 'Hey, I know you're worried—would it help if I texted you every hour?' to make the communication advice more concrete",
      "The response could include one warm emoji (perhaps 😅 or 💙) after the opening validation to visually signal warmth, though the text alone is sufficiently warm"
