    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using first-person empathy: 'Ugh, I'm so sorry — that guilty, heavy feeling... is the worst'",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for quitting ('I really appreciate being part of this, but I'm going to step away...') rather than vague advice",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'Honestly, quitting doesn't...') creating authentic connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) to enhance visual warmth, though the absence is acceptable for the serious tone",
      "The follow-up question asks two things at once (what activity + which type of guilt), which slightly splits the conversational focus"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - the response flows as conversational paragraphs that read like a supportive friend texting, with advice embedded naturally within sentences rather than listed out",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while the absence is appropriate for the serious topic, adding one subtle supportive emoji could have enhanced the warmth without undermining the gravity of the guilt feelings",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The advice flows naturally within paragraphs using phrases like 'If I were you, I'd try...' rather than structured lists"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😊) at the end of the first paragraph to enhance warmth without trivializing the serious emotions",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more focused by asking about the activity first, then following up on the guilt type in a subsequent exchange to keep the conversation flowing naturally"
