    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I think most people have been in that scramble', 'I know it feels huge')",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation that acknowledges the specific frustration ('absolute worst feeling', 'totally let down', 'rite of passage, but a really annoying one')",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact script for messaging partner ('Hey, the project is due tomorrow and I need your part by tonight at the latest...')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks a warm closing phrase like 'I'm here if you need to talk' that would reinforce ongoing support",
      "The phrase 'done your part in communicating' is slightly formal/clinical compared to the rest of the casual tone"

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs using 'First... Second...' transitions that read conversationally rather than as a list."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief warm closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or 'You've got this' to end on emotional support after the practical question",
      "Replace 'done your part in communicating' with something more casual like 'so you've covered your bases' or 'so you know you tried' to maintain the conversational flow"
