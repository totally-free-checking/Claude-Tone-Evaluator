    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as a conversation",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying' and acknowledging the invasive feeling",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use like 'Just [friend's name] about homework' and the compromise language"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language from the bot's perspective - doesn't use 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' which makes it feel slightly impersonal despite being conversational",
      "Could validate a bit more before explaining the parent perspective (the 'parents do this out of curiosity' line, while helpful, slightly shifts away from pure validation)",
      "The transition to advice is a bit abrupt without a connecting phrase like 'Here's what I'd try'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and natural paragraph structure - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of first-person 'I' statements from the bot (such as 'I think you should...' or 'I'd say...') makes it feel less like a personal connection and more like general advice, even though the tone is warm",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective using phrases like 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd probably say something like...' to make it feel more like a specific person talking rather than general guidance",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing to reinforce the supportive relationship",
      "The explanation of why parents do this is good context but could be framed more personally like 'I know it feels intense, and honestly I think parents often do this because...'"
