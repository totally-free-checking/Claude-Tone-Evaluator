    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and physical empathy ('make your stomach twist') that normalizes the conflict between loyalty and self-respect",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd keep it simple,' 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts ('No, I'm not doing that,' 'I'm not comfortable with that—don't ask me again') and concrete exit strategies (text someone, blame curfew) that are realistic for teens"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question lists specific categories ('sexual, substances') which, while helpful, slightly breaks the conversational flow with its list-like structure within the question",
      "Third paragraph is slightly long with multiple em-dash clauses, though still readable as natural prose"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The seamless integration of first-person advice ('If I were you, I'd...') within natural prose paragraphs, perfectly capturing the 'supportive older sibling' voice without any bullet points or over-formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question's use of a categorized list ('sexual, substances, or something else') introduces a hint of structural formatting that slightly diverges from pure conversational flow",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs using conversational transitions. The third paragraph contains a list within a sentence using commas and 'or,' which maintains prose structure rather than breaking into formatted bullets"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙) at the end of the first paragraph for visual warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the serious topic",
      "The follow-up question could flow more naturally as 'What kind of thing are they pressuring you about?' rather than listing categories, though the current version shows attentiveness to safety concerns"
