      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I promise', 'If I were you, I'd') that creates genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is technically two questions which slightly dilutes the focus, though they flow naturally together",
