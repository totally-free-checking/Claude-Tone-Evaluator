    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I swear,' 'I think,' 'I'd try,' 'If I were you, I might') creating genuine connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('That's such a weirdly exciting and terrifying feeling all at once') that normalizes the overthinking",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Specific, contextual follow-up question about hallway vs. eye contact that shows real interest in their specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice could be slightly more specific - while 'smile back' is good, adding one concrete conversation starter example would strengthen it",
      "The phrase 'best sign ever' might slightly overstate a simple smile, though it works for validation purposes"

      "The balance between validation and advice is strong, but you could extend the validation one more sentence before transitioning to the 'best sign' perspective"
