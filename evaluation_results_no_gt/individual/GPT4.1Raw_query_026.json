    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting, creating a smooth conversational flow",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's rough!' and acknowledging the preemptive awkwardness ('even before they start')",
      "Natural casual language like 'super awkward' and 'dreaded' matches teen speech patterns without trying too hard",
      "Engaging specific follow-up question that distinguishes between knowing the topic vs. the general 'we need to talk' anxiety"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language (no 'I think', 'I get it', 'I'd be annoyed too'), making the response feel observational rather than personally connected",
      "No practical advice or actionable suggestions offered - purely validation and questioning without any guidance on how to handle the conversation",
      "Very brief at only two sentences - while not dismissive, it could offer slightly more substance or preliminary perspective"
    ],

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, bold text, or lists. Reads like a text message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language like 'I totally get why you'd be dreading this' or 'I'd be annoyed too' to create personal connection rather than observational distance",
      "Include one small piece of preliminary advice (e.g., 'Maybe try to think of one thing you actually want to say to him') while asking for more details",
      "Consider expanding slightly to 2-3 sentences of validation before the question to provide more substantial support"
