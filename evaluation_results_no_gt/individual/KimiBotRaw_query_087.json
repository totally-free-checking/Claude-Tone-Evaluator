    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation: 'Ugh, that's such a tough spot to be in! Needing space doesn't make you a bad friend at all—it's actually super normal and healthy'",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts that teens can literally copy-paste: 'Hey, I love hanging out with you, but I need some alone time to recharge. It's not about you—I just get socially drained easily'",
      "Uses casual, age-appropriate language and contractions throughout: 'super clingy', 'blowing up your phone', 'heads-down on work/studying/chilling solo'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers instead of flowing prose - contains two distinct bullet lists with bold headers ('Some low-drama ways to create breathing room:', 'Boundaries to set:') which breaks conversational flow",
      "Lacks first-person perspective and personal connection - uses general observations ('Sometimes people just have different appetites', 'Here's the thing') rather than 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it'",
      "Asks multiple questions in succession which can feel slightly overwhelming rather than one natural follow-up"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides realistic, specific scripts and actionable steps that acknowledge teen limitations (texting dynamics, social anxiety) rather than vague platitudes",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting structure - uses 6 bullet points across two formatted sections with headers, making it read like a wiki article or self-help list rather than a supportive text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response relies heavily on structured formatting with two bold headers and two bullet lists containing 3 items each. The core advice is delivered through bullet points rather than woven into natural paragraphs, significantly diverging from the prose-only ideal."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert all bullet points into flowing conversational paragraphs - weave the three strategies (gradual fade, honest chat, redirect) into a natural narrative like 'You could try pulling back gradually by... or if you want to be direct, maybe say something like...'",
      "Add first-person language to create connection: replace 'Here's the thing' with 'I think the issue is...' or 'I'd probably start by...' and include phrases like 'I totally get why that feels suffocating'",
      "Remove the mid-text question 'Have they always been like this...' and keep only the final question to avoid overwhelming the user, or integrate it more naturally into the prose"
