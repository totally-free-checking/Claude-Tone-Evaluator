    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, realistic scripts the teen can use when talking to their teacher (e.g., 'What do I need to do to earn my seat back?')",
      "Strong follow-up question that invites continuation and offers personalized help ('If you tell me what grade you're in... I can help you craft the exact thing to say')",
      "Uses first-person validation effectively in the opening ('Yeah, I'd be mad too')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Insufficient emotional validation - only one sentence of support before jumping into 5 bullet points of strategic advice",
      "Lacks natural prose flow; the structured format creates distance rather than the intimacy of a supportive text exchange"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality and specific scripting for talking to the teacher shows deep understanding of teen agency and social dynamics",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is extremely bullet-heavy with bold headers, which is the opposite of the natural prose paragraphs specified in the ideal character",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response contains 5 distinct bullet points with bold headers (e.g., 'Figure out the 'why' first', 'Talk to your teacher privately'). Only 2 sentences at the beginning are in natural prose. The rest is heavily structured with formatting that resembles a self-help guide rather than a conversational text."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation - instead of 'Figure out the why first,' try 'First, I'd try to figure out why they moved you...'",
      "Add more emotional validation throughout, not just at the beginning - acknowledge how isolating it feels to be separated from friends before offering the strategic advice",
      "Keep the excellent specific scripts you provided, but embed them in sentences like 'If it were me, I'd probably say something like...' rather than listing them as bullet points"
