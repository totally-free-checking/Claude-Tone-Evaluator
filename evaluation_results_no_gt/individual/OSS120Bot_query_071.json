    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with relatable physical description of anxiety ('it's like your stomach does a little flip every time you think about the grade')",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry','If I were you, I'd','most of us have been there') creating genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother; 'If I were you' comes somewhat abruptly after the reassurance",

      "Consider adding a brief bridge phrase between validation and advice like 'Here's what might help' or 'I've got a few ideas' to smooth the transition",
      "The response is exemplary overall; maintain this level of first-person language and specific, realistic advice for teen contexts"
