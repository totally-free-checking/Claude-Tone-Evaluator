    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with visceral language ('punch in the gut,' 'it just stings') that captures the exact feeling of being left out",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can use ('Hey, I saw you guys did [activity] — it looked fun! I'd love to join next time...') rather than vague advice to 'just talk to them'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('Honestly, I get it,' 'I think it could help,' 'I'd love to join') creating a personal, supportive connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The shift to 'million innocent reasons' comes slightly quickly after validation; could use one more sentence of pure empathy before offering alternative perspectives",
      "While no emoji is appropriate for this serious topic, a single supportive emoji (like 💙) could optionally enhance warmth without undermining the gravity of the feelings"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from emotional validation to rationalization ('There could be a million innocent reasons') happens slightly abruptly and could benefit from a softer bridge acknowledging that the feelings are valid regardless of the reasons",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure validation before offering the 'innocent reasons' perspective to ensure the teen feels fully heard before problem-solving",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of contextual engagement in future responses by tying questions to specific details mentioned in the user's query"
