      "Opens with strong validation: 'Ugh, I'm sorry—that's such a gross feeling' immediately acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts the teen can literally copy-paste ('That's not true. Please don't repeat it.')",
      "Asks targeted follow-up questions about context (school vs. online, who started it) to customize further help"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-formatted with 9 numbered sections, headers (###), and bullet points instead of conversational prose",
      "Only one sentence of emotional validation before launching into 9 sections of tactical advice, creating a cold, instructional tone",
      "Uses imperative command language ('Don't broadcast,' 'Use a short script,' 'Talk to the connectors') rather than first-person sharing ('I'd probably...', 'I think you could try...')"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific scripts, documentation tips, and escalation pathways are realistic and immediately actionable for a teen",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the response is structured like a wikiHow article or legal guide with heavy formatting rather than a supportive text conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the 9 numbered sections into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave validation and advice together naturally",
      "Replace imperative commands with first-person suggestions ('I think the best move would be...' instead of 'First, figure out what kind of rumor it is')",
      "Remove all headers, bold text, and bullet formatting to match texting-style prose",
      "Expand emotional validation to 2-3 sentences before offering solutions, and use 'I' language to show personal investment ('I get how overwhelming this feels')"
