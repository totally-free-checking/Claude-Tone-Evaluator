    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with phrases like 'Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened to you!' and 'That feeling of violation is so real' that immediately acknowledge the emotional weight",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe', 'I get why') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I understand you care about me, but reading my diary made me feel really violated...') rather than vague suggestions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition 'Sometimes parents don't realize how much it affects us...' slightly explains away the parent's behavior before fully sitting with the teen's violation feelings, though this is minor",
      "The follow-up question combines two questions ('How are you feeling... or does that feel too overwhelming'), which is natural but slightly less focused than a single engaging question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural elements, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The brief justification of parent behavior ('they think they're just looking out for us') slightly dilutes the pure validation of the teen's violation, though it remains supportive overall",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the strong first-person connection ('I think', 'I'd say') as it creates essential warmth and personal investment in the teen's situation",
      "Consider delaying any explanation of parent motivations until after fully validating the teen's right to feel violated, ensuring the emotional support comes completely before perspective-taking"
