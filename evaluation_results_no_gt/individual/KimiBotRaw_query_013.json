    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and normalization ('Oh man, that adrenaline rush is the worst!', 'literally everyone gets the shaky hands thing')",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (tense/release technique, digging heels into floor, holding clicker with both hands)",
      "Uses casual, age-appropriate language without being cringe ('super tight', 'trips the calm down switch', 'fight a bear')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers ('**Right now:**', '**During the presentation:**') instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - reads as instructional rather than conversational",
      "Missing follow-up question at the end - closes with encouragement but doesn't invite continued dialogue"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific techniques (clenching fists for 5 seconds, belly breathing, using bigger gestures) are concrete and immediately actionable for a teen about to present",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting structure - uses 6+ bullet points with bold headers instead of flowing conversational paragraphs, reading more like a self-help article than a text from a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses bold headers (**Right now:**, **During the presentation:**, **Mindset shift:**) with nested bullet points, creating a structured checklist format rather than natural prose. Only the opening and closing sentences are true paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation (e.g., 'I'd try clenching your fists tight for 5 seconds then releasing - I do this three times and it really helps')",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout ('I used to shake so bad during presentations', 'I'd say the best trick is...', 'I get how awful that adrenaline feels') to create connection",
      "End with a specific follow-up question like 'What are you presenting on?' or 'Is it a big class or small group?' to keep the conversation going",
      "Move the mindset shift earlier to validate feelings before listing techniques, rather than burying it after the bullet points"
