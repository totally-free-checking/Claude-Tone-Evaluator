    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, visceral validation using 'Ugh, that's such a stressful, heavy feeling' which perfectly captures the emotional weight",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you, I'd start') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to teacher: 'I'm really worried about my grade; is there anything specific I should focus on, or any extra credit I could do?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive text message"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while conveying nervousness, might slightly underplay the seriousness of 'scared' compared to more supportive options like 😟 or 💙",
      "Could add one more sentence of emotional validation before transitioning to the 'If I were you' advice paragraph to strengthen the support-to-solutions ratio"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting—maintains conversational flow throughout while embedding advice naturally within sentences",

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😟 or 💙 instead of 😅 to better match the 'scared' emotion, or omit the emoji entirely since the warm prose carries the tone",
      "Add one more validating sentence after 'The fact you're even worried about it means you care' before jumping to 'If I were you' to ensure the teen feels fully heard before receiving solutions"
