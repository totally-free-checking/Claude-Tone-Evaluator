    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'We've all had', 'I'm here if you need to talk' vibe) creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact script wording ('Hey, totally spaced on practice, can we do this another time?') that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly more gradual - 'The good news is' slightly rushes past the emotional validation",
      "Could add one more validating phrase specifically acknowledging the stress of letting people down before jumping to solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout while delivering substantial advice",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

      "Consider adding one more empathetic phrase about the anxiety of disappointing people before transitioning to 'The good news is'",
      "The first-person perspective ('I'd say', 'We all have') is excellent - maintain this approach as it creates strong rapport",
      "The follow-up question is perfect - specific to their situation and conversational rather than clinical"
