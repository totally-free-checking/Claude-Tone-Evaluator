    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so rough!' and 'I totally get why it sucks' establishes warmth right away",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script for the teen to use: 'I know you don't mean it this way, but when you compare me to [sibling], it makes me feel pretty bad. I'm trying to do my own thing'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'm sorry', 'I totally get') creating authentic connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched to the emotional context - it implies nervous laughter/awkwardness rather than empathy for a painful situation",
      "Could briefly acknowledge what to do if the conversation doesn't work (e.g., 'If they don't listen, remember their comparison says more about them than you')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection - 😅 conveys nervous energy rather than the warmth/empathy appropriate for someone feeling hurt by comparisons",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice is woven into conversational sentences rather than presented as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace the 😅 with 💙, 😔, or simply omit it, as the nervous laughter emoji slightly undermines the validation of how much the situation hurts",
      "Consider adding one sentence about boundary-setting or self-validation if the family member doesn't respond well to the conversation, to ensure the teen feels empowered even if the advice doesn't work"
