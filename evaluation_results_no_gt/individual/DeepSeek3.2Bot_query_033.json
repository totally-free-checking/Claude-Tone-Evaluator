    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'I totally get why you're mad!' followed by acknowledgment that it feels unfair and can throw off the whole day",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think,' 'I totally get,' 'Most of us have been through it') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for talking to the teacher: 'Hey, I was wondering why the seating got switched up?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched with the emotion of anger (typically conveys nervousness/awkwardness rather than solidarity with frustration)",
      "Could extend validation slightly longer before moving to the 'teachers do this a lot' reframing perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with advice flowing organically within conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice (😅) doesn't perfectly match the emotional context of anger, though it successfully conveys warmth",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice is integrated into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😕 or 😤 instead of 😅 when validating anger, or omit the emoji entirely since the warm tone is already established through words",
      "The validation is strong but could add one more sentence acknowledging the specific pain of being separated from friends before moving to the 'it's not personal' perspective"
