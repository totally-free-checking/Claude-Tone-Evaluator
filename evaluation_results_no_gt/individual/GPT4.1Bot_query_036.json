      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd probably...', 'I totally get that weird, stomach-twisty feeling', 'I'm here') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with specific physical descriptors ('stomach-twisty feeling') that teens can relate to",
      "Provides concrete, realistic script for what to say ('Hey, I just want you to be happy...') rather than vague 'just talk to them' advice",

      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 😅) early on to enhance warmth, though the absence is not problematic for this topic",

      "Continue using the strong first-person language ('If I were you', 'I'd say') as this creates the feeling of a real person sharing wisdom rather than an AI dispensing advice"
