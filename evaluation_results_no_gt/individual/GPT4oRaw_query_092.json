    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use ('Hey, I've noticed some changes...') that balances concern without being accusatory",
      "Strong emotional validation opening with 'Ah, that's tough' and acknowledging how hard it is to watch a friend change"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it', 'I'm here for you') making it feel more like general advice than a personal conversation",
      "Follow-up question is slightly awkwardly phrased ('Would talking to them feel comfortable for you?') rather than something more natural like 'How do you feel about bringing it up?'",
      "Missing emoji or explicit 'I'm here if you need to talk' closing that would reinforce personal support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language and personal connection - uses 'you could try' and 'it sounds like' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think', making it feel impersonal despite the casual tone",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as continuous conversational paragraphs with no lists, bold text, or structural elements. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language like 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd suggest...' or 'I get how worrying that is' to make it feel like a supportive friend rather than an advice manual",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😕) or explicitly stating 'I'm here if you need to talk' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "Simplify the closing question to something more natural like 'How do you feel about bringing it up with them?' instead of 'Would talking to them feel comfortable for you?'"
