    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person validation opening with 'Ugh, I get that feeling' that immediately creates connection and empathy",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs like 'If you can, try breaking those five assignments...'",
      "Highly specific and teen-realistic advice including 'a quick scroll on your phone' as a reward, showing understanding of teen lifestyle"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The metaphor 'brain-freeze moment' could be slightly confusing since brain freeze typically refers to physical ice cream headaches, though the meaning is clear in context",
      "Could potentially offer one additional validation phrase after the advice section to reinforce support before the question, though the balance is still strong"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, maintaining a conversational text-like flow throughout",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one brief validating phrase after giving advice (like 'You've got this' or 'Take it one step at a time') to bookend the support before the question",
      "The response is exemplary in using first-person language ('I get that feeling', 'we've all been there') - maintain this approach consistently"
