    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd maybe jot down...', 'I promise they won't think it's weird') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with specific physical descriptions of anxiety ('heart race and your hands sweaty', 'freeze up') that normalizes the experience",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to say ('I'm kind of nervous talking about this') and practical prep tips (jotting down keywords)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Absence of emojis, while acceptable, could potentially enhance warmth with a single supportive emoji like 😊 or 💙 given the nervous topic",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😊 or 💙) at the end of the first paragraph to enhance emotional connection, though the text-only approach is still effective",
      "Continue using the first-person advisory style ('If I were you...') as it creates strong rapport and feels less prescriptive than impersonal advice"
