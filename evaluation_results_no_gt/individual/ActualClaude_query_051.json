    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oof, that really stings, doesn't it?' which acknowledges the pain right away",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with natural transitions between thoughts",
      "Strong follow-up question that is specific to their situation ('Have you noticed specific things that make you feel this way?') rather than generic",
      "Appropriate casual language that matches teen speech patterns ('totally valid', 'sucks', 'afterthought') without trying too hard"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person advisory language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' - uses observational third-person tone ('Sometimes it helps...') rather than personal perspective",
      "Practical advice is vague - suggests analyzing patterns but doesn't offer concrete next steps or specific phrases they could use",
      "Could benefit from explicitly stating 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar first-person supportive closing"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - perfectly balances acknowledging the hurt ('second choice', 'afterthought') with validation ('Your feelings about this are totally valid') without being patronizing",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice specificity - identifies the problem well but offers only analytical suggestions (figure out the pattern) rather than concrete actionable steps or scripts for what to do next",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent natural prose throughout with no formatting crutches. Uses paragraph breaks logically to separate validation, analysis, question, and closing support. Reads exactly like a supportive friend texting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective to advice sections - instead of 'Sometimes it helps to figure out...' try 'I think the first step is figuring out...' or 'I'd suggest looking at whether...' to feel more personal and supportive",
      "Include 1-2 concrete, actionable suggestions like specific phrases they could say to the friend or concrete boundaries they could set, rather than just suggesting they analyze the pattern",
      "Consider adding 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar first-person availability statement to reinforce the supportive relationship"
