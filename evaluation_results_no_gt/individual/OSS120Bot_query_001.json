    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using vivid, relatable language like 'heart-stopper moment' and 'makes your stomach do a flip' that perfectly captures the teen's embarrassment",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing for deflecting with humor ('Hey, I'm starting a new trend—mix-match shoes!') and practical solutions like slipping shoes under the desk",
      "Maintains 100% natural prose format with zero bullet points, reading like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured guide"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' to strengthen the personal connection, as the advice section uses more imperative phrasing",
      "The third paragraph containing all practical advice is slightly dense and could be broken into two shorter paragraphs for better mobile readability"

      "Break the third paragraph into two separate paragraphs—one for the humor approach and one for the physical solutions (hiding/swapping shoes)—to improve mobile readability",
      "Add explicit first-person framing to advice statements, such as changing 'If you can, try playing it off' to 'I'd probably try playing it off' to enhance the conversational, personal tone"
