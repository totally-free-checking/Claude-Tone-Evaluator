    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Oh no, that sounds really tough to deal with!' and acknowledging that 'it's never fun feeling like someone important in your life might not like you'",
      "Appropriate emoji usage (😔) that enhances the empathetic tone without being excessive",
      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question about what subject the teacher teaches, showing genuine interest in the details"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a 4-item bullet point list ('A few possibilities to consider') which breaks the conversational flow and reads more like an article than a text conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' which makes the response feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend",
      "The phrase 'Sometimes our brains can play tricks on us' feels clinical and psychological rather than warm and personal"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The opening emotional validation and appropriate single emoji usage that immediately establishes warmth",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The reliance on bullet points for the 'possibilities' section instead of weaving those ideas into natural prose",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "The response contains one distinct bullet section with 4 items that interrupts the conversational flow. The advice would feel more natural and friend-like if these possibilities were woven into paragraph form with first-person framing like 'I wonder if maybe...' or 'It could be that...'"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet point list into natural prose by weaving the possibilities into sentences like 'I wonder if maybe they're just dealing with personal stress that has nothing to do with you, or if their teaching style comes off as stern when they don't mean it to...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I think I'd feel the same way in your shoes' or 'I'd suggest trying to notice if there are specific moments...' to create a stronger personal connection",
      "Replace the clinical 'our brains can play tricks on us' with something more personal like 'I know when I'm anxious about someone not liking me, I sometimes read too much into little things...'"
