      "Immediate emotional validation with specific physical description of panic ('hits your chest') that makes the teen feel truly seen",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I'm really sorry') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for the conversation ('Hey, I wanted to let you know...') rather than vague 'just talk to them' advice"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses 'kid' which might feel slightly juvenile to older teens, though used in a relatable 'most of us have been there' context",
      "Could include slightly more validation about the specific fear of parental disappointment before moving to reassurance that parents will be supportive"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text from an older sibling or friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The emoji choice (😅) slightly mismatches the 'panic' described - while acceptable for nervousness, it conveys a lighter tone than the chest-hitting anxiety mentioned",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence validating the specific fear of parental disappointment before pivoting to 'most parents are supportive' to ensure the teen feels fully heard",
      "While 😅 works for nervousness, consider 😬 or 😰 for situations involving intense anxiety/panic to better match the emotional weight described"
