      "Practical advice is somewhat generic and philosophical ('focus on getting even better,' 'explore a different path') rather than offering specific, concrete actions the teen can take right now",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to enhance the empathetic tone, though the absence is still appropriate for the serious topic"
