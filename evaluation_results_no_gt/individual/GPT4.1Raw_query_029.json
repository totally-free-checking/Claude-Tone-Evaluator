    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads like a text message",
      "Strong opening validation that immediately acknowledges the embarrassment and hurt ('Getting yelled at in front of others can feel awful')",
      "Uses first-person language naturally ('I'm really sorry', 'I'm here for you') creating personal connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No follow-up question to continue the conversation - ends with a statement rather than engaging the user to share more",
      "Advice is somewhat generic and adult-oriented ('approach your coach later for a calm conversation') without specific scripts or teen-realistic strategies",
      "Lacks casual, relatable language markers that would make it feel more peer-like ('Ugh, that's mortifying', 'I'd be dying inside')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with perfect paragraph structure and zero bullet points",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - completely missing an actual question to continue the dialogue",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "End with a specific, natural question like 'What exactly did they yell about?' or 'Are you worried about going to practice tomorrow?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Replace generic advice like 'have a calm conversation' with specific teen-friendly scripts: 'If you want to talk to them, maybe try saying something like...'",
      "Add one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to soften the validation and match the emotional tone of embarrassment",
      "Use more casual validating language like 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling' or 'I totally get why you'd want to disappear' instead of 'it's normal to feel embarrassed'"
