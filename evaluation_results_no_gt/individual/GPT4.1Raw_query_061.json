    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('That's such a relatable feeling!') that acknowledges the excitement and confusion of crushes",
      "Uses conversational language and contractions naturally without being overly formal"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it,' or 'I'm here' to create personal connection",
      "Too brief and vague on practical advice - mentions 'looking for clues' but gives no specific examples of what those clues might be",
      "Ends with multiple questions that feel slightly scattered rather than one focused engaging question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - perfectly avoids bullet points and structured lists, flowing as a single conversational paragraph",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create intimacy: try 'I totally get that confusing feeling' or 'I'd say look for how they act around you specifically'",
      "Expand with one concrete example of a 'hint' to make the advice actionable, like mentioning if they text back quickly or find excuses to sit near you",
      "Consolidate the ending into one specific follow-up question rather than multiple questions, such as 'What's one thing they've done that made you wonder if they like you back?'"
