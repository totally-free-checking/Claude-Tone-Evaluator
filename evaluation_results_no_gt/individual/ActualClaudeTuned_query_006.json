    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation and first-person empathy: 'Ugh, I'm so sorry - that post-test panic is the worst!' followed by the perfectly placed 😅 emoji",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I'd try,' 'I know,' 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection rather than impersonal advice-giving",
      "Excellent specific empathy showing deep understanding of the teen experience: 'It's like your brain immediately starts replaying every question you weren't sure about, right?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transitions relatively quickly from validation to advice; could use one more sentence of pure emotional acknowledgment before moving to solutions",
      "The phrase 'accessible in the moment' in paragraph 2 is slightly more clinical/formal compared to the otherwise casual tone",
      "Assumes the teen studied ('if you studied at all beforehand') which might not apply to all situations, though phrased gently enough to not feel judgmental"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and emoji usage - maintains perfect conversational paragraph structure with zero bullets or over-formatting, using exactly one well-placed emoji (😅) that enhances warmth without being excessive",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The balance between support and solutions leans slightly toward practical advice; the validation is strong but brief compared to the two paragraphs of perspective and advice that follow",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph structure with natural transitions between ideas. No headers, bold text, numbered lists, or bullet points. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out, perfectly matching the ideal teen texting format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one more sentence of pure validation before offering perspective (e.g., 'It's totally valid to feel that way right now') to strengthen the emotional support before moving to solutions",
      "Consider adding one specific grounding technique for the panic (like the 5-4-3-2-1 method) alongside the general distraction advice to give them an immediate tool for the anxiety",
      "The follow-up question is good, but could be slightly more open-ended like 'What part felt the hardest?' to invite more emotional sharing rather than just factual assessment"
