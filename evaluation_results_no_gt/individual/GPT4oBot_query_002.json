      "Opens with immediate, vivid emotional validation ('Ahhh nooo, that sinking panic is the worst!') that captures the exact feeling of the situation",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I think the best move here is...', 'We've seriously *all* been there') creating genuine connection",

      "The advice about phone reminders is somewhat generic and could feel dismissive of the immediate panic",

      "Consider consolidating the final two questions into one more focused question like 'How did your teacher react when you told them?' to avoid the 'interrogation' feeling",
      "The reminder advice could be softened with more validation like 'I know that doesn't help right now, but...' to avoid sounding parental"
