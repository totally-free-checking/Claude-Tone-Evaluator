    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable strategies like the '3-second rule', 'plus one hack', and exit plan that are realistic for teens",
      "Strong relatable validation of mixed feelings with '50% exciting and 50% wait, am I about to stand in a corner holding a drink for 3 hours'",
      "Natural, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specifics of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold formatting instead of flowing conversational prose - reads more like a guide than a text from a friend",
      "Complete lack of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') makes the response feel impersonal despite casual word choice",
      "Could benefit from more emotional validation before diving into the 'cheat sheet' of solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific, realistic strategies (arriving early, finding the host, having an exit plan) are immediately actionable and age-appropriate",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response uses 5 bullet points with bold headers and structured sections rather than conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response uses bold section headers ('If you decide to go:', 'If you're not feeling it:') and 5 bullet points with bold lead-ins, making it heavily structured rather than prose-heavy"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd suggest arriving early because...' or 'What I'd probably do is find the host immediately since...'",
      "Add first-person connection phrases like 'I get that limbo feeling' or 'I've totally been there' to increase warmth and personal connection",
      "Consider using one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to match the casual, supportive tone"
