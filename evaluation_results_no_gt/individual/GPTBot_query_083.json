      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice with concrete phrases the teen can actually use (e.g., 'Are you flirting with me or are you just very charming?')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - reads like an impersonal wiki article rather than a supportive friend",
      "Heavy over-structuring with markdown headers (###), bold text, and bullet lists makes it feel like a guide rather than a text conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace the bullet lists with natural conversational paragraphs - instead of listing 'Signs it's flirting' as bullets, write it as: 'I usually look for patterns. Like, do they seek you out specifically, or are they just friendly to everyone? And pay attention to whether they remember little details about you...'",
      "Add first-person connection and emotional validation upfront: 'Ugh, that's such a confusing spot to be in! I totally get why you're second-guessing everything - I've been there too. It's honestly the worst when you can't tell if someone actually likes you or is just super friendly...'",
      "Remove all markdown headers (###) and bold formatting (**). If you need to separate ideas, use natural transitions like 'Another thing to watch for...' or 'On the flip side...' instead of section headers"
