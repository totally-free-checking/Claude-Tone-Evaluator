    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'Ugh nooo' and 'my soul left my body' that perfectly captures the embarrassment",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('sorry, long day') and concrete actions ('grab your paper, ask your question')",
      "Natural emoji usage with one well-placed 😅 that enhances the warm, embarrassed-but-supportive tone"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses slightly impersonal phrasing ('the best move is usually') rather than first-person perspective ('I'd probably just...' or 'I think...')",
      "Could include more explicit first-person language throughout (like 'I get it' or 'I'm here if you need to talk') to strengthen the personal connection"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language consistency - while it opens with 'I'm so sorry,' the advice section shifts to impersonal phrasing ('the best move is usually') rather than maintaining the first-person perspective ('I'd say the best move is...')",

      "Add first-person framing to the advice section, changing 'the best move is usually' to 'I'd probably just...' or 'I think the best thing is...' to maintain the personal, friend-to-friend connection",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing before the question to reinforce supportive presence"
