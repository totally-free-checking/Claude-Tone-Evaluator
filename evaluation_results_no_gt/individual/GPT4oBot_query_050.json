    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual, empathetic language ('Ugh, that's such a tough situation—I'm so sorry', 'That sucks, honestly')",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including an exact script the teen could use ('Hey, I know we don't really talk much, but let's try to make this project easy on both of us')",
      "Maintains natural prose format throughout with zero bullet points or over-formatting, reading like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more explicit first-person perspective in the advice section (uses 'You could try' rather than 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you should')",
      "The follow-up question is technically a compound question (two questions joined by 'or'), which slightly dilutes the conversational flow compared to a single focused question"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Integrate more first-person language when giving advice, such as 'I'd probably start with...' or 'I think the best approach is...' to create stronger personal connection",

      "Simplify the final question to a single inquiry rather than an either/or structure to feel more natural"
