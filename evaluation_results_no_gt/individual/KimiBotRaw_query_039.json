    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation: 'That sounds really heavy to carry' and 'Having your parents expect 'perfect' when you're already doing your best is exhausting' immediately acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts for difficult conversations like 'I'll tell you when report cards come out, but talking about it every day makes me anxious'",
      "Ends with an engaging, specific follow-up question about the parents' motivations that invites deeper conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers (**Try the 'translation' approach**, **Define 'good enough' for yourself**, etc.) that function as bullet points, creating a structured list rather than natural prose flow",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - the response never uses 'I' statements, making it feel like an article rather than a supportive friend texting",
      "The four bold sections create a 'self-help article' format rather than conversational paragraphs"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides realistic, specific phrases the teen can actually use with parents and acknowledges their limited agency while offering concrete strategies",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - relies heavily on bold headers and structured sections that read like a listicle rather than flowing conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "While not using traditional bullet points, the response uses four bold headers (**Try the 'translation' approach**, **Define 'good enough' for yourself**, **Set boundaries (yes, really)**, **Remember the long game**) that serve the same function as a bulleted list, breaking the flow into discrete sections rather than natural paragraphs"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as flowing prose paragraphs instead of bold headers - for example, combine the ideas into 2-3 paragraphs that naturally transition between concepts using phrases like 'One thing I've found helpful is...' or 'You might also try...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I think the translation approach works because...' or 'I'd say your feelings are totally valid here' to create the sense of a real person connecting with them",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a casual, supportive tone appropriate for the heavy subject matter"
