    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd say') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose format with natural conversational flow - no bullets, headers, or over-formatting",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation starting with 'Ugh, that's so stressful!' and normalizing the feeling of being behind"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice, while solid, could be slightly more specific (e.g., suggesting exact questions to ask a guidance counselor or how to find class descriptions)",
      "Lacks emoji which could have enhanced warmth, though the text conveys warmth effectively through words alone"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational first-person tone - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any structured lists or formal language",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice section is slightly generic regarding counselor interaction; could offer more concrete scripting or specific steps for researching classes",

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to visually reinforce the warm tone, though the current text-only approach works well",
      "Enhance the practical advice by suggesting specific conversation starters for the guidance counselor (e.g., 'I'm interested in X but worried about Y - what do you think?') or mentioning specific resources like course catalogs"
