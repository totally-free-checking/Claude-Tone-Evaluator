    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation: 'That sounds really heavy' and 'no room to breathe or be human' acknowledges the emotional weight effectively",
      "Practical advice is excellent and specific - includes actual conversation scripts ('I want to do well, but the pressure...'), concrete time blocks ('90 minutes/day'), and realistic strategies like 'good enough' thresholds"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' makes it feel impersonal and instructional rather than supportive",
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points (6 main bullets with sub-bullets) and bold formatting makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Validation is limited to the first two sentences before immediately pivoting to 'Here are a few ways...' - doesn't maintain emotional support throughout"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - it offers specific, actionable strategies including exact phrases to use with parents and concrete study systems that are realistic for a teen's situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The prose vs. bullets dimension - it uses extensive bullet points, bold text, and numbered lists rather than natural conversational paragraphs, making it feel like a wikiHow article instead of a supportive text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response contains 6 main bullet points with internal bold formatting and sub-examples, plus 2 numbered questions at the end. Only the first two sentences are prose. Heavy use of bold text (**Name what**, **Try a calm**, etc.) creates a structured, instructional feel rather than conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural prose paragraphs instead of bullet points - flow the advice conversationally: 'I'd suggest trying to name what perfect is costing you first. When I think about systems vs. grades...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: 'I get how overwhelming that feels', 'I'd probably start by...', 'I'm wondering if...' - currently it uses entirely second-person instructional language",
      "Integrate emotional validation throughout the response rather than front-loading it - check in between advice sections with phrases like 'That anxiety is so valid though' or 'I know that sounds easier said than done'"
