    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally in conversational paragraphs",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (bringing a book/doodling, specific phrase 'Mind if I sit here?')",
      "Appropriate single emoji usage (😊) at the end that enhances warmth without being excessive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No follow-up question to continue the conversation - ends abruptly without engaging the user to share more",
      "Lacks first-person language and connection - uses impersonal phrasing like 'Here's something to keep in mind' and 'Alternatively' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd say'",
      "Opening validation 'Ah, I'm sorry to hear you're feeling that way' feels somewhat clinical/formal rather than warmly conversational"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - reads like a text message rather than a self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing follow-up question - fails to invite the teen to continue the conversation or share more details about their situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end like 'Do you usually sit with friends, or is today different?' or 'What feels like the hardest part about sitting alone?' to keep the conversation going",
      "Replace impersonal transitions like 'Alternatively' and 'Here's something to keep in mind' with first-person language like 'Or, if it were me, I'd...' or 'I think the best thing might be...' to create a more personal connection",
      "Consider a warmer, more immediate opening like 'Ugh, that sinking feeling when you realize you're sitting alone? I totally get that' instead of the more formal 'Ah, I'm sorry to hear you're feeling that way'"
