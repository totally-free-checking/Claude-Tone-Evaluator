    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd maybe try', 'I really think') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and acknowledging the overthinking tendency",
      "Specific, contextual follow-up question distinguishing between in-person and text behavior"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji slightly mismatches the 'frustrating' emotion (suggests nervous laughter/awkwardness rather than empathy for frustration)",
      "Could offer one additional specific script for if the friend responds defensively or continues being vague",
      "Advice about giving space could be slightly more specific on timeframe (e.g., 'a day or two' vs 'a little space')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person perspective ('I'd say', 'I think') that sounds like a supportive older sibling texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice (😅) doesn't perfectly align with validating frustration - a 😕 or 💙 might better match the emotional tone",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Excellent pure prose format with 4 natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider matching emoji to emotional validation more precisely - 😅 implies nervousness/awkwardness while 😟 or 😕 might better convey empathy for frustration",
      "Add one more specific phrase option for the follow-up conversation, such as what to say if they respond 'I'm fine' but clearly aren't",
      "Specify a concrete timeframe for 'giving space' (e.g., 'wait a day or two') to make the advice more actionable"
