    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('this is way more common than you think') and reframes guilt as evidence of being a good person",
      "Excellent follow-up questions at the end that are specific to the situation and invite deeper reflection",
      "Good balance of emotional support and practical frameworks (guilt check, situation assessment)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers (**The guilt check:**, **What's your situation?**, etc.) that function as bullet points, breaking conversational flow",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - reads as impersonal advice rather than a friend sharing perspective",
      "No emojis used where one might enhance warmth (though absence is acceptable, a single warm emoji could help)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Balance of support and solutions - validates feelings first, offers concrete frameworks for untangling the situation, then re-engages with questions",

      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold headers (**The guilt check:**, **What's your situation?**, **The 'why' behind the feelings:**) that act as bullet sections. While content under each is prose, the headers create a structured, list-like format rather than continuous conversational text"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove the bold headers and integrate the three sections into flowing paragraphs - instead of **The guilt check:**, try 'I think a good first step is checking whether you're actually doing anything that hurts someone...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - use phrases like 'I'd say', 'I think', or 'I'm wondering' instead of general statements like 'That changes the landscape'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to match the casual, supportive tone"
