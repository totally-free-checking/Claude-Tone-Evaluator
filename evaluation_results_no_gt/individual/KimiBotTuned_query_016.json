    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person advisory language like 'I'd text your coach ASAP' and 'I'd say' which creates a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word scripts the teen can use ('I completely forgot we had practice today...' and 'I messed up and forgot I had practice...') making the advice immediately actionable",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—it reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question combines two questions ('What kind of practice is it... and what's the other thing...') which slightly dilutes the focus, though it remains conversational",
      "Could include one additional validating phrase after the advice to reinforce emotional support before the closing question, though the balance is already quite good"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points—maintains conversational flow throughout while embedding practical advice within paragraphs rather than lists",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The closing question is slightly compound (asking about both the practice type and the other plan simultaneously), which could feel marginally less focused than a single specific question",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences and paragraphs, maintaining a text-message-like conversational structure throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief validating sign-off before the final question (e.g., 'No matter what you choose, you're handling it') to reinforce emotional support after the practical advice",
      "The suggested text scripts are excellent—continue using this technique of providing exact phrases teens can copy/paste or adapt"
