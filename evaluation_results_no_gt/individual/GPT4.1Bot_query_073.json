    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I totally get how annoying that is!' which acknowledges the frustration right away",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd maybe try...', 'I totally get') creating authentic connection",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for the teen to use: 'Hey, can we just talk about stuff without making it a contest?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one well-placed emoji (like 😅 or 😤) early on to enhance visual warmth, though the 'Ugh' effectively conveys emotion",
      "The follow-up contains two questions which slightly risks feeling like an interrogation, though they flow naturally as related inquiries"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while zero emojis is acceptable, one strategic emoji could have enhanced the warm tone for this frustrating situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, lists, or structural formatting. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs using phrases like 'If I were you, I'd maybe try...' rather than listing steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one emoji at the start (like 😅) to visually signal warmth, though the text alone is already warm",
      "The advice to 'play it down or even just change the subject' is excellent - could optionally expand slightly on what 'playing it down' looks like in practice, though the specific script provided compensates well"
