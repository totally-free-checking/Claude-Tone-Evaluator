      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text message",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks natural first-person perspective phrases like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' that create personal connection",
      "Suggested dialogue ('affecting me in a negative way') is overly formal and clinical for teen conversation",

      "Add first-person perspective like 'Honestly, I think parents sometimes forget...' or 'I'd say start with...' to sound more like a supportive friend"
