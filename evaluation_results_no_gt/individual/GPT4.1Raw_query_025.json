    "strengths": [
      "Uses pure prose with no bullet points or formatting, matching the conversational text style",
      "Validates feelings immediately with 'That sounds frustrating' and acknowledges the lack of agency"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely brief (only 2 sentences) - feels dismissive rather than supportive for the ideal 2-4 paragraph length",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd be annoyed', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and detached",
      "No practical advice offered - only asks what happened without offering any immediate coping strategies or validation depth",
      "Missing emoji that could enhance warmth for such a short response",
      "Uses somewhat formal phrasing like 'decisions are made about your life without your input' instead of casual teen-appropriate language like 'ugh, moms can be so extra sometimes'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullets, though the extreme brevity makes it feel more like a text message ping than a substantive response"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand to 2-3 paragraphs with deeper validation ('I'd be so annoyed if my mom did that without asking') followed by one concrete suggestion for how to approach the conversation",
      "Add natural first-person language throughout ('I think you should...', 'I'd probably feel...', 'I'm here to help figure this out') to create personal connection",
      "Include one emoji (like 😅 or 😬) early in the response to set a warm, casual tone since the text is so short",
      "Offer at least one piece of immediate actionable advice before asking the follow-up question, such as suggesting they take a breath before reacting or how to start the conversation with their mom"
