    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong use of first-person language and contractions ('I know', 'mix things up', 'you'll laugh') creating authentic conversational flow",
      "Immediate emotional validation normalizing the experience ('it happens to almost everyone', 'I know it feels embarrassing')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Teases practical advice ('Want some tips?') without actually providing any concrete strategies in the response",
      "Follow-up question is closed-ended (yes/no) rather than open-ended to encourage deeper sharing",
      "Could more directly acknowledge the intensity of 'wanting to disappear' with slightly deeper validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - perfectly avoids bullet points and over-structuring while maintaining warm, casual language",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice delivery - asks if the user wants tips rather than immediately offering 1-2 concrete suggestions to help with the immediate distress",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or over-structuring. Text flows naturally as conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Provide 1-2 immediate concrete tips within the response (e.g., 'I'd probably just laugh and say \"sorry, brain fart!\" - keeping it light usually works best') rather than only asking if they want tips",
      "Add one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 😊) to enhance the friendly tone for this lighthearted-but-embarrassing situation",
      "Transform the closing question to be more open-ended and specific, such as 'How are you feeling about facing them in class tomorrow?' instead of the yes/no 'Want some tips?'"
