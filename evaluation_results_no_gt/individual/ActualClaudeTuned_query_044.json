    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst!' and 'we've all been there' that normalizes the experience",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a supportive friend texting",
      "Excellent use of first-person language ('I think you're probably overthinking,' 'we've all been there') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for talking to the teacher: 'Sorry I blanked earlier - I actually did the reading but just got nervous'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transitions quickly from validation to reassurance that 'it probably felt way more dramatic to you,' which could slightly minimize the immediate embarrassment before fully sitting with it",
      "The suggestion to approach the teacher after class, while good, assumes a certain comfort level with teacher interaction that not all teens have"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining readability and warmth",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight rush from emotional validation to cognitive reframing (perspective that others aren't judging) could benefit from one more sentence acknowledging how cringey the moment feels",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no formatting gimmicks, bullet lists, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure emotional validation before the perspective shift to 'others aren't judging you' to fully honor the embarrassment before reframing",
      "The optional nature of the teacher conversation advice ('you could always') is good, but could acknowledge that it's totally okay not to say anything too - sometimes silence is also a valid choice"
