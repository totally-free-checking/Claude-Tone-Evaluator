    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I'm so sorry', 'I get it') that creates genuine peer-like connection rather than distant authority",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable micro-steps (opening the doc, writing the title, 10-minute timer, 'allowed to quit') that are realistic and immediately implementable for an overwhelmed teen",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural supportive text message with conversational flow"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Absence of emoji when one might enhance warmth for a stressed teen (though 0 is within acceptable range, a 😅 or similar could add visual warmth)",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) near the opening to visually signal empathy for a stressed user, though the text-only approach is still effective",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be split into two sentences for easier readability on mobile, though the current length is acceptable"
