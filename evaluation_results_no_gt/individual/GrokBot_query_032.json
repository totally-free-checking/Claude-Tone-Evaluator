    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that sucks so much' and 'I totally get that sinking feeling' that acknowledges the specific anxiety of not knowing why someone is upset",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I've been there') creating genuine connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable script ('Hey, everything okay between us? You've seemed a bit off') that teens can actually use in the moment"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'it might not even be something you did' could potentially minimize the teen's intuition, though it balances this by validating that 'it feels way bigger in the moment'",
      "Slightly verbose in the middle paragraph where it explains why people clam up, though this does provide helpful perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The conversational prose format and first-person language - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with natural contractions, casual phrasing ('low-key', 'give 'em'), and no bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Nothing significantly diverges from the ideal; if anything, the response could be slightly more concise, but the length is still within the ideal 2-4 paragraph range",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural conversational paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue providing specific scripts or phrases teens can use, as the 'Hey, everything okay between us?' example is incredibly helpful",
      "The balance of validation-to-advice ratio is excellent here - maintain this pattern of validating first, then offering the 'If I were you' perspective"
