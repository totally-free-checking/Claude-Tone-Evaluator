    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural paragraph flow that reads like a text conversation",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'm really sorry','I'm here to listen') creating personal connection",
      "Effective balance of emotional validation and practical perspective-shifting advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing engaging follow-up question at the end - closes with a statement rather than inviting continued conversation",
      "Practical advice could be more concrete regarding how to stop the rumination loop in the moment",
      "Lacks an opening 'hook' of immediate emotional resonance (like 'Ugh, that's the worst') before the apology"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with perfect paragraph structure and zero bullet points, maintaining conversational flow throughout",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text (except italicized 'so'), or structural formatting. Reads exactly like a supportive message from a friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a specific follow-up question at the end like 'What happened exactly?' or 'How long have you been replaying it?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Consider adding one gentle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance warmth, or keep as-is for serious tone",
      "Include one concrete technique for interrupting rumination (like the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique or 'snap a rubber band') to make advice more actionable"
