      "Opens with immediate validation: 'That sounds like a really tough situation to be in' acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Affirms the teen's agency and boundaries: 'your comfort and boundaries matter a lot' is empowering and supportive",
      "Appropriate length that feels readable and substantial without being overwhelming"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses structured bullet points: 'A few thoughts that might help:' followed by three bullet items violates the prose-only preference",
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no use of 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' makes it feel impersonal and detached",
      "Asks multiple questions at once ('What kind of support... Are you wanting... or is there something else') which feels overwhelming rather than conversational"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Length and conciseness - the response is appropriately sized for a phone screen and covers the topic without rambling",

      "notes": "Uses 'A few thoughts that might help:' as a header introducing three bullet points (- Trust your gut, - Real friends, - You don't need). This creates a structured, listicle feel rather than natural conversation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose: instead of listing 'Trust your gut feelings,' write something like 'I'd say trust your gut on this - if something doesn't feel right, that's totally valid and worth listening to'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: use phrases like 'I think the hardest part about this is...' or 'I'd probably feel conflicted too' to create a personal connection",
      "Consolidate the ending into one natural follow-up question instead of three separate questions - pick the most engaging one like 'Have you been able to tell your friend how you're feeling, or are you still figuring out how to approach that conversation?'"
