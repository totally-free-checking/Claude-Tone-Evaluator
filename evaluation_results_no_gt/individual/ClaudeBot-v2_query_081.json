    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying' and acknowledgment of feeling 'cranky and overwhelmed'",
      "Uses first-person advice format naturally ('If I were you, I'd...') making it feel like peer support rather than lecturing",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the conversation: 'Hey lol I keep getting your snaps at like 2am—can you send them earlier?'",
      "Excellent follow-up question that explores the friendship dynamic ('Do you think they're doing it just because they're up late, or does it feel like they're trying to get your attention specifically?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include slightly more explicit first-person supportive language like 'I get it' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense; could break into two shorter paragraphs for better mobile readability"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly limited use of explicit first-person emotional support phrases (e.g., 'I'm here for you') though the tone is warm",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using 'or' and 'and then' transitions rather than list formatting."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one brief first-person support statement like 'I'm here if you need to vent more' or 'I get how frustrating that is' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "The third paragraph could be split after '...notifications at night.' to create more white space for mobile readability, though the content is excellent"
