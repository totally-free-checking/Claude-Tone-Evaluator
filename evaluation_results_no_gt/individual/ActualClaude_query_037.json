    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a casual text conversation",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Oh wow, that can be such an uncomfortable feeling' and 'sitting heavy on your mind'",
      "Appropriate restraint with emojis (none used) for this sensitive topic while maintaining warmth through language"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person connection language like 'I think,' 'I'd feel,' or 'I get it' - uses only 'I can imagine' once, feeling slightly impersonal",
      "Asks three questions at once (How are you feeling/Was it clear/Want to talk), which can feel overwhelming rather than engaging",
      "Very light on practical advice or concrete coping strategies, offering only the cognitive insight about 'filling in blanks' without actionable steps"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, creating a conversational flow that feels like texting a friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Insufficient balance of practical advice - focuses almost entirely on emotional validation and questioning without offering concrete strategies for handling the situation",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs, no lists or headers, maintains conversational flow throughout"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person connection statements like 'I'd be totally spiraling if that happened to me' or 'I think you're handling this really well by reaching out' to create more personal connection",
      "Consolidate the multiple questions into one specific follow-up like 'Do you want to tell me what you overheard, or is it too raw right now?' to avoid overwhelming the user",
      "Include one concrete coping strategy before the questions, such as 'Maybe try writing down exactly what words you heard vs. what you're worried they meant - sometimes seeing it on paper helps clarify if it's as bad as it feels'"
