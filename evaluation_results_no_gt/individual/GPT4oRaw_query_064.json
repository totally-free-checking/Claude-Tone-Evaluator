    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using first-person language: 'Oh no, I'm so sorry you're feeling this way—it sounds really stressful'",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice realistic for a teen's situation (checking locker, asking friends, going to lost and found)",
      "Uses natural conversational language with contractions and first-person perspective throughout ('I can think of more ideas', 'You've got this')",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging follow-up question that invites continued conversation: 'Do you know roughly where you might have left it?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points for the retracing steps questions which breaks the conversational prose format ('- Where were you last...', '- Did you move around...')",
      "The phrase 'but don't worry!' could feel slightly dismissive of the valid anxiety about losing something important",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji to enhance the supportive tone given the user is 'freaking out'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, immediately actionable steps that respect a teen's agency and school environment",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - uses bullet points for questions instead of integrating them into natural paragraph flow",

      "prose_percentage": "85%",
      "notes": "Two bullet points used for questions under 'retrace your steps' section. These should be integrated into the prose as natural follow-up questions rather than formatted as a list."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove the bullet points and integrate the questions into the prose naturally: 'First, I'd suggest retracing your steps. Where were you last when you had the item? Did you move around a lot during school?'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to match the emotional intensity of 'freaking out'",
      "Replace 'but don't worry!' with something more validating like 'but we'll figure this out together' to avoid minimizing their feelings"
