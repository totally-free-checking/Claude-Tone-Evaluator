    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that sounds so invasive and frustrating' and 'that sinking feeling sucks' that normalize the emotional impact",
      "Strong first-person conversational language throughout ('I'd start by,' 'I think owning your feelings,' 'I totally get why') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script ('Hey, I don't like comments about my body, so please stop') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from emotional validation to practical advice in paragraph 3 could be slightly smoother with a bridging phrase like 'If you're looking for ways to handle this'",
      "The advice to talk to a trusted adult, while appropriate, is somewhat standard and could include more specific guidance on how to approach that conversation"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs, no headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief transitional phrase between validation and advice like 'Here's what I'd try' to maintain the conversational flow",
      "The follow-up question is good but could be slightly more open-ended like 'What's your gut telling you about how to handle this with them?' to invite deeper sharing",
      "Consider acknowledging the specific power dynamics if this is a peer vs. authority figure earlier in the response"
