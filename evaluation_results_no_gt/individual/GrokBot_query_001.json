      "Immediate emotional validation with specific language ('that sinking feeling when you realize it too late') that perfectly captures the awkwardness of the moment",
      "Excellent use of first-person experience sharing ('I've totally been there myself') creating instant rapport and reducing shame",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice including specific scripts the teen can actually use ('Whoops, fashion fail today!')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to practical advice could include one more bridging phrase like 'I get why that feels huge right now' to soften the shift",
      "While 'I'd try' is good first-person language, adding one 'I think' or 'In my experience' could strengthen the personal connection even more"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural elements - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting back with paragraphs that flow conversationally",

      "Consider adding a brief 'I get it' or 'I know that feeling' type phrase right before the practical advice to create an even smoother bridge between emotional support and solutions",
