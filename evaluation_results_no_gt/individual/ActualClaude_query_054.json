    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation: 'That sounds really frustrating and uncomfortable - I'm sorry you're dealing with that' acknowledges the emotional weight immediately",
      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can use like 'I don't want to hear comments about my body' and 'That makes me uncomfortable, please stop'",
      "Ends with an engaging, context-specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest in understanding the situation better"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers ('Setting boundaries:', 'Depending on the situation:', 'Remember:') makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout the advice section - uses 'You could try' and 'You might want' instead of 'I think you could' or 'I'd probably suggest', making it feel impersonal",
      "Missing emojis that could enhance warmth for this sensitive topic - a simple 💙 or 😔 would help convey emotional support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end is natural and engaging, asking specifically about whether it's someone close or a workplace/school situation to help figure out the best approach",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is heavily structured with multiple bullet point sections and headers, completely violating the 'natural prose paragraphs' requirement and making it feel like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response uses three headers ('Setting boundaries:', 'Depending on the situation:', 'Remember:') followed by 7 bullet points. Only the opening sentence and closing question are in prose form. This is exactly the 'self-help article' format the character profile warns against"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in paragraph form - instead of bullet points under headers, flow the advice naturally: 'If you want to set a boundary, I'd probably just say something direct like... Or if it's someone at school, you might need to...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: change 'You could try being direct' to 'I think being direct usually works best - I'd probably say something like...' and 'Sometimes a simple wow works' to 'Honestly, sometimes I just go with a simple wow and change the subject'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early on (like 😔 or 💙) to soften the serious topic, and expand the emotional validation beyond the first sentence to weave it throughout the response"
