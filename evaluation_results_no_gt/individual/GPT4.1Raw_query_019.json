    "strengths": [
      "Provides a specific, usable script for talking to the teacher: 'I understand why matching answers could look suspicious, but I honestly did my own work'",
      "Maintains natural paragraph structure without falling into bullet points or over-formatting",
      "Offers realistic context about why answers might match (studying together, straightforward questions) that validates the user's experience"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective in advice sections - uses impersonal phrasing like 'the best thing you can do' instead of 'I think you should' or 'I'd try'",
      "Opening validation, while present, could be warmer and more immediate ('I'm sorry' is polite but less relatable than 'Ugh, that's such a gut-punch feeling')",
      "Tone shifts to slightly formal/educational in phrases like 'Being open and respectful shows maturity' and 'Teachers usually appreciate honesty'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without bullet points or excessive structure - reads as continuous conversational text",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Limited use of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') and casual conversational markers throughout the advice sections",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with natural flow. The quoted dialogue is integrated naturally within the prose rather than formatted as a list or bullet points."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace formal advice framing like 'the best thing you can do' with first-person perspective like 'I'd probably try to' or 'I think you should' to sound more like a supportive friend",
      "Add more casual emotional validation upfront like 'Ugh, that's such a stressful spot' or 'I get why you'd feel panicked' before moving to explanatory or solution-oriented language",
      "Make the follow-up question more conversational and specific: instead of 'Is there anything specific you want help with,' try 'Are you planning to talk to them face-to-face or email them first?'"
