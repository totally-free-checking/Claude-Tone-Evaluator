      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledgment of physical tension ('makes your whole body feel tense')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs like 'If you can, try to make a little buffer for yourself right now'",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to a teen's immediate situation (headphones/white noise, moving to bathroom/porch/hallway, texting friends)"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more first-person language in the advice section (uses 'try to' and 'it helps' rather than 'I'd suggest' or 'I think')",
