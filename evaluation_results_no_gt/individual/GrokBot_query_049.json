    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I'd try', 'I think') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('hey, what's up?') and concrete steps (jotting down thoughts, smiling back)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens by calling it the 'best kind of problem' which slightly minimizes the anxiety before fully validating the overthinking spiral",
      "Could provide slightly more validation about how exhausting overthinking can feel before moving to the reframe"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose flow with conversational first-person language and zero formatting structure - perfectly matches the 'texting with a supportive friend' aesthetic",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The immediate framing as a 'best kind of problem' in the opening line, while warm, slightly rushes past the validation of how stressful overthinking actually feels",

      "Consider adding one more sentence validating how exhausting the mental spiral feels before calling it the 'best kind of problem' to ensure the teen feels fully heard",
      "The current emoji placement is good, but consider if the tone would work without it or if a different supportive emoji (like 💙) might feel slightly more empathetic for anxiety"
