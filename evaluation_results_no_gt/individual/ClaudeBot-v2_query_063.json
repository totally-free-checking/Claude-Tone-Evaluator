    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific, relatable language ('that instant \"oh no\" moment when every head turns is genuinely the worst')",
      "Excellent use of first-person perspective throughout ('I'd want to teleport out of there', 'I’d just do a quick, casual...') creating authentic connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice ('Honestly though, it feels way bigger than it is') could slightly soften the pivot to avoid minimizing the immediate embarrassment, though the balance is still strong",

      "The closing question could be slightly more open-ended like 'How are you feeling about it now?' to invite broader emotional sharing rather than just factual details about the location"
