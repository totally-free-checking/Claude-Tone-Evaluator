    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual interjection 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' followed by 'I totally get how frustrating it is'",
      "Uses natural first-person advice framing like 'If I were you, I'd probably just keep my answers chill and casual' which feels like peer support",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('just talking to a friend', 'just group chat stuff') rather than vague suggestions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 🙄) early in the response to enhance visual warmth, though the text alone is warm enough",
      "The transition from validation to advice could include one more sentence acknowledging the specific feeling of invasion before moving to 'this happens to everyone'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while zero emojis is acceptable, one well-placed emoji could have enhanced the warm, casual tone for this specific topic about annoying parents",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one emoji at the start (like 'Ugh, that's so annoying! 😅') to visually signal warmth, though the current text-only approach works well",
      "The advice section is strong but could briefly acknowledge that setting boundaries with parents can feel scary before suggesting the direct conversation approach"
