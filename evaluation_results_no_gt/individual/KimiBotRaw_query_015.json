    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that is *so* frustrating', 'makes your blood boil', 'It's valid to be mad') that immediately acknowledges the teen's anger and privacy violation",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (door stopper with alarm, decoy strategy, exact scripts to use with siblings/parents, differentiating between minor/adult living situations)",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question about what specific items are being targeted, showing genuine interest in tailoring the advice further"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with bold headers ('First:', 'tactical damage control:', 'The conversation:') and multiple bullet point sections, reading like a tactical guide rather than a conversational text",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses only imperative instructional language ('Don't accuse', 'Try', 'Loop in your parents'), creating distance rather than connection",
      "Uses zero emojis where one might enhance warmth for this frustrating situation, and relies on bold text formatting instead of natural prose emphasis"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - it offers concrete, teen-realistic strategies (cheap Amazon door stopper, decoy items, specific conversation scripts) that acknowledge their limited agency and family dynamics",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting - it is heavily structured with bold headers, bullet lists, and tactical sections rather than flowing natural paragraphs that feel like texting a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses bold headers to create sections (First, tactical damage control, The conversation, If you're minors/adults) with extensive bullet lists underneath. Only the opening validation and closing question are in natural prose paragraphs. Reads like a self-help article or wikiHow guide rather than a conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural prose paragraphs without bold headers or bullet points - integrate the advice into flowing sentences like 'I'd probably start by taking a walk to cool off, then maybe look into a cheap door alarm...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout to create connection: replace imperative commands like 'Don't accuse' with 'I'd try not to accuse them directly because...' and 'I think the best approach would be...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😤 or 💙) early in the response to match the 'ugh, so frustrating' energy, and remove all bold formatting to maintain conversational text flow"
