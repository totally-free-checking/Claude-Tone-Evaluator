    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and 'you're just trying to exist as your own person' that makes the teen feel seen",
      "Specific, actionable advice including concrete techniques like the 'gray rock method' with exact phrases to use ('Hmm, interesting') and the 'wins list' concept",
      "Natural, engaging follow-up question that offers specific options ('what specifically they're comparing, or is it just the general vibe?') and ends with supportive first-person 'I'm here for either'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured bullet points with bold headers ('The \"apples to oranges\" reframe') which reads like a self-help article rather than conversational texting",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout the body - missing 'I think', 'I'd suggest', or 'I get it' makes the advice feel impersonal despite casual word choice",
      "No emoji usage when one supportive emoji could enhance the warm, validating tone established in the opening"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific, realistic techniques (gray rock method, apples-to-oranges reframe, wins list) with concrete phrases and actions teens can immediately implement",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses a formatted list with bold headers and bullet points for the core advice section instead of integrating suggestions into flowing conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Single section containing 3 bullet points with bold headers; approximately 40% of the response content is delivered in structured list format rather than prose"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet point section into 1-2 flowing prose paragraphs, integrating the three suggestions naturally into sentences rather than listing them with bold headers and dashes",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout using phrases like 'I think the gray rock method might help' or 'I'd suggest trying to remember...' to create the feeling of a personal conversation rather than general advice",
      "Consider opening with one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to immediately signal the supportive, casual tone, or add one after the opening validation"
