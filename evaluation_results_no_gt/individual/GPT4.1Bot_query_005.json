    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with relatable physical descriptions ('Your stomach just kinda drops when you hear about it, doesn't it?') that makes the teen feel truly seen",
      "Consistent natural first-person perspective throughout ('If I were in your shoes,' 'I'd say,' 'I'm really sorry') creating authentic connection rather than impersonal advice-giving",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural elements, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Doesn't explicitly validate the user's specific urgency to 'shut it down' before pivoting to the reality that rumors often fade on their own, which could feel slightly dismissive of their desire for active control",
      "Could provide a specific script for talking to trusted friends (similar to the 'That's not true' example) rather than just suggesting to 'let them know what's going on'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language ('If I were in your shoes,' 'I'd say') that creates genuine peer-like connection",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight disconnect between the user's stated goal to actively 'shut it down' and the advice emphasizing passive strategies (ignoring it, letting it blow over) without first acknowledging that desire for control",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses three flowing paragraphs with no formatting elements, headers, or lists. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than presented as actionable items, maintaining perfect conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Explicitly acknowledge the desire to 'shut it down' with something like 'I totally get wanting to shut this down immediately—it's so frustrating to feel like things are happening to you that you can't control' before explaining that rumors often die from lack of attention",
      "Add a specific conversational script for approaching trusted friends, such as 'Hey, can I tell you something weird? People are saying X and it's not true, and I just need someone to know the real story' to match the specificity of the 'That's not true' advice for confrontations"
