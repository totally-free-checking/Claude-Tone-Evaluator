    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd maybe') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific emotional validation with physical description ('anxious knot in your stomach') that shows deep empathy",
      "Provides concrete, realistic advice including an exact script the teen could use ('I've been feeling overwhelmed...')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question 'What exactly has you feeling on edge...' uses slightly awkward phrasing ('has you feeling' is less common than 'is making you feel')",
      "Could briefly acknowledge specific common fears (like worrying the counselor will tell parents) before asking the question to show deeper understanding"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and structured advice, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider softening the follow-up question to 'What specifically is making you nervous about it?' or 'Is it worrying they'll tell your parents, or something else?' to match the casual tone more closely",
      "Could add one more 'I' statement in the middle section like 'I remember feeling that way too' to strengthen the personal connection, though the existing 'If I were you' works well"
