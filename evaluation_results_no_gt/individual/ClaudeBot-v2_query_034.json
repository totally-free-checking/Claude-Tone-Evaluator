      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and the metaphor about gasoline on a fire, which normalizes the anger",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I'd try,' 'I need you,' 'I'm gonna') creating genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The compound question at the end, while natural, asks two things at once which could slightly dilute the invitation to share",

      "The breathing advice is excellent but could be framed as 'What works for me is...' to make it feel even more like peer sharing rather than instruction"
