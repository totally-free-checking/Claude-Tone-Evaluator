      "Immediate and strong emotional validation using first-person empathy: 'Oh man, I hate that you're feeling that way, and I know that can sting' and 'it's rough to feel like you're present but invisible'",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring; flows like a text conversation",
      "Excellent use of first-person conversational language throughout ('I know', 'I promise', 'we can unpack this') and casual phrasing ('wanna', 'chat it out')",

      "The balance could be improved by adding a brief practical tip or validation technique after the initial emotional support but before the questions, ensuring the teen has something concrete to hold onto while they reflect on your questions"
