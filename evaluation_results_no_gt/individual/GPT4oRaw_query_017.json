    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, reading like a continuous conversation",
      "Provides highly specific actionable advice including exact script wording ('Hey, I had kind of a strange feeling...') that teens can actually use",
      "Appropriate length with three focused paragraphs that are substantial but not overwhelming for mobile reading"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses imperative instructions ('Start by reflecting', 'Try to pinpoint') instead of personal connection ('I'd start by', 'I think you should')",
      "Ends with a statement rather than a follow-up question, missing the opportunity to continue the conversation and show ongoing interest",
      "Minimal emotional validation upfront - only 'That sounds like a tricky situation' before jumping immediately to analytical advice, lacking warmth like 'Ugh, that's so uncomfortable' or 'I totally get that gut feeling'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, maintaining a conversational paragraph flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of follow-up question at the end - fails to engage the user to continue sharing or ask for clarification about their specific situation",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end like 'What specifically gave you that weird vibe?' or 'Do you think you'll mention it to her?' to keep the conversation going",
      "Replace imperative instructions with first-person suggestions: change 'Start by reflecting' to 'I'd start by reflecting' and 'Try to pinpoint' to 'I'd try to pinpoint' to create personal connection",
      "Begin with stronger emotional validation before advice: add something like 'Ugh, that sinking feeling when you get bad vibes from someone close to your friend is the worst' before moving to the 'tricky situation' acknowledgment"
