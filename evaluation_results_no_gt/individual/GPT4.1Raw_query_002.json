    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text message",
      "Uses first-person language naturally ('I can help you figure out what to do', 'I can help you get started') which creates personal connection",
      "Offers two specific, realistic options for handling the situation (explaining honestly vs. doing it quickly now)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks contractions that would make it feel more casual and text-like (uses 'you could' instead of 'you'd', 'you can' instead of 'you'd', 'I can' instead of 'I'd')",
      "Ends with an invitation/conditional statement rather than a direct question ('If you tell me...') which is less engaging than asking 'What subject is it?'",
      "Emotional validation, while present, is brief and could be more vivid ('Oh no' is good but could expand on that sinking feeling)"

      "notes": "Response is a single paragraph of pure prose with no formatting, headers, or lists. Ideal format for teen texting context."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add contractions to sound more natural and casual (e.g., 'I'd love to help' instead of 'I can help', 'you'd probably' instead of 'you could')",
      "Rephrase the ending as a direct question like 'What class is the homework for?' or 'Do you remember what the assignment was?' to better invite continuation",
      "Expand slightly on the emotional validation upfront to acknowledge that specific 'stomach drop' feeling of forgetting homework before jumping to solutions"
