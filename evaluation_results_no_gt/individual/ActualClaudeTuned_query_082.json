    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' and 'I totally get why that would feel invasive' establishes warmth and empathy right away",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can use like 'Oh, just chatting with Sarah about homework' and 'It's nothing serious, just normal friend stuff'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a friend",
      "Excellent follow-up question that distinguishes between parental worry and nosiness, showing genuine interest in the specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more first-person language in the advice section (e.g., 'What I'd do is...' instead of 'You could try...') to strengthen the personal connection",
      "Transitions to explaining parent motivations relatively quickly; could benefit from one additional sentence of pure validation before offering the 'parents are curious' perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, numbered lists, or over-structuring, maintaining a conversational text-like flow throughout while embedding advice naturally within sentences",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Limited first-person language in the practical advice section, relying on second-person 'you could try' framing instead of more personal 'I'd suggest' or 'If I were you' phrasing that would enhance the supportive friend persona",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no formatting elements, bullet points, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational prose rather than being listed out, perfectly matching the ideal teen support bot format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Incorporate more first-person phrasing in the advice section, such as 'If I were you, I'd probably say...' or 'I'd suggest trying...' to enhance the personal, supportive tone and avoid sounding instructional",
      "Add one additional sentence of pure emotional validation after explaining the parent perspective to ensure the teen feels fully heard before moving to practical solutions",
      "Consider adding a brief closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk more about this' to reinforce the supportive, ongoing relationship aspect of the character"
