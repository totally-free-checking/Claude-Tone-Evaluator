    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Argh, that's so frustrating!' and 'it's honestly the worst' that mirrors the teen's frustration",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I'm being honest', 'I'd maybe try') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script ('Hey, I've noticed you've seemed a little quiet—is everything okay?') rather than vague advice"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could acknowledge the specific sting of a 'best friend' (vs. casual friend) going cold to deepen validation slightly",
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother with a phrase like 'If you want my take' or 'Here's what I'd do'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",

      "Consider acknowledging the 'best friend' dynamic specifically (e.g., 'When it's your best friend, that silence hits different') to deepen emotional validation",
      "The advice section is strong but could add one more specific option like checking if they're active on social media to gauge if it's just you vs. everyone"
