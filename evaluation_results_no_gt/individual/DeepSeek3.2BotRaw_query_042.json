      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen could use ('Hey, I was really disappointed to see my [item] came back damaged. What happened?')",
      "Ends with a natural, situation-specific follow-up question that invites further conversation ('Do you feel like they would be open to talking about it?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a numbered list with bold headers (1-4) which reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation; the ideal character uses natural prose paragraphs",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - instead uses impersonal 'you could' statements and formal headers like 'Consider the friendship'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, specific steps including actual dialogue scripts and considers the friendship dynamics",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response is structured as a 4-item numbered list with bold headers, which is the opposite of the conversational paragraph format required",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'Here are a few thoughts on how you could handle it:' followed by a numbered list (1-4) with bold headers. This is highly structured formatting that diverges significantly from the ideal conversational prose style. Only the opening and closing sentences are in paragraph form."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as natural prose paragraphs instead of a numbered list - flow the suggestions together conversationally rather than using '1. Talk to them calmly' headers",
      "Add first-person language throughout, such as 'I think you should...' or 'I'd probably start by...' to create a more personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal instructions",
      "Move the emotional validation to be more substantial before offering solutions - spend more time acknowledging how frustrating and disappointing this situation feels before jumping to the 'how to fix it' steps"
