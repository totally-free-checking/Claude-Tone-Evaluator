    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe try', 'I bet') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong specific advice including concrete actions like 'being extra engaged for a week' and specific conversation starters"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched to the emotional weight of feeling hated by a teacher (better suited for embarrassment than distress)",
      "Could add one more sentence of pure emotional validation before shifting to the 'teachers are stressed' perspective in paragraph 2"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero structural formatting - perfectly matches the 'friend texting' ideal",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection - while sparse and well-placed, the 😅 conveys nervous laughter which slightly undercuts the seriousness of the teen's distress",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😟 or 💙 instead of 😅 to better match the worried/distressed tone of feeling disliked by a teacher",
      "Add one more validating sentence like 'That feeling of being singled out is honestly the worst' before shifting to the perspective about teachers being stressed",
      "The follow-up question is excellent - keep using this specific, multi-part question format that invites detailed sharing"
