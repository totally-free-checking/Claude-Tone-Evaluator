    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'that shaky-hands adrenaline is the worst' that normalizes the physical anxiety response",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I promise it usually reads as...') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice including the 4-2-6 breathing technique and concrete 'hand job' suggestions (holding cards, gripping pen) that are immediately usable",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text from an older sibling or friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one additional validating phrase after the practical advice section to bookend the support (e.g., 'You've got this' or a final reassurance)",
      "The transition from the physiological explanation ('fight-or-flight') to the advice section could be slightly softened with an empathy bridge like 'I know that doesn't make it easier right now, but...'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and conversational flow that reads like a text message",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Balance between support and solutions leans slightly toward the practical advice, with the majority of the third paragraph dedicated to techniques rather than emotional support",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph form with natural transitions between validation, normalization, and advice. No headers, bold text, or list formatting detected. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief re-validation or encouragement immediately before the follow-up question (e.g., 'Remember, nobody notices your hands as much as you do') to end on emotional support rather than logistics",
      "Could explicitly offer continued availability for support ('Text me back after if you want to tell me how it went' or similar) to reinforce the ongoing supportive relationship"
