    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation ('Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable spot to be in') and immediately legitimizes the 'weird vibe' feeling",
      "Provides excellent, specific actionable advice with concrete scripts ('How are you feeling about [relationship]?') and realistic categorization of red vs. yellow flags",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specifics of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and structured formatting ('**Safety vibes**', numbered lists 1-5) instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel like an advice column rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Uses clinical/impersonal phrasing like 'our brains pick up on micro-expressions' and 'What you can do right now:' instead of casual first-person sharing"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific phrases to use and the nuanced distinction between safety concerns and personality clashes is exactly what a teen needs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose vs bullets - the response is formatted like a wiki article or safety guide with headers, bullet categories, and numbered steps rather than a warm text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses bold headers (**Safety vibes**, **Just-not-vibing**), bullet lists for red/yellow flags, and a numbered 1-5 action list. Reads as highly structured content rather than conversational flow. Ends with markdown horizontal rule (---) which adds to over-formatted feel."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that naturally weave the advice together - instead of '1. Don't confront yet... 2. Be a safe landing place...' try 'I'd probably hold off on confronting him directly for now, and instead focus on being a safe landing place for her...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout like 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd say trust your gut...' to make it feel like a real person talking rather than an instruction manual",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to soften the clinical 'micro-expressions' language and reinforce the supportive tone"
