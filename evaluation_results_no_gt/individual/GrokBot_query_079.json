    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get why it feels so exposed', 'If I were you, I'd start small', 'I'm here if you want to brainstorm') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with flowing paragraphs",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that nervousness... is totally real' and physical empathy ('stomach's already twisting') before offering any advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition between the normalization paragraph ('tons of people get that way') and the advice paragraph could flow slightly more smoothly",
      "Could potentially include one more specific example of what 'owning the moment' looks like in practice, though the granola bar example is good"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person perspective - uses 'I'd', 'I think', and 'I'm here' naturally throughout rather than impersonal 'you should' statements",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The phrase 'messy human thing' while relatable, borders slightly on cliché, though it fits the casual tone",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out. Perfect formatting for teen support context."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using the 'If I were you, I'd...' construction as it feels like peer advice rather than authority figures dictating",
      "The specific examples (edge of cafeteria, granola bar) are excellent - maintain this level of concrete detail in future responses",
      "The follow-up question is perfectly specific to the situation rather than generic - keep asking targeted questions about their specific experience rather than broad 'how are you feeling' questions"
