    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd try', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic conversation script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I've noticed things have felt a little tighter lately—is there something going on...'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transitions quickly to explaining parent psychology ('parents go through phases') which slightly cuts short the emotional validation",
      "Could include one more validating phrase about the unfairness before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational flow—completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining readability",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward advice over validation—the explanation of why parents get strict comes perhaps a sentence too early before fully sitting with the teen's frustration",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as three natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, bold text, or structural formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure validation ('That really sucks when you feel like you're doing everything right') before explaining parent psychology",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific—maintain this level of contextual engagement in future responses"
