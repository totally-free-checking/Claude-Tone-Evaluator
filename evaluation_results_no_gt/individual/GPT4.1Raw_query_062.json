    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Tone is somewhat formal and clinical ('it's important to trust your instincts','Real friends should respect') rather than casual conversational language like 'I'd say trust your gut' or 'Ugh, that's such a tough spot'",
      "Follow-up question is closed-ended and generic ('Would you like that?') rather than open-ended and specific to their situation",
      "Lacks casual interjections and contractions that would make it feel more like texting with a supportive friend (says 'If you would like' instead of 'If you wanna')"

      "Change the closed yes/no question 'Would you like that?' to an open-ended question like 'What kind of thing are they pressuring you about?' or 'How are you feeling about confronting them?'",
      "Add one warm emoji early in the response (like 💙 or 😕) to enhance emotional warmth, or use more casual validating language like 'That's so relatable' or 'Ugh, that's the worst'"
