    "strengths": [
      "Immediate and strong emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'hit you right in the gut' that acknowledge the pain of being a backup friend",
      "Provides a specific, realistic conversation script the teen can actually use: 'I feel like I'm always the one reaching out...' which gives them concrete words for a difficult talk",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a self-help article"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice section - uses impersonal phrasing like 'maybe take a step back' and 'it's worth focusing on' instead of 'I'd suggest taking a step back' or 'I think you should focus on'",
      "Could include more explicit 'I'm here' language to reinforce the supportive relationship, such as 'I'm here if you need to talk through what happens when you pull back'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural elements, maintaining conversational flow throughout",

      "Add a brief 'I'm here' or 'I've got your back' statement to reinforce the supportive relationship before the follow-up question"
