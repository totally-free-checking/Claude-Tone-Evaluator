      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'That's such a frustrating situation! It totally makes sense that you'd be stressed about this'",
      "Specific, actionable advice that is realistic for a teen's agency, such as suggesting they 'walk them through your thought process' and 'show any notes, rough work'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers ('Talk to your teacher directly:', 'Gather evidence:', 'Know your options:') instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making the advice feel impersonal and instructional rather than like a supportive friend",

      "notes": "Response uses three major header sections ('Talk to your teacher directly', 'Gather evidence', 'Know your options') with 8 total bullet points, making it read like a wikiHow article or school handbook rather than a text conversation. The advice is delivered in list format rather than woven into natural sentences."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as natural prose paragraphs instead of bullet lists - for example, 'I'd probably start by asking your teacher for a private conversation where you can walk through your thought process. You could bring any rough drafts or notes to show your work...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'If I were in your shoes, I'd say...' to create a more personal connection",
      "Choose one follow-up question instead of two, or combine them into a single more natural question like 'What kind of assignment was it, and do you have any rough work saved that could help show your process?'"
