    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language that creates genuine connection ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I'm really sorry you're going through that')",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use with their parent ('I felt really exposed when you read my diary...') and concrete privacy solutions (locks, passwords)",
      "Natural conversational flow with appropriate contractions and casual phrasing ('honestly super uncomfortable', 'gut-wrenching moment')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Contains dismissive minimizing language that invalidates the teen's current feelings: 'it feels way worse than it actually is in the long run' suggests they're overreacting",
      "Uses 😅 emoji which is inappropriate for the serious emotional weight of feeling violated; it frames a privacy violation as an awkward 'oops' moment rather than a serious breach of trust"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and excellent first-person conversational voice that sounds like a supportive older sibling texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The minimizing/dismissive line suggesting the teen's feelings are exaggerated or temporary, which undermines the validation of their sense of violation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove the dismissive phrase 'it feels way worse than it actually is in the long run' as it minimizes the teen's valid feelings of violation; instead validate that the feeling of violation is real and understandable",
      "Replace the 😅 emoji with either no emoji or something more supportive like 💙 or 😔, since a nervous-laugh emoji is mismatched with the serious emotional weight of privacy violation",
      "Consider adding slightly more validation about the specific feeling of violation before moving to the 'most kids have dealt with this' normalization"
