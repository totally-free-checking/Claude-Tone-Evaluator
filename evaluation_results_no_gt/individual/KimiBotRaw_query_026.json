    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using 'Ugh, that pre-conversation dread is the worst' and the relatable metaphor about walking into a meeting without an agenda",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use like 'Okay, but can I have a sec to switch gears? I literally just walked in' and 'I'm struggling to see what you want me to do differently here'",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question about whether these talks are 'rare blowups or a regular weekly special' that invites continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers (**Buy yourself a minute**, **The 'attitude' translation game**, etc.) that function as bullet points rather than flowing prose, making it read like a self-help article instead of a text conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal 'you' advice format ('When he says attitude, he usually means...') instead of 'I think...' or 'I'd try...' which creates distance rather than connection",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😬) to match the 'ugh' sentiment in the opening"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific word-for-word phrases the teen can use in the conversation, making the advice immediately actionable and realistic",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - relies on bold headers and structured sections rather than natural paragraph flow, breaking the conversational texting format",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold headers (**Buy yourself a minute**, **The 'attitude' translation game**, **The reality check line**) that function as bullet points, with only the first paragraph and final sentence before the question written in natural prose. The formatting is too structured for a casual conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as flowing prose using first-person language: instead of '**Buy yourself a minute.** If you walk in hot...' try 'I'd start by buying yourself a minute. If you walk in hot, it'll escalate fast, so I'd try saying...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: change 'When he says attitude, he usually means...' to 'I think when he says attitude, he usually means...' and 'Asking Can you give me a specific example? sometimes shifts it...' to 'I'd ask for a specific example - something like...'",
      "Consider adding one emoji at the start (like 😅 or 😬) to enhance the warm, commiserating tone established by 'Ugh'"
