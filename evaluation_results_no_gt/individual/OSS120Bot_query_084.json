    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, getting grounded totally sucks' and 'I can hear that frustration' which makes the teen feel understood right away",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",
      "Specific, realistic advice tailored to the grounding situation (mini-projects, writing to parents) that acknowledges their limited agency while offering constructive action"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Limited first-person language in the advice section—uses 'you could' and 'maybe try' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you should', making the advice feel slightly less personal",
      "Minor redundancy in the follow-up question ('biggest thing you miss most' combines two phrases that mean the same thing)",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) early on to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though the absence isn't problematic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Lack of first-person perspective in the advice portion (uses second-person 'you could' rather than 'I think' or 'I'd try')",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format throughout. The advice section uses a colon followed by examples in commas, which flows naturally as prose rather than structured list"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Incorporate first-person language into the advice section (e.g., 'I'd suggest trying...' or 'I think writing a note...') to create stronger personal connection",
      "Fix the redundancy in the final question to either 'What's the biggest thing you miss?' or 'What do you miss most?'",
      "Consider adding one casual emoji at the start (like 😅 after 'sucks') to reinforce the warm, texting-a-friend vibe"
