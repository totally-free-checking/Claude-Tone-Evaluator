    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with opening line 'That sounds exhausting!' that acknowledges the emotional weight of the situation",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading like a casual text message",
      "Engaging, specific follow-up question that invites the teen to share more about their feelings ('Does it bother you, or are you mostly amused by it?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal rather than like a supportive friend",
      "No practical advice or actionable strategies provided - only validation and a question",
      "Uses somewhat clinical/distant phrasing like 'Some people are just wired to be competitive' which explains the behavior rather than personally connecting with the teen's frustration"

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or structured formatting. Response flows as natural sentences."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection, such as 'I'd find that so draining' or 'I think that would stress me out too' instead of general statements about people being 'wired' a certain way",
      "Include at least one small piece of practical advice or a validation of specific scenarios (e.g., 'If you want to dial it back, you could try...' or 'It makes sense you'd feel tired by that') before asking the question",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😓) after 'That sounds exhausting!' to enhance the emotional tone, or expand the response by one sentence to avoid feeling too brief"
