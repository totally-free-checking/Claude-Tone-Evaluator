    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message",
      "Opens with immediate first-person validation ('I'm really sorry you're feeling that way') and acknowledges the specific pain of one-sided friendships",
      "Offers the teen agency by asking whether they want advice or just listening, showing respect for their needs"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Too brief and somewhat dismissive - only 3 sentences for a painful emotional situation about friendship betrayal",
      "Provides zero concrete advice or observations about the situation, only asking if they want advice rather than offering any insight",
      "Follow-up question is transactional ('Do you want advice or listening?') rather than inviting them to share details about their specific situation",
      "Lacks casual teen-appropriate language - phrases like 'If you want, we can talk more' feel slightly clinical rather than warm and conversational"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting is perfect - natural paragraph flow with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The complete absence of practical advice or specific observations about friendship dynamics - it validates but offers no actual guidance or concrete next steps, leaving the teen without tools to handle the situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, lists, or headers. However, the brevity makes it feel somewhat abrupt despite the good validation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand the response to 2-3 paragraphs instead of 1 short one - add specific observations about how common this friendship dynamic is or share that many teens experience this",
      "Replace the transactional question ('Do you want advice or listening?') with an open-ended invitation to share details like 'When did you start noticing this pattern?' or 'What happened recently that made you feel this way?'",
      "Include at least one concrete piece of advice or reframing about friendships within the response rather than just offering to give advice later - for example, suggesting they notice which friends reach out just to check in vs. only when they need things",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) after the validation to enhance the emotional connection, or use more casual language like 'Ugh, that's such a gutting feeling' instead of 'it can be tough'"
