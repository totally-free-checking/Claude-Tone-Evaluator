    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's such a tough spot to be in' and acknowledging the physical reaction of 'stomach twist'",
      "Strong use of first-person conditional advice ('If I were you, I'd probably...') that feels like a supportive friend sharing personal perspective",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I've noticed a few things about [person] that kinda worry me—can we chat about it?'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one gentle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) could have enhanced the warm tone at the start",
      "The follow-up question uses 'untrustworthy' which is slightly more formal/clinical compared to the casual 'bad vibes' used earlier in the response"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the start (like 😅 or 💙) to immediately signal friendliness, though the absence doesn't significantly hurt the response",
      "In the follow-up question, consider using more casual language like 'What specifically feels off about them?' instead of 'untrustworthy' to match the earlier casual tone of 'bad vibes'"
