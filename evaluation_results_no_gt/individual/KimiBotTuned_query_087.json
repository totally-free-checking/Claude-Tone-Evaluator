      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as conversational paragraphs",
      "Strong emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's such a weird, heavy spot to be in' acknowledging the complexity of caring about someone while feeling suffocated",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('Hey, I love you, but I've been feeling a little overwhelmed lately...') and concrete behavioral changes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person connection language - doesn't use 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I'm here if you need to talk' which makes it feel slightly less like a personal conversation and more like general advice",
      "Could include more explicit reassurance of support availability at the end rather than just the question"
