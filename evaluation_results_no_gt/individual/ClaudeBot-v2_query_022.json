      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such a gross spot to be in' and reassurance that they're not being 'too sensitive'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I get that') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts for confronting the friend including exact phrases and follow-up responses if dismissed"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question provides specific examples (looks/grades vs low blows) which, while showing understanding, might slightly narrow the conversation compared to a more open-ended question",
      "Could benefit from one additional explicit statement of support like 'I'm here if you need to talk' before the closing question to reinforce the supportive relationship"

      "Consider adding a brief first-person supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk' before the follow-up question to strengthen the personal connection",
      "While the categorical examples in the question show empathy, trying a more open version like 'What kinds of things are they joking about?' could give the teen more space to define their experience"
