    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that is honestly one of the most annoying things someone can say!' which captures the frustration perfectly",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('If I were in your shoes,' 'I'd probably need to vent,' 'you totally can do with me') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts like 'I can't just flip a switch and feel better—I need a second to cool off' that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions rather than one focused question, which slightly dilutes the engagement ('What happened right before they said that? Do you want to talk about what actually got you upset in the first place?')",
      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 😤 or 😅) early on to enhance warmth, though the absence is not problematic for this frustration topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format with zero bullet points and authentic first-person perspective ('If I were in your shoes') makes this feel like texting with a supportive friend rather than receiving automated advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The double question at the end, while both relevant, slightly breaks the ideal of one focused follow-up question to continue the conversation naturally",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. The response flows naturally through four conversational paragraphs with advice embedded organically within sentences rather than listed out"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consolidate the ending into one focused question rather than two separate ones—perhaps something like 'What was going on right before they said that?' to keep the conversation focused",
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji early in the response (like 😤 or 🙄) to visually signal emotional alignment with their frustration, though this is optional given the strong verbal validation already present"
