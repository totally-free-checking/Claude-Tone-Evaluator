      "Excellent use of first-person language in advice section ('I'd probably start with small things') which creates genuine connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such an intense feeling!' and normalization with 'Pretty much everyone has been right where you are'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with zero structural formatting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😊) to enhance warmth at the opening or closing, though the absence doesn't significantly detract",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout while seamlessly blending validation and advice",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (such as 😅 or 💙) at the beginning or end to visually signal the supportive tone, though this is optional",
      "Maintain the strong first-person approach seen in 'I'd probably start with...' throughout - this is exactly the right voice for connecting with teens"
