    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable language ('gut punch,' 'hang over your head') that acknowledges the specific anxiety of accidental rudeness",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice with exact scripting ('Hey, I'm really sorry about what I said earlier—I didn't mean it that way') that teens can literally copy and send",
      "Maintains pure conversational prose throughout with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more explicit first-person recommendation language like 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you should' rather than 'If you can, try' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "The closing question is slightly complex with two parts combined ('Do you think... or are you hoping...'), which could be simplified to a single flowing question for better conversational feel"

      "Replace 'If you can, try sending...' with first-person framing like 'I'd probably send...' or 'I think a quick text like...' to match the character's voice",
      "Simplify the closing question to one flowing inquiry like 'Do you think they'll be open to hearing you out?' rather than the compound 'or' structure"
