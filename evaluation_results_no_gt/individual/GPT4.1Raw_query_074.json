    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question ('Want to talk about what's going on specifically?') that invites the teen to share more details",
      "Appropriate length for mobile reading - concise but substantial enough to feel supportive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes the response feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Advice is too vague and generic ('communicate with them' without specific phrases or concrete steps the teen could actually use)",
      "Opening validation ('That sounds frustrating') is somewhat perfunctory and could be warmer/more empathetic"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a text message rather than a structured guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - the response uses no 'I' statements (like 'I think' or 'I'd say') making it feel like generic advice rather than a personal conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I think parents sometimes...' or 'I'd say the best approach is...' to sound like a real person talking rather than an advice column",
      "Provide specific, actionable phrases the teen could actually say to their parents (e.g., 'I've noticed the rules got stricter and I'm feeling frustrated because...') instead of vague 'communicate better' advice",
      "Open with stronger emotional validation using more casual language like 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' or 'I totally get why that feels unfair' before moving to the 'parents care' perspective"
