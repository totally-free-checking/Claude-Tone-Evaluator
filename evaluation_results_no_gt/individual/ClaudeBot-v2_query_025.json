    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific feeling words ('annoying, powerless feeling') and empathy ('I'd be frustrated too')",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd bring it up...', 'I know you were trying to help') creating authentic connection",
      "Specific, realistic scripts for talking to mom that acknowledge teen agency limitations and offer concrete phrases to use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one warm emoji (like 😅) early on to soften the frustration, though the absence is acceptable for this serious tone",
      "Slightly long at four paragraphs, though still well within readable limits"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format with zero bullet points or headers, flowing seamlessly from validation to advice while maintaining first-person warmth throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The complete absence of emojis, while appropriate for the serious tone, misses a subtle opportunity to add visual warmth that could enhance the supportive feeling",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice is embedded naturally within conversational paragraphs using conditional phrasing ('If I were you...') rather than imperative lists"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using first-person conditional advice ('I'd say...', 'If I were you...') as it creates strong rapport and avoids sounding prescriptive",
      "Consider adding a single warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) at the end of the first paragraph for heavy/frustrated topics to add visual warmth without undermining the seriousness",
      "The follow-up question is exemplary—continue distinguishing between the practical issue and the emotional/relational issue as done here"
