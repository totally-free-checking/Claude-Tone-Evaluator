    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Oh wow, that's such a heavy situation' and 'I totally get how lost and worried you must feel'",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say,' 'I totally get,' 'I care') creating genuine connection",
