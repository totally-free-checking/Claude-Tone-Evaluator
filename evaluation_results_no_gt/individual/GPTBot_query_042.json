      "The follow-up question is specific and engaging, asking about the specific items and damage to help draft a personalized response",
      "Provides concrete scripts/phrases the teen can actually use in the conversation (e.g., 'Hey, I'm upset because when you returned my stuff it was damaged...')",
      "Acknowledges the emotional aspect of broken trust immediately, not just the material damage"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-formatted with headers (### 1, ### 2), numbered lists, and bullet points instead of conversational prose",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive friend",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping into extensive practical advice (only one brief sentence of validation vs. six detailed sections of advice)",
      "Uses overly formal structures like blockquotes and headers that feel like a legal guide rather than a text conversation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end which naturally invites the teen to share more details so the conversation can continue",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The heavy use of markdown headers, numbered sections (1-6), and bullet points making it read like an instruction manual rather than a warm conversation",

      "notes": "Response uses markdown headers (###), six numbered sections with sub-bullets, and blockquote formatting. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are prose. Reads like a structured self-help guide rather than natural text messages."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural paragraphs without headers or numbered lists, flowing advice conversationally using transitions like 'First, I'd try to...' or 'Something that might work is...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout like 'I think you should...' or 'I'd probably feel the same way' to create personal connection instead of impersonal 'you should' directives",
      "Expand the emotional validation section significantly before offering solutions - spend more time sitting with their feelings about the betrayal of trust",
      "Remove overly formal structures like '### 1)' and legalistic suggestions (small claims court) or frame them more casually as 'If it's really expensive, you might consider...'"
