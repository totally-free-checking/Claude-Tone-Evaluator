    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation using teen-appropriate language ('Ugh, stress headaches are the worst') and immediate empathy ('I'm sorry you're dealing with that')",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (20-20-20 rule, 4-4-6 breathing technique, specific compress suggestions)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely over-structured with headers and bullet points (### Immediate relief, ### Longer-term stress management) rather than conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout advice sections - uses impersonal instructional tone ('there are a few things you can try,' 'Let's start with') instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think'",
      "Ends with generic service-oriented question ('Anything else I can help with?') rather than specific question about their stress situation",
      "Becomes clinical/educational ('H2O,' 'your brain's happy chemicals') rather than maintaining conversational friend-tone throughout"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific techniques (20-20-20 rule, breathing counts, temple massage) are concrete and immediately actionable for a teen",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting structure - uses heavy markdown headers and extensive bullet points like a medical wiki article rather than natural prose paragraphs suitable for texting",

      "bullet_count": 10,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses three header sections (###) with 5, 4, and 1 bullet points respectively. Only 2-3 sentences of actual prose at beginning and end. Reads like a structured health guide rather than a supportive conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs using first-person suggestions: 'I'd start by drinking some water - I know it sounds simple but stress dehydrates us...' instead of listing bullet points",
      "Replace the generic closing 'Anything else I can help with?' with a specific engaging question about their situation: 'What's been stressing you out the most lately?' or 'Is it school stuff or something else causing all this tension?'",
      "Remove headers (###) and bold text formatting entirely - write as continuous text like texting a friend",
      "Add one warm emoji early (like 😓 or 💙) to match the 'ugh' sentiment, and use more 'I' statements like 'I get how overwhelming that feels' throughout"
