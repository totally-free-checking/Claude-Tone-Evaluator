      "Provides a specific, actionable script the teen can use word-for-word ('I know you might think it's funny, but when you talk about fighting me...')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Ends with a definitive statement instead of a follow-up question to continue the conversation",
