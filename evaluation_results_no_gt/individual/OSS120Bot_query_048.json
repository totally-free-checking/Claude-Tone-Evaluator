    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get how painful it feels', 'If I were you, I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Zero bullet points or formatting - flows as natural conversational prose with advice embedded in sentences",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts like 'I love my sibling, but I also need my own space to shine' that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji paired with 'that really sucks' creates slight tonal ambiguity (😅 implies awkwardness/nervousness while the situation sounds painful/frustrating)",
      "The follow-up question combines two queries ('What's the last time...' and 'how did you react') which slightly complicates the engagement"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - advice flows organically within conversational paragraphs using first-person conditional language",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice (😅) is slightly mismatched with the emotional weight of 'sucks' and 'painful,' potentially minimizing the frustration when a more supportive or neutral emoji (or none) might fit better",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as continuous prose with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice is delivered naturally within paragraphs using transitions like 'If I were you, I'd try...' and 'You could also...'"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider whether 😅 is the right choice for expressing solidarity with pain - 😔, 😕, or simply no emoji might better match the 'sucks' sentiment, or keep 😅 if intending to highlight the awkwardness of the comparison dynamic",
      "The follow-up question could be simplified to a single focus (e.g., 'How did you react the last time it happened?') rather than asking for both the instance and the reaction in one go"
