      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and vivid empathy ('feels like someone went through your brain without permission')",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd tell them plainly,' 'I'd move anything private') creating a supportive peer-like connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 💙) to enhance warmth, though the serious topic makes zero emojis acceptable",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using first-person advice language ('I'd say,' 'I think') as it creates strong rapport and avoids sounding like a generic advice column",
      "The specific question about parent motivation ('worried about something' vs 'my house, my rules') is excellent - keep tailoring follow-up questions this specifically to the situation",
      "For lighter topics, consider adding one subtle emoji early in the response to set warmth, though omitting it for serious violations like this is appropriate"
