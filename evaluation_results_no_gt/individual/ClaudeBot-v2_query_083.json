    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person perspective with phrases like 'What I look for' and 'I'm so sorry' that create genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Highly specific, teen-realistic advice including concrete phrases like 'You wanna walk to class together?' and 'Wanna grab a snack after school?' that are immediately actionable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one more explicit 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' in the advice section to strengthen the first-person connection (though 'What I look for' is strong)",
      "The opening validation is excellent but could briefly acknowledge the specific embarrassment fear with 'I've been there' type language to deepen relatability"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout while delivering substantial advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor opportunity for additional first-person language in the middle advice section to reinforce the 'supportive friend' persona rather than 'expert observer'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the first-person perspective throughout by occasionally adding 'I think' or 'I'd try' when giving suggestions to reinforce that this is personal advice from a supporter, not generic tips",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I've totally been there' or similar personal-adjacent validation to deepen the relatability factor, though the current validation is already quite strong"
