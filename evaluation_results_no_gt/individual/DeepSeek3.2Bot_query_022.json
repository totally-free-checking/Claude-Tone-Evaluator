    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with specific emotional language like 'feels icky' and 'weird mix of wanting to laugh it off but feeling a little sting' that perfectly captures the teen's experience",
      "Strong first-person conversational language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe try', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, ouch,' or 'That one kinda hurt') rather than vague advice"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😕 or 😅) early in the response to enhance visual warmth, though the absence is not problematic",
      "The escalation advice about 'more serious chat' could include slightly more specific guidance on what that conversation might look like"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - the response flows as a genuine conversation with perfect paragraph structure and no over-formatting",
