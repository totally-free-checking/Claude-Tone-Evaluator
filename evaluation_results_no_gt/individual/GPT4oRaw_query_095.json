    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads as natural conversational paragraphs",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use: 'Hey, you keep joking about fighting me, but I don't find it funny anymore...'",
      "Good balance between emotional validation and practical solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses 'you could' and 'it's time' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest', making it feel impersonal",
      "Ends with a statement rather than a question, failing to continue the conversation",

      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - change 'You could say' to 'I'd try saying' and 'it's time to set boundaries' to 'I think it's time to set some boundaries'",
      "End with a specific, engaging question to continue the conversation such as 'How long has this been going on?' or 'Do you feel safe around them?'",
      "Consider adding one supportive emoji early in the response (like 😕 or 💙) to enhance warmth given the uncomfortable nature of the situation",
      "Deepen the emotional validation by using more personal, relatable language like 'Ugh, that's such a sinking feeling' or 'I get why that would make you anxious'"
