    "strengths": [
      "Opens with warm, immediate validation using casual language like 'Oof' and acknowledges the difficulty of navigating trust issues",
      "Provides specific, realistic conversation scripts such as 'Hey, I've been feeling a little confused about [the situation]...' that give the teen actual words to use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a heavily structured numbered list format (6 steps with bold headers) that reads like a self-help article rather than natural conversation",
      "Lacks first-person perspective throughout the advice section, using imperative commands like 'Reflect First' and 'Pick the Right Moment' instead of 'I think you should...' or 'I'd suggest...'",
      "Provides minimal emotional validation (only one brief sentence) before immediately jumping to a lengthy list of action items"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - it offers concrete, actionable steps and specific phrases the teen can actually use in a difficult conversation",

      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response contains 6 main numbered steps with bold headers and 4 sub-bullets with example phrases, making it read as a structured listicle rather than a flowing conversation. The advice is delivered as imperative commands rather than natural prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the numbered steps into 2-3 flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think you could start by taking a moment to reflect...' instead of imperative commands",
      "Add more emotional validation before offering advice - spend a paragraph acknowledging how uncomfortable and isolating it feels to suspect a friend of lying before moving to solutions",
      "Remove all bold text, numbered lists, and headers to create a seamless conversational flow that feels like texting with a supportive older sibling rather than reading a wikiHow article"
