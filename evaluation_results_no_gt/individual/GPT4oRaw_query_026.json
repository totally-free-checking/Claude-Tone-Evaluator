    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-formatting, reading like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Uses authentic first-person validation ('Ugh, I totally get that') and casual teen-appropriate language ('hit him with something like,' 'sounds cheesy')",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Okay, I'm open to hearing what you have to say'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Pivots to advice and reframing too quickly after validation—the 'But hey, maybe try not to look at this as a full-on attack' comes immediately after acknowledging their frustration, potentially minimizing their feelings",
      "Could use more first-person language in the advice section ('I'd suggest' or 'I think' instead of 'It might help' or general statements like 'Parents usually mean well')",
      "Lacks sustained emotional validation before moving to solutions; the balance leans more toward practical advice than emotional support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero structural formatting—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any bullet points, headers, or corporate formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Balance between emotional support and solutions—validates the annoyance for only one sentence before immediately challenging the teen's perspective ('maybe try not to look at this as a full-on attack') and moving to advice, which could feel dismissive of their valid frustration",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with three natural paragraphs. No bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one or two more sentences of pure emotional validation before the 'But hey' pivot—acknowledge how annoying it is when parents want to talk about 'attitude' specifically, and sit with that feeling longer before offering reframes",
      "Replace impersonal constructions like 'It might help' and 'Parents usually mean well' with first-person language like 'I'd suggest' or 'I know my parents usually mean well...' to maintain the conversational, personal connection throughout the entire response",
      "Consider adding a single warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a supportive tone, though the absence is also acceptable for this topic"
