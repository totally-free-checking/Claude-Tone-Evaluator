      "Provides excellent specific scripts the teen can use like 'I don't like that. Stop.' which gives them concrete words in a difficult moment",
      "Covers comprehensive practical ground including documentation, authority figures, and allies, showing real understanding of teen agency and resources"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' anywhere, making it feel like an impersonal guide rather than a supportive friend",
      "Opens with clinical analysis ('Teasing can feel confusing because...') instead of emotional validation like 'Ugh, that's such a hard spot to be in' or 'I'm sorry you're dealing with this'",
      "Uses heavy formatting with multiple headers (###), bullet lists, and numbered steps instead of natural conversational prose"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality is strong with specific, actionable phrases and realistic steps that respect teen limitations while empowering them",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is completely misaligned - it reads like a wiki article or school pamphlet with headers, bullet points, and numbered lists rather than a text conversation with a supportive friend",

      "notes": "Uses ### headers for sections, bullet lists for criteria, numbered lists for steps, and a final bulleted questionnaire. Reads like an informational guide rather than a conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural prose paragraphs - remove all ### headers, bullet points, and numbered lists. Advice should flow naturally within sentences like 'I'd probably start by telling them directly...'",
      "Add immediate emotional validation using first-person empathy like 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with this - that gray area between teasing and bullying feels awful' before any advice",
      "Replace the four-question survey at the end with one natural follow-up question like 'What kinds of things are they saying?' or 'Have you tried telling them it bothers you yet?'",
      "Use first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get why that's confusing') to create connection rather than sounding like a manual"
