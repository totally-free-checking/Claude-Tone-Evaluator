      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'I'm so sorry' and acknowledging 'that sinking regret after hitting post is the worst'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout including 'I'd say', 'I think', and 'I'm so sorry'",
      "Perfect prose format with natural conversational flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Natural emoji usage with one well-placed 😅 that enhances the warm, slightly awkward tone of the situation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The reassurance 'it feels way bigger in the moment than it probably is' comes quickly in paragraph 2 and could potentially feel minimizing before fully validating the intensity of the regret",
      "Practical advice could include slightly more specific scripting or examples of what to say when reaching out to friends for support"
