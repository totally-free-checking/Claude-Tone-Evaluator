    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that sounds exhausting') and uses relatable metaphors ('referee in a game nobody asked you to play')",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('Hey, I love you guys but the arguing stresses me out') and realistic teen strategies like the 'slow fade'",
      "Ends with a natural, situation-specific follow-up question about what they're arguing about"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses four bold headers ('**Is it possible to gray rock it?**', etc.) which creates a structured, article-like format rather than natural conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' - making it feel impersonal like an advice column rather than a friend texting",
      "Heavy imbalance toward practical advice (four structured sections) versus emotional validation (one brief paragraph)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, teen-realistic strategies with specific scripts and actions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - relies on bold headers and structured sections instead of flowing conversational paragraphs",

      "notes": "While technically written in paragraphs, uses four bold headers (**Is it possible...**, **Can you break off...**, etc.) that create a list-like structure. Reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove all bold headers and rewrite as flowing prose - instead of sections, use transitions like 'First, I'd try...' or 'Honestly, you could also...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: 'I think you should try...', 'I'd probably gray rock it...', 'I'm getting stressed just imagining that'",
      "Integrate emotional validation throughout rather than front-loading it - check in between advice points with phrases like 'I know that's easier said than done though'"
