      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd just say', 'I totally get it', 'That's totally something I do') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the apology rather than vague advice ('Hey, I've been thinking about what I said earlier...')",

      "Slightly lengthy middle paragraph could be tightened while maintaining the specific script example",

      "The specific apology script provided is exactly the kind of concrete help teens need - keep including these specific phrases"
