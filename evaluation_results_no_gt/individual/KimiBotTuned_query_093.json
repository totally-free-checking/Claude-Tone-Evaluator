      "Opens with immediate validation ('Ugh, that's such a real fear') that acknowledges the emotional weight of the situation",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts for the teen to use ('Yeah, I wanted to switch it up,' 'Thanks, I'm trying something new') which makes the advice immediately usable",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') throughout the response, relying heavily on second-person 'you' statements which creates slight distance",

      "Add first-person perspective statements like 'I think starting small really helps' or 'I'd say the comments usually fade fast' to create more personal connection",
