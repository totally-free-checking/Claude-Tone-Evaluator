    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, casual validation ('Ugh, that really sucks') and uses visceral emotional language ('gut punch') that teens relate to",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script for the conversation ('Hey, I noticed my ___ got damaged...') rather than vague advice to 'just talk to them'",
      "Maintains natural first-person voice throughout ('I totally get why you'd feel hurt', 'we'd like') creating genuine connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched for the severity of a ruined item (implies awkwardness/nervousness more than empathy for loss)",
      "Could strengthen first-person advisory language with phrases like 'I'd suggest' or 'I think' rather than the slightly impersonal 'maybe have a calm chat'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, flowing as a continuous conversational text message",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace 😅 with 😕 or 💙, or remove it entirely, as the nervous laughter emoji undermines the validation of genuine hurt feelings",
      "Add explicit first-person advisory phrases like 'I'd probably say something like...' or 'I think the best approach would be...' to strengthen the personal, friend-giving-advice tone",
      "Consider validating the specific loss of the item itself ('That item meant something to you') in addition to validating the feelings about the friend"
