    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that... feeling is so heavy') that mirrors the user's anxiety and makes them feel seen",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact scripting for talking to counselors ('I'm feeling behind and I don't know what to pick—can you look at my options with me?')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads like a natural text conversation from start to finish"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel slightly more like general advice than a personal conversation from a supportive friend",
      "Uses constructions like 'Honestly, a lot of people are guessing' and 'It usually feels' rather than 'I think most people are guessing' or 'I get how that feels'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and flow—completely avoids bullet points and structured lists while maintaining clarity through natural paragraph transitions",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to increase warmth and personal connection—try 'I totally get that feeling' or 'I'd suggest starting with...' instead of the more general 'It helps to...'",
      "Consider adding one 'I' statement early on like 'I've been there' or 'I remember that stress' to establish the conversational peer relationship more strongly"
