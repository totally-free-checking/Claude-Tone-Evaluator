    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses heavy formatting with bold headers (**The soft opener:**, **Give them an easy out:**, **Direct but kind:**) that reads like a self-help article rather than natural conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language (no \"I think,\" \"I'd say,\" or \"I get it\") making it feel instructional rather than personal",
      "Ends with two questions at once (\"What's your gut telling you...\" and \"How do you think your friend...\") which feels overwhelming rather than naturally conversational"

      "Choose one follow-up question instead of two - either ask about their gut feeling OR how the friend handles direct questions, not both",
      "Remove the transitional phrase 'A few gentle approaches you could try:' which signals a formal list structure"
