    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, relatable validation ('Ugh, that shaky-hands panic is the worst') that captures the physical sensation perfectly",
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs like 'Right before you go up, try a slower breath...'",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice including the 4-6 breathing technique, gripping the podium, and the realistic timeline of 30-60 seconds for body to calm"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel slightly impersonal despite being warm - uses second person ('your body', 'you're') throughout without the 'I've been there' connection",
      "Could benefit from an explicit 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar supportive closing to reinforce the supportive relationship"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective and shared experience language ('I get nervous too', 'I always find that...') makes it feel slightly detached despite the warm tone",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect paragraph structure with three natural prose blocks flowing from validation to reassurance to practical advice, with no headers, bold text, or list formatting"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person sharing like 'I get that shaky-hands feeling too' or 'I'd definitely try to hold something solid' to create more personal connection",
      "Include a brief supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk after' or 'You've got this' to reinforce the supportive bot character"
