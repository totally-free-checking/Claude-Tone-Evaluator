      "Provides excellent specific text templates the teen can literally copy and paste to coach and friends",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-formatted with numbered headers, bold text, and bullet points instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Minimal emotional validation - only 'Ah, that's annoying' before jumping straight into 3-step instructional list",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout the advice section (no 'I think', 'I'd suggest', or 'I get it') making it feel impersonal"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural prose paragraphs instead of using numbered lists and bullet points - advice should flow conversationally like 'I'd probably start by checking if practice is flexible...'",
      "Add more emotional validation upfront before giving solutions - acknowledge how stressful it feels to double-book and that forgetting happens to everyone",
      "Incorporate first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' throughout the advice to create personal connection rather than sounding like a generic guide"
