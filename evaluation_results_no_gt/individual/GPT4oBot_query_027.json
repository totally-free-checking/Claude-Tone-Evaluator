    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I totally get that', 'I'm happy to help', 'I promise') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate validation using relatable language ('Ugh', 'nothing's worse', 'brain just freezes') before offering any advice"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition to advice ('Would it help to break things...') could include one more validating sentence to further emphasize the emotional support before problem-solving",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains perfect paragraph flow throughout",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase like 'That paralysis is so real' before transitioning to the 'Would it help' advice section to strengthen the support-to-solutions balance",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific - continue using this approach of asking concrete questions about their specific situation rather than generic 'How are you feeling' questions"
