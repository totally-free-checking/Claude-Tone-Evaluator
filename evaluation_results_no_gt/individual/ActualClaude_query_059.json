    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate validation with phrases like 'That sounds really frustrating!' and 'I totally get why that would wear on you' that acknowledge the emotional toll",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice about pausing initiation to test relationship reciprocity, which is realistic and immediately doable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person framing when offering advice (e.g., 'I think that can be pretty telling' vs. the more impersonal 'Sometimes that can be pretty telling')",
      "Contains two questions spread through the response rather than one focused follow-up at the end, which slightly dilutes the conversational flow",
      "Could deepen validation by specifically naming the loneliness or rejection fears that often accompany this dynamic before jumping to the 'different communication styles' explanation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting is exemplary - it uses natural paragraphs with no bullet points, bold text, or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The conversational tone, while casual, misses opportunities to use first-person perspective markers ('I'd say', 'I think', 'In my experience') when transitioning to advice, making the suggestions feel slightly more like general observations than personal support",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. Advice is woven into sentences rather than listed, with no formatting crutches used."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to the advice section, such as 'I'd suggest trying an experiment where...' or 'I think it might be revealing to...' to make it feel more like personal support",
      "Consider either consolidating to one focused follow-up question at the very end, or ensuring the final question feels like the clear conversation continuer rather than having questions in both the middle and end",
      "Deepen the initial validation by adding one sentence acknowledging the specific fear of 'what if nobody cares enough to text me first?' before moving to the communication styles explanation"
