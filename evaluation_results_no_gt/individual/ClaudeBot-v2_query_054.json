      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry you're dealing with that' and vivid description of the 'gross, stuck-in-your-head kind of feeling' that perfectly captures the emotional experience",
      "Natural first-person advice giving throughout ('I'd try one clear boundary,' 'I'd start looping in an adult') that makes the advice feel personal and supportive rather than prescriptive",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly formal vocabulary choices in the advice section ('prioritize,' 'escalate,' 'looping in') that momentarily break the casual teen-conversation flow",
      "Could strengthen the first-person connection even more with an explicit 'I get it' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' to match the ideal character's specific first-person language examples"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The immediate emotional validation that names the specific feeling ('gross, stuck-in-your-head') and explicitly rejects self-doubt ('you're not being too sensitive') before offering any solutions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight shift toward more formal vocabulary ('prioritize getting away,' 'if you feel unsafe') in the third paragraph compared to the very casual opening",

    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider softening formal words like 'prioritize' and 'escalate' to more casual alternatives ('focus on,' 'gets worse') to maintain the conversational friend-tone throughout",
      "Add an explicit first-person supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or 'I get how heavy this feels' to match the ideal character's use of 'I get it' and strengthen the personal connection"
