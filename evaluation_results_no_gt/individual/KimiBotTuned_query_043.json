      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such a gross feeling' and acknowledging the 'brain spiral' that comes with suspicion",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word scripts the teen can use ('Hey, can I ask you about something? I've been feeling kind of confused...') rather than vague advice",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person 'I' statements (e.g., 'I'd suggest,' 'I think,' 'I get it') which would make it feel more personally connected rather than using constructions like 'it usually goes better'",
