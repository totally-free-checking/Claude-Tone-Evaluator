      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable spot to be in' that captures the awkwardness perfectly",
      "Specific, realistic scripts for what to say including boundary-setting language like 'I'm not gonna stop being friends with people just to prove something'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person bot perspective - uses impersonal constructions like 'it can help to say' instead of 'I think you could say' or 'I'd suggest'",
      "Missing explicit 'I'm here for you' or 'I get it' type statements that show the bot's personal engagement with the teen's situation"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column, with advice embedded naturally within paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language from the bot's perspective (no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I'm here if you need to talk') makes it feel slightly less personally connected despite the warm tone",

      "Add first-person engagement phrases like 'I think the best approach...' or 'I'd say...' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider adding one explicit validation statement like 'You're not alone in this' or 'We've all been there' to reinforce that this is a common experience"
