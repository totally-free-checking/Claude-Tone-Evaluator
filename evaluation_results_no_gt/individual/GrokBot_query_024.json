      "Opens with immediate, strong validation using 'Oof, that hurts' and 'total gut punch' to acknowledge the emotional impact",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout ('I've been there', 'If I were you, I'd try') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use ('Hey, I heard you guys had fun the other night – wish I'd been there!')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji feels slightly mismatched immediately following 'gut punch' – the emoji conveys nervousness/awkwardness while the phrase conveys deep hurt",
      "Could add slightly more validation before moving to reassurance that 'it happens' to fully sit with the hurt feelings"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points, headers, or over-formatting – reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice and placement – using 😅 (nervous/awkward) right after describing a painful 'gut punch' creates a slight tonal disconnect",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 💙 or 😔 instead of 😅 for exclusion situations, or omit the emoji entirely, as 😅 signals awkwardness rather than the hurt/pain of being left out",
      "Add one more sentence of validation like 'That sinking feeling when you see the photos is the worst' before moving to 'it happens' to fully acknowledge the pain"
