      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that sounds really draining!' and acknowledging the exhaustion of constant arguing",
      "Uses casual, teen-appropriate language like 'Are we talking like...' and 'Either way' that feels authentic"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective throughout - uses impersonal phrases like 'There are definitely some ways to handle it' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could try'",
      "Asks three questions at once (type of conflict, timing, and what's overwhelming), which can feel overwhelming rather than conversational",

      "Replace impersonal statements like 'There are definitely some ways to handle it' with first-person suggestions like 'I'd probably start by figuring out...' or 'I think you could try...' to create stronger connection",
      "Limit to 1-2 questions maximum per response - instead of asking about conflict type, timing, and feelings all at once, pick the most important one or combine them into a single flowing question",
      "While gathering context is good, offer one concrete micro-suggestion (like 'Maybe try headphones when they start up') to show you're actively problem-solving, not just deferring advice"
