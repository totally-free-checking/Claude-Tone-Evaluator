      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and vividly describes the 'replay it in your head' feeling, showing deep empathy for the frustration of unfair punishment",
      "Provides specific, actionable dialogue script ('I'm not trying to argue, I just want to understand...') that gives the teen exact words to use when approaching the teacher"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include slightly more varied first-person language (e.g., 'I think', 'I'd feel the same way', 'I get it') to strengthen the personal connection beyond 'I'm sorry' and 'If I were you'",
      "Absence of emoji is appropriate for the topic but could potentially include one warm emoji (like 😤) to match the frustration mentioned"

      "Consider incorporating one carefully chosen emoji (like 😤 or 💙) early in the response to visually reinforce the empathetic tone, though the current text-only approach works for this serious topic",
      "Add more first-person perspective phrases such as 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd be so mad too' to further personalize the voice and strengthen the 'supportive friend' character"
