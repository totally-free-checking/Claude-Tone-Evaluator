      "Strong emotional validation bookending the response with phrases like 'you're definitely not alone' and 'You deserve friendships that make you feel valued'",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses 'you might want to' instead of 'I think you could' or 'I'd try'",

      "notes": "Response is structured as intro paragraph, 5 bullet points with bold headers, and outro paragraph. The bullet points contain the majority of the advice content, making it feel like a listicle rather than a natural text conversation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 1-2 flowing prose paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think you could start by...' or 'I'd probably try...'",
      "Add a specific follow-up question at the end such as 'Is this happening with one specific friend or your whole group?' instead of the general 'I'm here' statement",
      "Incorporate natural first-person reactions like 'I get how that would feel really lonely' to make it sound more like a supportive friend texting"
