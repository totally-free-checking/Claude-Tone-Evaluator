      "Strong immediate emotional validation with vivid, relatable language like 'gut-kneading moments' and 'uncertainty totally sucks' that acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, reading like a supportive friend texting",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact scripting for confronting the person ('Hey, I'm not sure if you're joking...') and realistic next steps like talking to a counselor",
      "Natural conversational tone using contractions, casual phrases like 'super confusing' and 'gray-area spot,' and first-person validation ('I'm really sorry')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses impersonal 'You could...' framing rather than first-person 'I think...' or 'I'd suggest...' which would strengthen the personal connection",
      "Lacks emoji usage which could enhance warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the serious topic and the text conveys warmth effectively"

      "notes": "Excellent use of four natural paragraphs with no formatting structures. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining conversational rhythm throughout."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding first-person framing to the advice section, such as 'I'd suggest trying to note...' or 'I think you could bring it up...' to match the warm first-person validation in the opening",
      "While zero emojis is appropriate for this serious topic, consider ending with a single warm emoji like 💙 or a supportive phrase like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to reinforce ongoing support"
