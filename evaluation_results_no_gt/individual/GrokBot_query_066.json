      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you', 'I've had nights') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with relatable metaphors ('thoughts throwing a party you didn't invite')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is technically two questions combined, which slightly dilutes the focus",
      "Could acknowledge the 'for no reason' aspect more explicitly to validate that anxiety doesn't always need a trigger"

      "Consider acknowledging their mention of 'no reason' specifically to normalize that anxiety often doesn't need a trigger",
      "The double question at the end works but could be streamlined to one focused question like 'What's usually helped you when this happens before?'"
