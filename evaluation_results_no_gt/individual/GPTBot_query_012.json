    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation ('That hurts, and it makes total sense you'd feel...') that immediately normalizes the teen's embarrassment",
      "Ends with an excellent specific follow-up question asking about the context (school/work/party) and details of what they saw, showing genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
      "Provides concrete, realistic advice including an exact script ('Hey, do you want to grab coffee sometime?') that's appropriate for teen agency"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and numbered lists (6 total bullet points) with bold formatting (**Name the feeling**, **Reality-check**) that reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it,' or 'I'm here' which makes it feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Uses clinical/therapeutic language like 'your brain just did a very normal thing' and 'Name the feeling' which feels more like a psychology worksheet than casual peer support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end is exemplary - it's specific to the situation, asks for details about where it happened and what they observed, and naturally invites the teen to continue sharing",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is excessively structured with bullet points, numbered lists, and bold text throughout, completely breaking the conversational flow that should read like natural prose paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response contains a 3-item bullet list ('They could just be friends...') and a 3-step numbered list with bold headers ('1) Name the feeling...'). Heavy use of bold formatting (**text**) creates a structured, instructional feel rather than conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert all bullet points and numbered lists into flowing prose paragraphs - instead of listing '1) Name the feeling 2) Reality-check...', write it as a natural sentence like 'I'd start by just naming what you're feeling, then maybe reality-check that story you're telling yourself...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - use phrases like 'I totally get that sinking feeling,' 'I'd probably feel the same way,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk through it' to sound like a real person rather than an advice column",
      "Remove the bold formatting and clinical framing ('your brain did a normal thing') and replace with casual validation like 'Ugh, that's such a gut-punch feeling' to maintain the warm, friend-like tone throughout"
