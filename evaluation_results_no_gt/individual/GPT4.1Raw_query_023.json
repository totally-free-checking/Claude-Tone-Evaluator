      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",

      "Opening validation ('I'm sorry you're feeling that way') is slightly generic and could be more immediate/relatable ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling')",

      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to set a warm, casual tone for this socially awkward situation"
