      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Oh no, that sounds really frustrating!' and 'It's totally understandable to feel annoyed'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - uses 'our perspective' instead of personal connection, making it feel slightly detached despite casual tone",

      "Rearrange the ending so the question comes last rather than ending on the statement about parents - move 'Sometimes parents do this...' before the questions or remove it to end with the engagement question"
