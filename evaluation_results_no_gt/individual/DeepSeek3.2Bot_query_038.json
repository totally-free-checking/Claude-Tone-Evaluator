    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person conditional language for advice: 'If I were you, I'd start by grabbing a piece of paper...' makes it feel like personal guidance rather than generic instructions",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'I totally get that feeling' and acknowledging the specific anxiety that 'everyone else has it all figured out already'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs like 'Then, maybe chat with a teacher or older student...'",
      "Strong specific follow-up question that directly relates to the class-choosing scenario: 'What’s one subject you’re most excited about, or one you’re trying to avoid?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could more directly address the specific 'behind' anxiety (whether they mean behind on credits or just decision-making) with targeted reassurance",
      "Practical advice, while good, misses mentioning school counselors who are specifically there to help with this exact situation",
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for nervous energy, might slightly mismatch the weight of feeling 'so behind' - a warmer emoji like 💙 might better convey support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and first-person language usage - it reads exactly like a supportive older sibling texting advice, with no bullet points and excellent use of 'I think,' 'I'd say,' and 'If I were you' constructions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Could provide slightly more comprehensive practical resources (like mentioning guidance counselors or specific questions to ask teachers) to fully address the practical needs of someone feeling behind",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or bullet lists. The advice to 'make two lists' is presented conversationally within the prose rather than as formatted lists in the response itself."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a specific mention of talking to a guidance counselor or academic advisor, since the user specifically mentioned feeling 'behind' and might need help catching up on requirements",
      "Validate the 'behind' feeling more specifically - distinguish between being behind on credits vs. just feeling late to the decision-making process, as the advice differs slightly",
      "The response is excellent overall; maintain this level of first-person language and prose formatting in future responses"
