    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable teen language ('gut punch', 'stomach do flips') that acknowledges the spiraling feeling",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs",
      "Strong follow-up question using casual teen-appropriate language ('What's your vibe') that invites continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The advice section is slightly longer than the validation section, creating a minor imbalance toward solutions over emotional support",
      "The suggestion to 'focus on things that make you feel good' is somewhat vague compared to the specific texting advice provided"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with embedded first-person advice - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured self-help guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward practical advice over emotional validation - could use one more sentence of validation before transitioning to the 'If I were you' advice section",

    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of validation after 'Honestly, most of us have been there' to extend the emotional support before transitioning to advice",
      "The self-care suggestion could be more specific (e.g., 'hang with friends' or 'watch your comfort show') to match the concrete texting advice provided"
