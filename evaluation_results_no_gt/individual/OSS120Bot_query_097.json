      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd probably,' 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother - 'The good news is' feels a bit abrupt after the empathetic opening",
