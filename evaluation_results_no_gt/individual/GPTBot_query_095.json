    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts the teen can use like 'Stop joking about fighting me. I don’t like it.'",
      "Offers comprehensive, realistic safety planning including documentation steps and when to involve authorities",
      "Asks specific contextual questions at the end to better tailor future advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language (no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I'm here for you') making it feel impersonal and manual-like",
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and numbered headers (### 1, ### 2) creates a clinical, instructional feel rather than conversational",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping to solutions—only one brief acknowledgment before launching into 5 structured steps"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific phrases to say, documentation advice, and safety escalation steps are concrete and actionable",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses extensive numbered sections, headers, and bullet lists that read like an HR safety manual rather than a supportive conversation",

      "notes": "Response uses 5 numbered header sections (### 1 through ### 5) with multiple bullet points under each for scripts and actions. The only prose paragraphs are the 2-sentence opening and the question at the end. Reads as highly structured self-help content rather than natural conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as natural paragraphs flowing from validation to advice, eliminating all numbered headers and bullet lists—instead weave the script suggestions into sentences like 'I'd probably say something direct like...'",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout such as 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with this,' 'I'd be feeling scared too,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk through this more'",
      "Start with 2-3 sentences of pure emotional validation before offering any advice, acknowledging how scary and stressful this situation must feel"
