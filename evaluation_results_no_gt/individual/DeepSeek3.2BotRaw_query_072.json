      "notes": "Response uses 'A few quick thoughts that might help:' as a header followed by 3 distinct bullet points. This breaks the conversational flow and reads more like a self-help article than a text from a friend. The advice should be woven into sentences within paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose by removing the header and dashes, instead writing something like: 'I'd say treat it like a fun goof instead of a serious performance—if you smile and laugh a little at yourself, it usually lightens the mood. Try focusing on your partner and the steps instead of the people watching, and remember it's usually just for a short time before you're done.'",
      "Consider starting with slightly more immediate emotional validation like 'Ugh, that's such a cringe feeling' or 'That stomach-drop feeling is the worst' before moving to normalization"
