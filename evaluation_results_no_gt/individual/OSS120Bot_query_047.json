      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with physical description ('make your chest feel so tight') that shows deep empathy",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a natural text conversation",
      "Specific, realistic advice tailored to teen agency (suggesting text check-ins, trial run at movie night, shorter curfew compromises)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section could use more first-person language ('I'd suggest' or 'I think') instead of 'you could' to strengthen personal connection",
      "Second paragraph is slightly disconnected from the emotional arc - transitions abruptly from validation to 'it usually feels way worse than it ends up being' without bridging the emotional gap"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and structured lists while maintaining readability",

      "Add first-person framing to advice section (e.g., 'I'd suggest having a calm chat' instead of 'maybe try having a calm chat') to strengthen the supportive friend persona",
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) after the first sentence to enhance warmth, though the absence is not problematic for this serious topic"
