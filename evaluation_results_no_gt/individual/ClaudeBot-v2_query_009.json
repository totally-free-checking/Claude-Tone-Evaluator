    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with specific physical/emotional descriptors ('icky, stomach-drop feeling', 'feel watched')",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I get that you're trying') creating authentic connection",
      "Highly specific, actionable conversation scripts that teens can actually use word-for-word"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly advice-heavy compared to validation section (though still well-balanced)",
      "Absence of emoji is appropriate for the serious topic but could potentially enhance warmth with a single supportive one like 💙"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses natural casual phrasing ('Ugh', 'icky', 'chill adult') and consistently employs 'I' statements that make it feel like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward practical advice over emotional validation - the advice paragraph is longer than the validation paragraphs, though it does start with strong validation",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points or lists. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using phrases like 'You can say something like...' rather than breaking into formatted steps"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to enhance warmth, though the absence is acceptable for this serious topic",
      "The validation section could be slightly expanded with one more sentence acknowledging the violation of privacy/trust before moving to explanations, though the current opening is strong"
