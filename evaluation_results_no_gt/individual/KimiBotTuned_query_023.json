    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with physical specificity ('chest feel tight and your brain start spiraling') that makes the teen feel truly seen",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullets - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs with phrases like 'casually alone' and 'clocking your table'",
      "Specific actionable scripts ('Hey, mind if I sit with you guys today?') and realistic options that acknowledge different comfort levels"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could use more explicit first-person framing for advice (e.g., 'I'd suggest' or 'I think') rather than jumping straight to 'you can'",
      "Lacks the explicit 'I'm here' or 'I get it' first-person reassurance that builds connection beyond the opening apology"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose flow without any bullet points or over-formatting - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') in the advice portion makes the suggestions feel slightly less like personal counsel and more like general tips",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or bold text. The response uses em-dashes and parentheses naturally within sentences to create flow rather than structure."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to advice sections (e.g., 'I'd probably pick a spot that's casually alone...' or 'I think it's totally okay to...') to strengthen the personal connection",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) after the opening validation to match the 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' energy, though the text alone is sufficiently warm"
