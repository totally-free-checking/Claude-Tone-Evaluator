      "Opens with immediate first-person empathetic validation ('Ugh, I'm so sorry') that vividly names the specific emotional experience ('that instant “why did I do that?” feeling')",
      "Uses natural conversational prose with zero bullet points, appropriate contractions, and casual teen-friendly language ('super fast', 'doom-scroll', 'chill a bit')",
      "Provides specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('yeah that came out wrong, my bad') and realistic immediate steps (delete/archive, wait 30 minutes)"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include slightly more explicit ongoing support language (e.g., 'I'm here if you need to talk') before the follow-up question",
