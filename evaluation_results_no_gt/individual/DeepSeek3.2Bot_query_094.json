    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I think','I'd try') creating personal connection and avoiding impersonal advice-giving",
      "Follow-up question is natural and specific ('What's been the biggest stressor for you lately—is it something specific, or more of a general pressure buildup?') showing genuine interest rather than generic engagement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opening validation, while present, could be slightly warmer and more immediate ('That sounds so rough' is good but could include more empathetic phrasing like 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with that')",
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance warmth for the opening (though absence is acceptable, a single 💙 or 😔 could add emotional resonance given the physical pain context)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining clear organization through paragraph breaks",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emotional validation depth - while it validates immediately, it transitions quickly to practical solutions and could linger slightly longer on the emotional acknowledgment before moving to 'I think the first step'",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the opening (like 💙 or 😔) to enhance emotional connection for physical discomfort scenarios",
      "Expand the validation section slightly before offering solutions - perhaps add one more sentence acknowledging how frustrating it must be to have headaches on top of everything else you're dealing with"
