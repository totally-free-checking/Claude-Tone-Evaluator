      "Opens with validating language ('That really sucks') acknowledging the unfairness of the situation",
      "Asks specific contextual questions at the end to better tailor future advice (school vs. work vs. legal)",
      "Provides concrete, specific action steps rather than vague platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely heavy use of bullet points, numbered lists, and headers (###, bold text) instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Uses impersonal, legalistic language ('Get the exact claim in writing,' 'Collect proof and witnesses,' 'badge logs') that feels more like adult legal advice than teen support",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it' to create personal connection",
      "Minimal emotional validation (only one sentence) before launching into 7-step instructional guide",
      "Overwhelming length and detail that feels like reading a legal guide rather than texting a supportive friend"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The response attempts to gather context with specific follow-up questions about where the incident occurred (school, work, family, legal) to provide more relevant guidance",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is almost entirely structured bullets, numbered lists, and headers rather than natural prose paragraphs, making it feel like a wikiHow article instead of a conversation",

      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "10%",
      "notes": "Response uses a header (### What to do right now), 7 numbered bullet points with bold subheaders, and additional bold text throughout. The only prose is the opening sentence and the final question section. This is extremely over-formatted for a teen support conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in conversational paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think the best first step is...' or 'I'd probably try to...' instead of imperative bullet points",
      "Reduce the legalistic tone - instead of 'Collect proof and witnesses' and 'badge logs,' use teen-appropriate language like 'Maybe text a friend who was with you so you have that saved,' or 'Jot down what you remember while it's fresh'",
      "Add more emotional validation upfront - expand on 'That really sucks' with 2-3 sentences acknowledging how frustrating and scary false accusations feel before giving any advice",
      "Remove all headers, bold text, and numbered lists. Flow the advice naturally: 'First, try to stay calm even though that's super hard. Then maybe ask them exactly what they think happened...'",
      "Shorten significantly - teens reading on phones will be overwhelmed by 7 detailed steps. Pick the 2-3 most important actions and describe them briefly in a warm, supportive way"
