    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I've been there myself', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, that really sucks' and vivid emotional acknowledgment ('that sinking feeling like the whole world's against you')",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact script wording ('Hey, I felt like I wasn't fully heard earlier...') and realistic escalation options"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice could be slightly more gradual - moves to solutions in paragraph 3 after only two paragraphs of support",
      "Could potentially validate the unfairness a bit longer before offering the 'teachers see things differently' perspective, which slightly minimizes the feeling"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow without any bullet points, lists, or over-formatting - maintains warm, text-message-like quality throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight shift to perspective-taking ('teachers sometimes seeing things differently') comes quickly after validation, potentially feeling like minimizing before fully sitting with the unfairness",

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no bullet points, bold text, headers, or numbered lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure validation before the 'teachers see things differently' line to ensure the teen feels fully heard",
      "The specific script provided for talking to the teacher is excellent - keep using concrete phrase suggestions like this",
      "The follow-up question 'What exactly went down' is perfectly casual and teen-appropriate - maintain this natural phrasing style"
