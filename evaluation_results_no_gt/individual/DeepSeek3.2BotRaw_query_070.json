      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads as natural paragraphs",
      "Ends with an open-ended question that invites the user to share more details about their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think', 'I'd feel', or 'I'm here' to create personal connection (uses detached 'here if you want' instead of 'I'm here')",
      "Weak emotional validation - 'pretty tricky' is underwhelming for friend conflict; missing stronger empathy like 'Ugh, that's rough' or 'That sinking feeling when friends get mad'",
      "No practical advice or actionable suggestions offered - only asks for more information without providing any initial validation strategies or perspective",
      "Therapy-speak tone with phrases like 'unpack it' and 'boundary that got crossed' feels more clinical than like a supportive friend"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or headers, maintaining a conversational paragraph structure throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Complete absence of first-person language and weak emotional validation - feels impersonal and detached rather than warmly empathetic like a supportive friend",

      "Add first-person language to create connection: change 'here if you want' to 'I'm here if you want to talk' and include phrases like 'I get why that feels weird' or 'I'd feel hurt too'",
      "Strengthen the opening validation: instead of 'pretty tricky', use warmer language like 'Ugh, that's such a rough feeling' or 'That pit-in-your-stomach feeling when a friend is mad at you is the worst'",
      "Offer one small piece of perspective or advice before asking the question - even just validating that it's okay to have other friends - so the response doesn't feel like it's withholding support until they share more"
