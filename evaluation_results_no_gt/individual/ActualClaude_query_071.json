    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Opens with strong validation ('I hear you,' 'totally understandable') that immediately acknowledges the emotional weight of academic fear",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging question about the particular class and where help is needed most, showing genuine interest"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal 'we' statements ('when we're in that worried headspace') instead of 'I' statements like 'I get that feeling' or 'I'd suggest'",
      "Advice is somewhat generic ('talking to your teacher, getting tutoring') without specific actionable steps a teen could take tomorrow",
      "Missing emoji or warmer casual language (like 'Ugh, that stress is the worst') that would enhance the supportive tone for this anxiety-inducing topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone lacks first-person perspective - feels slightly detached despite being warm, missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' statements that create personal connection",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace general 'we' statements with first-person language like 'I totally get that sinking feeling' or 'I'd suggest starting by...' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Make the practical advice more specific to failing classes - suggest concrete actions like 'Ask your teacher if there's extra credit' or 'Try studying with flashcards for 20 minutes tonight' rather than general 'adjusting your study approach'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) after the validation to match the casual texting style, or alternatively deepen the emotional validation with more casual language like 'That stomach-drop feeling is the worst'"
