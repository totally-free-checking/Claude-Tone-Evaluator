    "strengths": [
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can use like 'Hey, I really value our friendship, but I've been feeling like I need a little more space to recharge'",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question: 'Do you want help figuring out exactly what to say?'",
      "Uses first-person validation at the opening: 'Oh, I totally get how that can feel overwhelming!'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered bullet points with bold headers (4 items), which reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Loses first-person conversational tone in the advice section, switching to imperative instructions like 'Be Honest (but Kind):' and 'Set Clear Boundaries:'",
      "Could use more emotional validation about the specific feeling of being suffocated by a clingy friend before jumping to solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides realistic, specific phrases and scripts the teen can actually say to their friend in this difficult situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - uses 4 numbered bullet points with bold formatting instead of conversational paragraphs, creating an instructional rather than supportive tone",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'Here are a couple of ways...' followed by 4 numbered items with bold headers (e.g., '**Be Honest (but Kind):**'), which creates a formal, instructional tone. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are in natural prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the four bullet points into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs that flow conversationally, using phrases like 'I'd suggest trying...' or 'Maybe you could say something like...' instead of imperative headers",
      "Add more first-person language throughout the advice section ('I think you could...', 'I'd probably say...') rather than detached instructions",
      "Expand the emotional validation to acknowledge how draining or guilty it can feel to need space from a friend before offering the practical scripts"
