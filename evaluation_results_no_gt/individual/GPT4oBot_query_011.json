    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'I totally get how that would get on your nerves' that acknowledges the emotional weight of losing your own space",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think if it's starting to get to you', 'I think it'd be so cool') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic conversation scripts the teen can actually use, including the exact phrasing 'Hey, I've noticed you've been doing a lot of the same stuff I've been doing and it's kind of bugging me. Everything okay?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transitions quickly from validation to explaining the friend's perspective; could use one more sentence of pure emotional validation before the reframe",
      "The follow-up question, while good, could be slightly more open-ended to invite deeper sharing rather than just a binary new vs. ongoing behavior question"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and conversational flow that reads like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance in the middle section where it moves from validation to explaining the friend's motivations; could linger slightly longer on the user's feelings before contextualizing",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect paragraph structure with natural transitions between validation, context, advice, and engagement. No headers, bold text, or list formatting used."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase after explaining the friend's perspective to return focus to the user's feelings before moving to solutions",
      "The response is exemplary overall; maintain this level of first-person language and specific scripting in future responses"
