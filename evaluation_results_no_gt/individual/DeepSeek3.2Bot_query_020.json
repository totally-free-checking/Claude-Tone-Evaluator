      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I promise', 'If I were you, I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with physical empathy ('Your stomach just drops') and relatable language ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - zero bullets or over-structuring while maintaining readability",
      "Natural, specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the details ('Was it a particular message... or has the conversation just sort of faded out?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could include one specific script or phrase example for what to text later if they don't respond",
