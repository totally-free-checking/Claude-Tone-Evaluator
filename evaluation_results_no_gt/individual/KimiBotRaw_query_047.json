    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's the absolute worst feeling' and acknowledging the FOMO",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I know you're worried about [safety/time/whatever]—what would make you feel okay about me going?')",
      "Natural conversational language that avoids being cringe while still feeling relatable ('dig in their heels', 'unlock the door literally')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers and structured sections ('The conversation approach', 'The compromise', 'The reality check') which function as bullet points, breaking the natural prose flow",
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' - while it uses 'I know', it could feel more personal with more direct first-person perspective",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji to enhance the casual, friendly tone given the teen context"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The emotional validation and practical advice quality - it perfectly balances acknowledging the frustration while offering realistic, specific strategies for talking to parents",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting with bold headers and bullet-like structure - this reads more like a self-help article than a text conversation with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold headers acting as section dividers ('The conversation approach', 'The compromise', 'The reality check'), which creates a structured, list-like format rather than flowing natural prose. The advice is embedded in paragraphs under these headers, but the formatting breaks conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the three bold headers into flowing transitional sentences (e.g., instead of '**The conversation approach**', try 'Honestly, I'd start with a real conversation...')",
      "Add one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 😊) to match the casual, friendly tone",
      "Incorporate more explicit first-person phrases like 'I think' or 'I'd try' to make it feel more like personal advice from a friend rather than general guidance"
