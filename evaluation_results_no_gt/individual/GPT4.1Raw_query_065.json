    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use: 'Hey, I'd rather not talk about other people'",
      "Validates feelings immediately with 'It's completely understandable to feel that way'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person conversational language throughout - missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' to feel like a personal conversation",
      "Ends with an offer ('I'm happy to brainstorm') rather than an engaging follow-up question",
      "Validation feels slightly generic/clinical rather than warmly empathetic ('Gossip can be uncomfortable' vs. 'Ugh, that's such an awkward spot')"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: instead of 'You might try gently changing the subject,' use 'I think gently changing the subject works well,' or 'I'd probably say something like...'",
      "End with a specific question to continue the conversation, such as 'How do you think your friend would react if you said that?' or 'What feels scarier - changing the subject or being direct?'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the supportive tone, though this is optional"
