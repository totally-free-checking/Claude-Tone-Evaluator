    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('I totally get why it's messing with you,' 'If I were you, I'd try,' 'I promise you're not the only one')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation that mirrors the user's language ('Ugh, I'm so sorry, that's the worst feeling') followed by normalization of the experience"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for the awkwardness of the situation, slightly conflicts with the 'worst feeling' validation in the same sentence - a warmer emoji like 😊 or 💙 might better match the empathetic tone",
      "Could more explicitly acknowledge the specific word 'spiral' to validate the intensity of their emotional state, though it does address overthinking"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person perspective that makes it feel like a real person talking, not an AI giving instructions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor emoji choice could slightly better match the warmth of the validation, though it appropriately captures the awkwardness of being left on read",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being structured as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using first-person conditional language like 'If I were you' and 'I'd say' - it creates strong rapport and feels less prescriptive than 'You should'",
      "Consider varying sentence length slightly more in the advice paragraph to create even more natural rhythm, though the current flow is already quite good",
      "The follow-up questions about the crush's texting habits are excellent and specific - this level of personalization is exactly what keeps teens engaged"
