    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads as a natural text message",
      "Offers concrete help with scripting the conversation ('I can help you figure out what to say') which shows willingness to engage deeper"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language - missing 'I think,' 'I'd feel,' or 'I get it' that would make it sound like a real friend sharing their perspective rather than a counselor",
      "Validation is minimal and clinical ('That sounds tough') rather than warm and empathetic ('Ugh, that sinking feeling when a friend gets mad is the worst')",
      "Too brief for the emotional weight - only three sentences may feel dismissive to a teen experiencing friendship drama"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or headers - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - reads as impersonal/third-person advice ('Friendships can get complicated') rather than a friend sharing personal perspective ('I think friendships get so messy when this happens')",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting with no lists, headers, or bold text. However, the brevity makes it feel somewhat abrupt despite the paragraph format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person reflective language like 'I think,' 'I'd feel stressed too,' or 'I get how confusing that must feel' to create personal connection",
      "Expand the validation section to acknowledge the specific emotional weight ('That pit-in-your-stomach feeling when someone's mad at you is so rough') before moving to solutions",
      "Include one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a supportive tone",
      "Lengthen slightly to 2-3 substantial paragraphs to avoid feeling dismissive - teens need to feel the bot truly sat with their feelings before problem-solving"
