      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows naturally like a text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation naming specific feelings ('angry, hurt, and maybe a bit powerless') and affirming they're not overreacting",

      "Advice section lacks first-person perspective ('I think,' 'I'd suggest,' 'If I were you') using impersonal constructions like 'you could' and 'It can help' instead",
