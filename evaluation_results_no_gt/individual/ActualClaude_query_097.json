      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-formatting - reads like a text message",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses only 'you' and general statements, making it feel like generic advice rather than personal support",
      "Brief validation ('It's totally normal') quickly pivots to 'The good news is...' without fully sitting with the awkward feelings first"

      "Add first-person language to create connection: instead of 'A simple, direct approach usually works best,' try 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd probably say something like...'",
      "Spend more time validating the emotional awkwardness before moving to 'the good news' - maybe 'Ugh, that stomach-drop feeling when you have to let someone down is the worst'",
      "Consider using one warm emoji early (like 😅 or 😬) to set a casual, supportive tone",
      "Either combine the middle questions into one flowing question or save them for after the final advice paragraph to avoid the interrogation feel"
