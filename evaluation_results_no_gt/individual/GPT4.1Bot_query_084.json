    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, such as 'If I were you, I'd probably want to...' and 'I'm totally here if you want to vent,' creating genuine personal connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a natural text conversation with a supportive friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's honestly the worst feeling' and using teen-appropriate language like 'hits different' and 'jail time'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could acknowledge the specific feeling of injustice/unfairness more directly rather than just the general frustration of being grounded",
      "While having no emojis is acceptable, adding one warm emoji (like 😤 or 😅) at the opening could enhance the visual warmth for this emotionally charged topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow with consistent first-person perspective ('I'd probably want to,' 'I'm totally here') that makes it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling rather than receiving automated advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriate to have none for this topic, the response misses the opportunity to use a single well-placed emoji to enhance the warm, validating tone established in the opening",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses three flowing paragraphs with no formatting structures, bullet points, or headers. Advice is seamlessly woven into conversational sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one emoji at the start (like 😤 or 😅) to visually reinforce the empathetic 'Ugh' opening, though the text alone works well",
      "Could explicitly validate the 'unfairness' aspect mentioned in the user's query with something like 'It really sucks when the punishment doesn't feel like it fits what happened' before moving to general grounding advice"
