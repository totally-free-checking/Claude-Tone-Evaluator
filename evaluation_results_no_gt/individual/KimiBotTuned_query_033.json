    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text message",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' and acknowledging it's 'your people' not just a seat",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact script wording ('I'm having a hard time staying motivated...') and realistic timeline (wait a day, 30 seconds after class)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal 'it happens to a lot of people' and instructional 'you can' rather than sharing personal perspective or connection",
      "Could validate the anger more specifically before moving to perspective/reframing - jumps quickly to 'it isn't personal' after only one sentence of validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero bullet points - maintains paragraph structure throughout while embedding advice naturally within sentences",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person 'I' statements makes it feel slightly impersonal despite casual language - reads as knowledgeable advice rather than 'I've been there' peer support",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs using coordinating conjunctions and casual transitions."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective like 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd suggest waiting a day...' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider adding 'I get why you're mad' or 'I'd be upset too' to validate feelings before offering the 'it's not personal' perspective",
      "The 😅 emoji works but 💙 or 😕 might better match the 'mad' emotion described, though 😅 fits the 'embarrassing' aspect mentioned"
