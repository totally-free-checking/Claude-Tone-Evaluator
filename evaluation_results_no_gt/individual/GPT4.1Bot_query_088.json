    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, authentic validation ('Ugh, that's honestly the worst') that captures the emotional weight of the situation",
      "Uses natural first-person language effectively in validation sections ('I get why that would make you feel...', 'I want you to know...')",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to the teacher ('Hey, I noticed that comment earlier...') rather than vague advice",
      "Maintains perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, reading like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section shifts to second-person suggestions ('you could talk...') without first-person framing ('I'd suggest...' or 'I think you should...') that would strengthen the conversational bond",
      "Ends with multiple questions at once ('How are you feeling now? Did anyone else...') which slightly dilutes the engagement compared to a single focused question"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - immediately acknowledges the anger and helplessness with authentic, relatable language ('freeze up', 'flying under the radar') without being dismissive",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language in the advice section - shifts to impersonal 'you could' statements rather than maintaining the 'I think'/'I'd say' perspective used in the validation sections",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to the advice section (e.g., 'If I were you, I'd probably...' or 'I think talking to the teacher privately could work...') to maintain the conversational 'friend giving advice' tone throughout",
      "Consider consolidating the final questions into one natural follow-up (e.g., 'How are you feeling about it now, and did anyone else in class seem bothered by it?') to avoid the 'interrogation' feel of multiple question marks"
