    "strengths": [
      "Immediate and strong emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'that cringe spiral is so real' that normalize the teen's experience",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact scripts ('My bad about earlier, I got flustered') and concrete physical resets (switch rooms, wash face, change song) that are realistic for a teen to execute",
      "Natural conversational flow using teen-appropriate filler words ('like') and casual transitions ('Honestly though') without sounding forced"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person perspective in the advice section (missing 'I think' or 'I'd suggest') which makes the practical tips feel slightly more generic than the warm opening",
      "The transition from validation to advice with 'Honestly though' is slightly abrupt, though still natural"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The response uses pure natural prose with zero bullet points or formatting, allowing advice to flow conversationally within paragraphs like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The advice section relies on general 'you' statements and imperative suggestions rather than incorporating first-person language ('I think the best approach would be...') to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Integrate more first-person language into the advice section such as 'I think the best move is...' or 'I'd suggest trying...' to maintain the personal, supportive voice throughout",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing before the question to reinforce the supportive relationship"
