      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation",
      "Provides specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I feel like things are a little off between us. Is something bothering you?'",
      "Strong follow-up question that brings focus back to the teen's emotions: 'How's this whole situation making you feel?'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective and opinions - could use more 'I think' or 'I'd say' instead of general statements like 'People often hold back'",

      "Middle paragraph explaining why people hold back feels slightly clinical/detached rather than personally empathetic"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective to create connection: instead of 'People often hold back...' try 'I think people often hold back...' or 'I'd guess they're probably...'",
      "Include one warm emoji early in the response (like 😕 or 😅) to match the 'frustrating and confusing' emotional tone",
      "Make the psychological explanation more personal: instead of listing reasons people hold back, try 'I get why they'd be hesitant to bring it up - maybe they're worried about starting drama or still figuring out what they're actually feeling'"
