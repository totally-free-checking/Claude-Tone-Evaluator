      "Immediate emotional validation with specific physical descriptions ('makes your face burn and your brain just spiral') that show deep empathy for the embarrassment",
      "Specific, actionable script for talking to the coach ('I want to improve, but getting yelled at in front of everyone kinda threw me off...') that gives the teen exact words to use",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Limited first-person perspective phrases beyond the opening 'I'm so sorry' - missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' that would make it feel more like a personal conversation",
