    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Oof, that stings!' and 'totally natural to feel hurt'",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact script the teen could use: 'Oh I saw you guys hung out! How was it?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal constructions like 'Try not to' and 'Have you thought about' instead",
      "Asks two questions at the end rather than one natural follow-up, which feels slightly interrogative",
      "Missing the warm, personal sign-off like 'I'm here if you need to talk' that would reinforce support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a text message from a friend rather than a structured self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective makes the response feel like general advice rather than a personal conversation with a supportive friend who is sharing their own thoughts",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout, such as 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd probably try...' or 'I get why that hurts' to create a more personal connection",
      "Consolidate the ending into one engaging question rather than two, such as 'Do you think this was a one-off thing, or has this been happening a lot lately?'",
      "Consider adding a brief personal sign-off like 'I'm here if you need to talk through it more' to reinforce the supportive relationship"
