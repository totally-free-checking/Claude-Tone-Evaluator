    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with visceral language ('that 'everyone saw it' feeling is *so* brutal,' 'your stomach drops all over again') that makes the teen feel truly understood",
      "Excellent use of first-person framing throughout ('I totally get why,' 'If I were you, I'd try,' 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question combines two distinct questions ('What exactly happened, and are you worried...'), which slightly complicates the engagement though both are relevant",
      "The grounding technique description ('feet on the floor, 5 things you can see') is slightly dense in the middle paragraph, though still conversational"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, flowing seamlessly between validation, reassurance, and actionable advice like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The compound follow-up question asks both for details of the event and the emotional source simultaneously, which could be simplified to one focused question",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice is woven naturally into conversational paragraphs using phrases like 'Like, when it pops up' and 'After that' to create flow rather than structural formatting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider splitting the final question into a single focused question or ensuring the compound question flows as naturally as it currently does (which it mostly does)",
      "The 😅 emoji is well-placed and appropriate for the 'cringe' nature of the situation, but ensure it doesn't minimize the distress; in this case it works because it follows strong validation"
