    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd bring it up', 'I'd start protecting your time') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I've noticed plans keep getting cancelled last minute. Is everything okay?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with natural flow between validation and advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother - 'If I were you' comes somewhat quickly after validation without a brief bridging acknowledgment",
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense with multiple scenarios (family stuff, anxiety, strict parents, mental health) which could potentially be overwhelming, though still manageable"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with consistent first-person perspective and conversational flow - uses 'I'd', 'I'm', and 'If I were you' throughout rather than impersonal directives",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight abruptness in transition from emotional validation to practical solutions - could use one more sentence bridging the empathy to the advice",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The advice flows naturally within paragraph form with specific examples integrated into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief transitional phrase between validation and advice like 'I know it's hard, but here's what I'd try' to soften the shift from feelings to action",
      "The advice section covers many scenarios (family, anxiety, parents, mental health) which is thorough, but could be slightly condensed to maintain the conversational brevity while keeping the specific script suggestion which is excellent"
