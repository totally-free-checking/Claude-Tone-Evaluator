    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a natural text conversation with natural paragraph flow",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen social situations (asking about the host, commenting on music/food, bathroom/drink exit strategy)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother - 'Honestly though' shifts tone quickly after the empathetic opening",
      "Could include one more validating phrase about the specific anxiety of not knowing anyone before moving to 'the good news is'"

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief bridge between validation and advice like 'That said, here are a few things that might help' to smooth the transition",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific - maintain this level of engagement in future responses"
