    "strengths": [
      "Ends with a specific, engaging follow-up question that invites the teen to share more details about their grade and subject preferences",
      "Provides concrete, realistic advice that considers actual teen constraints like work, sports, and graduation requirements",
      "Uses reassuring opening language like 'you're definitely not alone' and reframes 'behind' as 'planning stage'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely heavy use of bullet points and numbered lists (5 numbered sections with sub-bullets) instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - doesn't use 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it' to create personal connection",
      "Brief validation (one sentence) is immediately followed by extensive structured advice without balancing emotional support throughout"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - ends with a natural, specific invitation to continue the conversation about grade level and subject preferences",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - reads like a wikiHow article or school handbook rather than a text conversation, with 15+ structured list items and minimal paragraph text",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 15,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses 5 numbered headers with bold formatting and 10 sub-bullet points. Only 3 short paragraphs of actual prose at beginning and end. Heavy formatting creates distance rather than conversational intimacy."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice section as 2-3 natural paragraphs instead of numbered lists - for example, 'I'd start by checking your graduation requirements, then try to balance challenging classes with ones you actually enjoy...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout using phrases like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'When I was in school...' to sound like a supportive friend rather than an instruction manual",
      "Expand the emotional validation before diving into solutions - acknowledge the anxiety more fully with something like 'I totally get that sinking feeling when everyone else seems to have it figured out'"
