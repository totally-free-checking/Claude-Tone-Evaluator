    "strengths": [
      "The follow-up question is specific and relevant, asking about the platform and timing which shows genuine interest in helping them figure out the specific scenario",
      "Practical advice is very concrete and realistic for teens, including specific platform behaviors and the 'block/unblock' trick for extreme cases",
      "Opens with casual acknowledgment ('Oof, classic') that recognizes the relatable awkwardness of the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely heavy use of bullet points and formatting (headers, bold text) makes it read like a wiki article rather than a supportive conversation - the entire response is structured as lists",
      "Lacks emotional validation beyond 'Oof, classic' - doesn't acknowledge the embarrassment, anxiety, or 'sinking feeling' of being caught stalking",
      "Missing first-person supportive language like 'I get it,' 'I'd feel the same way,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' - feels impersonal and instructional rather than supportive",
      "Jumps immediately to solutions without reassuring the teen that this happens to everyone or validating their feelings first"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality and specificity, including platform-specific nuances and realistic damage control options that acknowledge teen social dynamics",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting - it uses multiple bullet lists, bold headers, and structured sections rather than natural conversational paragraphs, making it feel like a technical guide rather than a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response relies heavily on bullet formatting with bold text markers (**, ###). The structure is: intro sentence, bullet list, header, bullet list, question. This reads like a help article rather than a text conversation. Only the first sentence and last sentence are prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural paragraphs without bullet points - instead of listing 'Unlike it immediately' as a bullet, write something like 'I'd say unlike it immediately if you haven't already. That's usually your best move.'",
      "Add emotional validation before advice: 'That stomach-drop feeling when you realize you liked something from 2019 is THE WORST. I'm so sorry - that kind of accidental deep-scroll reveal is basically a modern teen rite of passage at this point.'",
      "Use more first-person language throughout: 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd probably just...' instead of impersonal instructional language",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅) after 'Oof, classic' to soften the tone and acknowledge the awkwardness"
