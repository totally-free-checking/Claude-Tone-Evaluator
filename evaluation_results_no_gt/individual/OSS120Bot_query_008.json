    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I can totally see why you're stuck') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can literally use ('Hey, I got invited to [friend's] party on [day]...') including logistics like transportation and curfew",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow—no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring; reads like a text from a supportive older sibling"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from emotional validation to practical advice could be slightly smoother—moves quickly from 'It's not as scary as it feels' directly into 'If I were you, I'd start...'",
      "Could include slightly more validation about the specific fear of parental disappointment or rejection before offering solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language usage—uses natural contractions, casual phrasing ('Ugh', 'yeah'), and consistently employs 'I' statements ('I'd say', 'If I were you') that make it feel like genuine peer support rather than an impersonal guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward practical advice over emotional validation—while it opens with warmth, the middle section is heavily weighted toward the 'how-to' script with only brief reassurance before diving into logistics",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with zero bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences ('Mention any details that matter, like who’s there...') rather than being listed out. This is the ideal formatting approach for this character."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of emotional validation between the reassurance and the advice—perhaps acknowledging that it's nerve-wracking because you care about their trust or don't want to disappoint them",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of situational specificity in future responses"
