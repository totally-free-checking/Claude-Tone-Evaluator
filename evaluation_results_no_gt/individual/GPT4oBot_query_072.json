    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Oh no, I totally get how awkward that can feel!' that acknowledges the specific embarrassment",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with 4 well-sized paragraphs",
      "Strong first-person connection using 'I totally get' and casual teen-appropriate language like 'cringe,' 'chill,' and 'low-key' without sounding forced"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses second-person imperative ('try focusing,' 'you could laugh') rather than first-person framing like 'I'd suggest' or 'I think it helps to' which would strengthen the personal connection",
      "Could offer more specific script examples for what to actually say to the partner in the moment"

      "Add explicit first-person framing to advice section, e.g., change 'If you can, try focusing...' to 'I'd suggest focusing...' or 'I think it really helps to...'",
      "Consider offering 1-2 specific phrases the teen could actually say to their partner, like 'Want to just laugh about how awkward this is?' to make the advice even more actionable"
