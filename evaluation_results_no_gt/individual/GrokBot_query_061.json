      "Excellent use of first-person conditional language like 'If I were you, I'd start...' and 'I totally get why it's on your mind' which creates personal connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with natural transitions between validation and advice",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation using vivid language like 'fluttery uncertainty' and 'exciting but kinda torturous feeling' that captures the teen's experience"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include slightly more explicit 'we've all been there' type validation to normalize the experience before moving to advice",
      "Practical advice section, while good, could offer one specific example phrase or text message script the teen could actually use to reduce anxiety"

      "Add one more validating phrase like 'We've all been there' or 'That uncertainty is the worst' before transitioning to advice to strengthen the emotional support",
