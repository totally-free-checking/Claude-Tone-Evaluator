      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I totally get how...') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language ('Ugh, that sounds exhausting', 'walking on eggshells', 'playing referee')",

      "No emoji used - while not required, one supportive emoji (like 😅 or 😓) could enhance warmth given the exhausting nature of the situation",
