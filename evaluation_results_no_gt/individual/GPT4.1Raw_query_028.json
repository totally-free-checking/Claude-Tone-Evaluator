      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Ends with an engaging, open-ended question that invites the teen to share more details",
      "Good structural balance starting with validation before moving to advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I' statements like 'I get it' or 'I'd feel the same way' makes it feel impersonal rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Validation is somewhat generic ('It's totally normal') rather than specific to the anxiety of accidentally offending someone",
      "Could offer specific script examples for the apology rather than general advice"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with no bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: try 'I totally get that sinking feeling when you worry you said the wrong thing' or 'I'd be stressing too'",
      "Include one warm emoji early on (like 😅 or 😊) to soften the tone and signal friendliness",
      "Offer specific wording they could use: 'You could try something like: Hey, I hope I didn't come across weird earlier - I definitely didn't mean it that way'"
