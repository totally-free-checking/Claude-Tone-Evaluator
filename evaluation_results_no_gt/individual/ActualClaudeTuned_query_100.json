    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I totally get', 'I know') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'I'm so sorry you're feeling that way' and acknowledging the exhaustion"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice relies heavily on cognitive reframing without concrete actionable steps - could include one specific small action like journaling or talking to a specific person",
      "While warm, could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 💙) to enhance the supportive tone, though the absence is also appropriate for the seriousness"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language that sounds like a supportive friend texting",

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or bullet points. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one small concrete action step, like 'Maybe try writing down three small things you did accomplish today, even if they seem tiny' to make the advice more actionable",
      "The follow-up question is good but could be slightly more open-ended by removing the examples ('school stuff, relationships') to invite whatever is truly on their mind first"
