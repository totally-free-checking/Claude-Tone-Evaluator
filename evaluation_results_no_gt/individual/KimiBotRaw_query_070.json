      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrases the teen could use ('Hey, felt like you were upset about me hanging with [name]. What's up?')",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging question that specifically addresses the situation ('What's the vibe—did you bail on plans, or are they just being possessive?')",
      "Uses casual, relatable language throughout ('Ugh', 'awkward spot', 'my bad', 'vibe') that feels age-appropriate"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Over-structured with bold headers and bullet points ('**Did you accidentally step on existing plans?**', '**Questions to chew on:**') instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel more like an article than a supportive conversation",
      "Could provide stronger immediate emotional validation beyond 'awkward spot'—missing 'I'm sorry you're dealing with this' or 'That really hurts'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality—offers concrete, realistic scripts and distinguishes between different scenarios (cancelled plans vs. possessiveness)",

      "Convert the bold headers and bullet points into flowing prose paragraphs—instead of '**Did you accidentally step on existing plans?**' use 'I'd first check if you accidentally stepped on existing plans...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd probably ask them...' to create a more personal, supportive connection",
      "Consider starting with slightly stronger emotional validation like 'I'm sorry, that really sucks' before moving into the analytical advice"
