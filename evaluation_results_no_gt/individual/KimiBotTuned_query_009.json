    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific language naming the 'icky, exposed feeling' and acknowledging the violation of privacy",
      "Excellent use of first-person natural language throughout ('I'm so sorry','I get you're trying','Honestly') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic conversation scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, you've been acting kinda off...','I get you're trying to keep me safe...')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The third paragraph is slightly dense with advice; breaking into two shorter paragraphs could improve mobile readability",
      "While 😅 works for awkwardness, 😬 might have more precisely matched the 'exposed' vulnerability described"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or bold text. Uses quotation marks naturally within sentences to suggest dialogue without breaking conversational flow."

      "Consider splitting the third paragraph after 'over-apologizing' to create more white space for mobile readability",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of contextual engagement in future responses"
