      "Excellent natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a smooth conversational flow that reads like a text message",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end, failing to invite the teen to share more about their specific situation or continue the conversation",
      "Lacks first-person perspective and sharing (no 'I'd say,' 'I think,' or 'I get it'), making the response feel more like generic pep-talk advice than a personal connection from a supportive friend"

      "End with a specific, engaging follow-up question like 'What kind of change are you thinking about?' or 'Has anyone commented on your appearance before?' to invite the teen to share more",
      "Incorporate more first-person language like 'I'd be nervous too' or 'I think starting small is smart' to create a stronger sense of personal connection and shared experience",
      "Consider spending one more sentence validating the specific fear of comments before pivoting to the 'but here's the thing' reframing, to ensure the teen feels fully heard"
