    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you, I'd maybe try', 'I think') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I totally get that stuff comes up...') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such a frustrating feeling', 'it honestly stings') before offering solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) to enhance the supportive tone, though the absence is acceptable",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use one more sentence bridging the emotional support to the practical suggestion",
      "The follow-up question is technically a compound question (two questions joined by 'or'), which is slightly less ideal than a single focused question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - maintains conversational flow throughout with paragraphs that read like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of emoji when one could enhance warmth - while 0-1 is the guideline, a single supportive emoji would have strengthened the emotional connection for this frustrating situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose with three flowing paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice is woven into sentences rather than listed as steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😊) at the end of the first paragraph to enhance emotional connection",
      "Add a brief transitional sentence between the validation and advice sections, such as 'I wonder if it might help to gently check in with them about it?' to smooth the shift from feelings to action",
      "While the compound question at the end works, consider focusing on just one angle (either asking about recent stress OR whether it's out of character) for cleaner conversation flow"
