    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry… that 'I'm only good enough when it's convenient' feeling hurts so bad' which names the specific pain and validates it",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points—flows naturally from validation to advice to follow-up like a real conversation",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including an exact script the teen can use: 'Hey, I've been feeling like I'm only included last minute lately, and it's been kinda hurting. Am I imagining that?'",
      "Excellent follow-up question that asks for specific examples (texting when bored, inviting when others can't) rather than generic 'how are you feeling'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses impersonal constructions like 'It can help to…' and 'you can also…' rather than first-person suggestions like 'I think you could try…' or 'I'd suggest…' which would feel more supportive and personal",
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched to the emotional weight of the topic (feeling hurt about friendship), though only one emoji is used"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose flow with zero bullet points or formatting—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Lack of first-person framing in the advice section (uses 'it can help' and 'you can' instead of 'I think you should' or 'I'd try')",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to the advice section like 'I think you could try…' or 'I'd suggest…' instead of 'It can help to…' to make it feel more like personal guidance from a friend",
      "Consider using 😔 or 💙 instead of 😅 for painful emotional topics, or omit the emoji entirely, as 😅 can sometimes read as making light of the situation",
      "Include an explicit 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar first-person availability statement to reinforce the supportive relationship"
