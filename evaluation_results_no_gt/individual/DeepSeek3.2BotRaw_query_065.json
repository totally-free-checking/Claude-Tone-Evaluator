      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use (e.g., 'I always feel a bit off talking about people when they aren’t here to explain their side')",
      "Acknowledges the difficulty of the situation and validates the user's maturity in recognizing the issue"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - closes with a statement instead of engaging the user to continue the conversation",
      "Heavy reliance on numbered lists and bullet points (6 main sections with sub-bullets) rather than conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' to create personal connection",
      "Jumps quickly to solutions without sufficient emotional validation upfront"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - the specific phrases and scripts provided are realistic and immediately usable for a teen in this situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting structure - using 6 numbered sections with headers and bullet points makes it read like a self-help article rather than a text conversation with a supportive friend",

      "notes": "Response uses 6 numbered headers (### 1., ### 2., etc.) with multiple bullet points under each section. Only the opening and closing sentences are prose. This is extremely over-formatted and violates the 'natural prose paragraphs' requirement."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the numbered list into 2-3 natural paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of 'Here are 6 ways,' try 'I think I'd probably start by changing the subject when it comes up. You could say something like...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - use phrases like 'I get why that feels uncomfortable' or 'I'd probably feel torn too if I liked them but hated the gossip'",
      "End with a specific, engaging question to continue the conversation, such as 'Do you think they'd be receptive if you mentioned it, or are you worried it might make things weird?'",
      "Start with more immediate emotional validation before offering solutions - acknowledge the awkwardness of being put in that position"
