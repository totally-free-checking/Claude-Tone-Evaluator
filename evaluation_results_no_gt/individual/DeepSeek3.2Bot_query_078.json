    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get it', 'I think you could try', 'I appreciate you') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I appreciate you reaching out, but I'm just really focused on my own stuff right now')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen validation about the guilt or discomfort of not reciprocating friendship feelings before jumping to solutions",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use a softer bridge like 'If you want my take...'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - maintains conversational flow throughout with advice embedded in sentences rather than listed",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with three natural paragraphs. Advice is woven into sentences ('give short but kind answers, don't initiate plans') rather than listed. No headers, bold text, or structural formatting used."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence validating the guilt or discomfort of not liking someone back before offering the 'you don't owe anyone' perspective",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be slightly more open-ended to invite deeper sharing beyond just the binary choice presented"
