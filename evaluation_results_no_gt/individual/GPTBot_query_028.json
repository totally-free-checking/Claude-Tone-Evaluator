    "strengths": [
      "Provides a specific, actionable apology script that teens can actually use: 'Hey— I'm realizing what I said could've come off rude. I didn't mean it that way. I'm sorry. What I meant was ____.'",
      "Offers to personalize the advice by helping rewrite the message to fit their specific style and situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses three bullet points to ask clarifying questions, making it feel like an intake form or survey rather than a natural conversation",
      "Minimal emotional validation - 'Totally happens' is too brief and dismissive of the anxiety/regret the teen is likely feeling; lacks acknowledgment of the emotional weight",
      "Does not end with a question to continue the conversation; ends with a conditional statement ('If you tell me... I can help') instead of an engaging follow-up",
      "Asks multiple questions at once (three in a row) which can feel overwhelming"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific apology template is concrete, realistic for teens, and immediately usable",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose vs bullets - heavy reliance on bullet points for questions instead of natural paragraph flow, creating a structured/form-like feel",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Uses three distinct bullet points to ask clarifying questions (what did you say, who was it to, how did they react), dominating the middle section. This creates a clinical, intake-form feel rather than the requested conversational prose format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose flow: 'I'd love to help you figure this out. What did you say roughly, and was it over text or in person? Who was it to, and how did they react?'",
      "Add genuine emotional validation upfront before asking questions: 'That sinking feeling when you realize you might have hurt someone's feelings is absolutely the worst. You're definitely not alone in this - we've all been there.'",
      "End with a specific, engaging question to continue the conversation: 'What exactly did you say that you're worried about?'",
      "Use first-person language when giving advice to feel more supportive: 'I'd suggest sending something like...' or 'I think a quick repair text would work well...' instead of 'a solid default move is...'"
