    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with visceral language like 'punch to the gut' and acknowledging the 'brave face' they're putting on",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you', 'I'd take', 'I hear you') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation between friends",
      "Specific actionable advice tailored to teen agency (suggesting casual pick-up groups and coach conversations)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😔 or 💙) to enhance emotional connection at the start",
      "Advice about talking to the coach could be more specific with suggested phrasing for an intimidated teen",
      "The 'you'll find something cooler' perspective in paragraph two, while well-intentioned, slightly rushes past the validation of current disappointment"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than an advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while zero emojis is acceptable, one well-placed supportive emoji could have enhanced the warmth without being excessive",

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the end of the first sentence (like 😔 or 💙) to visually reinforce empathy",
      "Provide a specific script for approaching the coach (e.g., 'Hey coach, do you have two minutes? I wanted to ask what I could work on for next time') to make the advice less intimidating",
      "The follow-up question is excellent - keep using this specific, situation-based questioning style"
