      "Excellent first-person language that creates connection ('If I were in your spot, I'd probably...','I think')",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation that names the specific feeling ('Ugh, that sucks','like every second is moving in slow motion')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😅) to enhance warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the somber topic",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to signal warmth, though this is optional given the serious tone",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more open-ended like 'What's your gut telling you to do right now?' to invite more sharing rather than the either/or structure",
      "Maintain the excellent use of first-person language ('I'd say','I think') as this is a key differentiator for the teen support character"
