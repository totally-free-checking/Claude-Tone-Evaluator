      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such a tough spot to be in!' and reassurance that guilt doesn't make them a bad person",

      "Practical advice could be slightly more specific regarding concrete phrases or scripts for being upfront with the people involved",

      "Consider adding a specific example phrase like 'You could say something like: I really like spending time with you, but I want to be honest that I'm also getting to know someone else right now' to make the advice more actionable",
      "Extend the validation section by one sentence explicitly naming the specific emotion (e.g., 'That confusion and worry about hurting someone is so heavy to carry') before transitioning to problem-solving"
