    "strengths": [
      "Exceptional immediate validation with relatable metaphors ('tool on their shelf') and emotional acknowledgment ('crappy, lonely feeling', 'sucky')",
      "Masterful use of first-person language throughout ('I get why', 'I think I'd start', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice that respects teen agency (observing patterns, strategically pulling back) while acknowledging the emotional risk"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The advice section is slightly longer than the validation section, creating a minor imbalance toward solutions",
      "Could briefly acknowledge that directly communicating needs to the friend is also a valid option alongside the 'pull back' strategy"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - consistently uses 'I' statements and casual phrasing ('Honestly', 'totally', 'sucky') that makes it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling rather than receiving generic advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward advice over validation - while validation is strong upfront, the single long paragraph of practical advice could be broken up with more emotional check-ins",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two smaller ones to improve readability on mobile and create more breathing room between the advice points",
      "Could add one brief validating sentence midway through the advice section (e.g., 'And honestly? You don't owe anyone immediate replies') to maintain emotional connection while giving practical steps"
