    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I'm just telling you') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, can we not make this a competition? I just wanna chill')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so draining' and reassurance that they're not being 'too sensitive'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use one more bridging sentence of emotional support before 'If I were you'",
      "The advice section is slightly dense; breaking into two paragraphs might improve readability on mobile, though this is minor"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses natural contractions, casual phrasing ('wanna', 'kinda', 'kills the vibe'), and personal perspective ('If I were you') throughout, making it feel like a real supportive friend rather than an AI",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The balance slightly favors practical advice over emotional validation, with roughly 60% advice and 40% validation, whereas ideal might be closer to 50/50 or leading with more validation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, perfectly matching the ideal conversational style."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of validation between the acknowledgment of insecurity and the advice section to soften the transition",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be made slightly more open-ended by asking 'What kinds of things do they usually compete about?' instead of the either/or format, though the current version is still very good"
