    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation ('Oh man, that's such a tricky situation!' and 'It's totally normal to need some breathing room') that immediately normalizes the teen's feelings",
      "Provides excellent specific scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed lately...') rather than vague platitudes",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specifics of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers ('Be honest but kind:', 'Set some boundaries:', 'Redirect the energy:') makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a text from a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - uses impersonal directives instead, creating distance rather than connection",
      "The transition 'Here are a few gentle ways to handle it:' signals a shift into list-mode rather than maintaining conversational flow"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific, realistic scripts and actionable steps that a teen could actually use in this awkward situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting and structure - uses three bold headers with seven bullet points, making it feel like an instructional guide rather than a supportive conversation",

      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold headers ('Be honest but kind:', 'Set some boundaries:', 'Redirect the energy:') with bullet lists under each. Only the opening paragraph, transition sentence, and closing paragraph are in prose form. This heavy structuring prevents the natural conversational flow essential to the character."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as natural prose paragraphs instead of bullet lists - for example, 'I'd suggest being honest but kind. You could say something like...' rather than bold headers and bullets",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - use phrases like 'I think the key is...', 'I'd probably...', or 'I get how awkward that conversation feels' to sound like a supportive friend rather than an advice column",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though zero is acceptable"
