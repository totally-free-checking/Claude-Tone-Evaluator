    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation from start to finish",
      "Highly specific, teen-relevant advice that mentions realistic scenarios (sitting next to you in class, playful emojis, sending GIFs) rather than generic dating advice",
      "Excellent follow-up question that invites the user to share specific details and continues the conversation naturally"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section lacks first-person language - uses impersonal 'you can' and 'do they' rather than 'I'd suggest' or 'I usually look for', creating distance between the speaker and advice",
      "Could deepen emotional validation by acknowledging the specific anxiety or stress of uncertainty before jumping to 'the good news'",
      "Opens with validation but transitions quickly to solutions; could spend slightly more time sitting with the emotional experience"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Limited first-person perspective in the advice section, making the middle portion feel more instructional than supportive",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no bullet points, numbered lists, or bold headers. The colon after 'few things' introduces embedded questions within the prose flow, which is acceptable and natural."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Integrate more first-person language into the advice section (e.g., 'I'd probably look for patterns...' or 'I usually suggest trying...') to maintain the supportive friend persona throughout",
      "Deepen the emotional validation by acknowledging how stressful or anxiety-inducing that uncertainty feels before offering 'the good news' - validate the feeling before fixing it"
