    "strengths": [
      "Strong first-person language that creates connection ('I'm here', 'I'm all ears', 'Totally get why')",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Totally get why that feels tricky', 'weight of someone's trust lands right in your hands')",
      "Appropriate single emoji usage (💬) that fits the conversational context without being excessive"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Contains a structured bullet point list ('Here are a few questions...' with 3 bullet items) which breaks the conversational prose flow",
      "Does not end with a follow-up question; closes with a statement ('I'm all ears') rather than engaging the user to share more",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose by integrating the reflective questions into a paragraph ('You might ask yourself whether your friend meant for you to keep it private, or if it's something that could hurt someone...')",
      "End with a specific, engaging question about their situation rather than a statement ('What kind of vibe did you get when they told you—were they looking for support or just venting?')",
      "Include one concrete example of what they could say to their friend if they feel uncomfortable holding the secret"
