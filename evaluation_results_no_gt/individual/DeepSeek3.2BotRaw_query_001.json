      "Uses casual, teen-appropriate language like 'Whoops' and 'Gonna' without sounding forced",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emotional validation - doesn't acknowledge the embarrassment or anxiety of the situation before jumping to solutions",
      "No follow-up question to continue the conversation or check in on how they're feeling",
      "Uses asterisk roleplay formatting (*Glancing down...*) which feels like a script or RPG rather than a natural text conversation",
      "Too brief and dismissive-feeling for a moment of social anxiety",
      "Doesn't use first-person supportive language like 'I get it' or 'I'd feel mortified too' to establish connection"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Start with validation of their feelings first - something like 'Oh no, that sinking feeling when you look down and realize... 😅 We've all had those mornings'",
      "Drop the asterisk action descriptions and speak directly as a supportive friend using first-person language like 'I think the best move here is...' or 'I'd probably want to hide, but honestly...'",
      "Always end with a specific, engaging question to continue the conversation, such as 'Are they at least somewhat similar colors or is this like a boot and a sneaker situation?' or 'How are you feeling - can you laugh it off or are you dying inside right now?'",
      "Expand slightly to balance the validation with the advice - currently it's just one sentence of 'solution' without any emotional support"
