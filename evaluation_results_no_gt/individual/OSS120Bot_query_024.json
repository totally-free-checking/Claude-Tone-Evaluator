    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that totally hurts' and the physical description of 'stomach drop' that makes the teen feel truly seen and understood",
      "Excellent natural prose with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than an advice article",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you', 'I'd try') creating personal connection and specific actionable script ('Hey, I heard you all got together...') that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice feels slightly mismatched with the hurt feelings described; it conveys nervous laughter/awkwardness rather than empathy for emotional pain",
      "Could benefit from one additional sentence of validation between the acknowledgment and the 'If I were you' advice to strengthen the emotional support buffer"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero structural elements (no bullets, headers, or bold text), creating an authentic peer-to-peer texting feel",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection which uses 😅 (nervous/awkward) rather than a more empathetic choice like 💙 or 😔 for a situation involving hurt feelings and exclusion",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. Advice flows organically within sentences ('If I were you, I'd try reaching out...') rather than being listed as actionable items. No headers, bold text, or numbered lists present."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace 😅 with 💙 or 😔 to better match the emotional weight of being excluded, or omit the emoji entirely for serious hurt feelings",
      "Add one brief validating sentence like 'You deserve to feel included' between the validation and advice sections to strengthen the emotional buffer before moving to solutions",
      "Maintain the current first-person approach ('If I were you', 'I'd say') as it creates excellent rapport and makes the advice feel personal rather than prescriptive"
