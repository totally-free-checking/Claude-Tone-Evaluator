      "Immediate emotional validation with specific physical description ('That little knot in your stomach') that shows deep empathy for the teen's experience",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you', 'I know') creating a personal, supportive connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice section could include one specific conversation starter phrase the teen could actually use in the moment",

      "Consider adding one specific phrase the teen could use during the conversation, like 'Can you give me a quick heads up if this is good news or bad news? My anxiety is spiraling'",
      "The reassurance that 'it might be something good' is helpful, but could be balanced with validation that even if it's hard, they have the capacity to handle it"
