    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation throughout with phrases like 'Feeling guilty is normal' and 'You're not wrong or weak for stepping away' that immediately normalize the teen's experience",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong balance of validation and practical advice, starting with empathy before offering concrete reflection questions (Is it draining your energy? Is it no longer bringing you joy?)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could strengthen first-person connection with more explicit 'I think' or 'I'd say' statements rather than general observations",

      "Add 1-2 explicit first-person phrases like 'I think the key thing here is...' or 'I'd suggest starting by...' to make it feel more like a personal conversation",
      "Include a specific example script for what to say when quitting, such as 'You could try saying something like: I've really valued my time here, but I need to step back to focus on...'"
