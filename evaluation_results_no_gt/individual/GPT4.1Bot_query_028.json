    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with physical description ('stomach flip-flops') that captures the anxiety of the situation perfectly",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get why you'd be stressing', 'If I were in your shoes, I'd probably...') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I hope that didn't come off rude earlier—I didn't mean it like that')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 😅) to enhance warmth, though the absence is not problematic for this slightly serious topic",
      "The normalization in the second paragraph slightly repeats the validation from the first, though it serves the purpose of reducing the teen's isolation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose flow with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to visually signal warmth, though the text alone is already very warm",
      "The response is exemplary overall; maintain this balance of immediate validation followed by specific actionable scripts and natural follow-up questions"
