    "weaknesses": [
      "No engaging follow-up question to continue the conversation; ends with a rhetorical 'okay?' rather than inviting the teen to share more",

      "Make the self-care advice more concrete by suggesting specific 5-minute actions a teen could actually do today, like 'Try writing down three things you did well today, even if they're tiny'"
