    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation: 'That's a really crappy spot to be in—watching someone you care about get pulled into a meaner vibe' acknowledges the emotional difficulty immediately",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I've noticed you've been talking about people differently lately...') and concrete boundary-setting language",
      "Follow-up questions are specific and tailored to the situation (asking about age, specific behaviors, and whether the change happens around the group or with the user specifically)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - uses impersonal instructional tone throughout ('you can', 'aim for', 'try to') instead of sounding like a supportive friend sharing perspective",
      "Severely over-structured with markdown headers (###), numbered lists, and bullet points rather than natural prose paragraphs - reads like a wikiHow article rather than a text conversation",
      "Emotional validation is limited to the first sentence before immediately pivoting to 'A few things that can help' and 5 structured steps, creating an imbalanced advice-heavy response"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, specific scripts and actionable steps that a teen could actually use in this difficult conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses extensive formatting with headers, numbered sections, and bullet lists instead of conversational paragraphs",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 5 main numbered sections with markdown headers (###) and multiple sub-bullet points under each. Only the opening sentence and brief transitions are in prose form. Reads as a structured guide rather than a supportive message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as 2-3 flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd probably start by...' instead of imperative instructions and numbered lists",
      "Spend more time on emotional validation before offering solutions - expand on that opening sentence with more 'I get how hard that is' type language before weaving in advice naturally",
      "Remove all headers (###), numbered lists, and bullet points entirely to match the 'natural prose paragraphs' requirement of the character"
