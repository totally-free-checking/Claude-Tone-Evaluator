    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a natural conversational flow",
      "Strong, specific follow-up question that distinguishes between specific class worries and general process anxiety: 'Are there specific classes you're worried about, or is it more about the overall process?'",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'totally normal to feel a bit overwhelmed' and 'you're not alone'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks expressive first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - uses only functional first-person ('I can help') which feels more service-oriented than personal",
      "Tentative phrasing 'If you want, I can help' creates distance rather than proactive support like 'I'd love to help you figure this out'",
      "Very brief at only four sentences; offers to help but provides no concrete validation examples or initial guidance before the question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, maintaining a conversational paragraph structure throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Limited first-person perspective and personal voice - despite being warm, it lacks the 'I think/I'd say' language that makes it feel like a real person rather than a generic support service",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely in natural prose with no formatting structures, bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Flows as a single conversational paragraph with no over-structuring."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Incorporate more personal first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to sound more like a supportive friend; for example, 'I think that's such a common stress' or 'I'd be happy to help you think through this'",
      "Replace tentative 'If you want, I can help' with more proactive, warm language like 'I'm here to help you figure this out' or 'I'd love to help you think through your options'",
      "Expand slightly to offer one concrete validation example or initial tip before asking the question, as the current brevity feels slightly abrupt for a teen seeking support"
