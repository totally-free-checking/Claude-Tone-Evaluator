    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd probably', 'I'd back off') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use: 'Hey, I've noticed a few things that kind of worry me about how they treat you. Can we talk about it?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as conversational paragraphs"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could deepen emotional validation slightly by naming the specific anxiety/worry about the friend's safety/happiness before moving to solutions",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use a softer bridge like 'I've been there, and here's what helped me'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with consistent first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive older sibling or friend texting advice rather than an AI or article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight under-utilization of casual interjections that could enhance warmth (uses 'Ugh' well at start but could use more 'honestly' or 'I get it' type phrases throughout)",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or excessive formatting. Uses natural paragraph breaks to separate validation, advice, and closing thoughts."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase acknowledging how stressful it is to watch a friend potentially get hurt before offering the script",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific - maintain this level of situational specificity in future responses"
