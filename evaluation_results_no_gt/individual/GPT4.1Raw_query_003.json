      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message",
      "Strong conversational tone using contractions (It's, you're, I'm) and casual language ('rough', 'weird feeling')",
      "Good follow-up question that offers specific options ('avoid conversation' vs 'hoping it's not too uncomfortable') showing genuine interest in their specific needs"

    "weaknesses": [
      "No practical advice actually provided - only offers to give tips later rather than providing at least one concrete suggestion now",

      "Include at least one concrete piece of advice while still offering to vent (e.g., 'I'd probably just start with a quick hey to break the tension, but if you want to keep it surface-level, that's totally valid too')",
      "Add one emoji early in the response to enhance warmth (like 😅 after 'rough' or 😬 after 'weird feeling')",
      "Expand slightly with one more sentence of validation about how common this situation is before asking the question"
