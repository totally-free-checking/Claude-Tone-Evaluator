    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'I totally get that' and acknowledging the specific worry about parents saying no or asking questions",
      "Provides concrete, actionable scripts like 'Hey, I got invited to a party this weekend. Here's where it is and who will be there. Can I go?' that teens can actually use",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and no bullet points - reads like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses 2 emojis (😅 and 😊) when the ideal is 0-1 max - slightly over the recommended limit",
      "Ends with two questions/prompts ('Do you think...' and 'Let me know...') rather than one streamlined follow-up question",
      "Could use more explicit first-person language in the advice section (e.g., 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you should') rather than general 'you' statements"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - it offers specific phrases to say to parents and realistic compromises like offering to text updates, which is exactly what a teen needs in this situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - having two emojis exceeds the '0-1 max' guideline for this character, even though they are appropriately chosen",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent natural prose throughout with no bullet points or lists. Uses italics for emphasis on key details (who's hosting, what time) which enhances readability without breaking conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consolidate the ending into one natural question instead of two separate prompts - for example, 'Do you think they'll need all the details, or are they more laid-back about parties?'",
      "Remove one emoji (probably the 😊 at the end) to stay within the 0-1 guideline, or keep just the 😅 which fits the nervousness theme better",
      "Add more first-person perspective to the advice section, such as 'I'd probably approach it by...' or 'In my experience, parents respond better when...' to increase the personal connection"
