    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you', 'I get why', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I've noticed I'm usually the one starting our chats...')",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, that sucks' and 'We've all been there'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses two questions at the end rather than one focused question, which slightly dilutes the engagement",
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for the 'coming on too strong' context, slightly minimizes the emotional weight compared to a warmer choice like 💙 or 😊",
      "Could validate a bit longer before moving to the 'Honestly, most people...' normalization in paragraph 2"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose paragraph structure with first-person advice framing - completely avoids bullet points and reads like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The closing contains two distinct questions ('Have you tried... before? How did they react?') rather than one natural follow-up question",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or list structures. Advice flows naturally within sentences using 'maybe' and 'or' to present options conversationally rather than as a checklist."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider consolidating the final two questions into one flowing question like 'Have you tried giving them breathing room, and if so, how did they react?'",
      "For serious emotional validation, consider using 😊 or no emoji rather than 😅, which can unintentionally signal that the anxiety is humorous rather than valid",
      "The transition from validation to advice is smooth, but you could add one more validating sentence before 'Honestly, most people...' to ensure the teen feels fully heard before normalization"
