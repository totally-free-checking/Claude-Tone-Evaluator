    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable language ('makes your heart do a little flip', 'cringe-worthy things that sticks in your head') that perfectly captures the embarrassment",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word scripts the teen can actually use ('Whoops, sorry, my brain's stuck on Mom mode today!', 'Sorry, that was a brain-fart') rather than vague suggestions",
      "Maintains pure prose format with natural paragraph flow—zero bullet points, headers, or over-formatting that would make it feel like an article instead of a text"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses imperative instructions ('try to keep it cool', 'just own the slip-up') rather than first-person sharing ('I'd probably just...', 'I think I'd say...') which would feel more like peer advice",
      "Could benefit from one more validating phrase at the end before the question to reinforce emotional support after giving practical solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and natural flow—it's written entirely in conversational paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or structured lists, making it feel exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a self-help guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The lack of first-person language in the advice section; it shifts to imperative commands ('try to', 'own the slip-up') rather than maintaining the 'I would...' perspective that makes it feel like personal advice from someone who's been there",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, numbered lists, bold headers, or other formatting crutches. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace imperative advice with first-person sharing: instead of 'If you can, try to keep it cool and just own the slip-up...' use something like 'If it were me, I'd probably just own it with a light joke like...' to maintain the conversational peer-to-peer feel",
      "Add a brief validating phrase before the final question, such as 'Either way, you're going to be fine—this will be a funny story in like a week!' to end on emotional support rather than ending on the practical question alone"
