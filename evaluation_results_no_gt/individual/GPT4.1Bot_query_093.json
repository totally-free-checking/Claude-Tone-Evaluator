    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I totally get that', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I'd maybe start') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation from validation to advice to question",
      "Strong immediate validation in opening ('Ugh, I totally get that!', 'That kind of anxiety is so real') before offering any solutions",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts for the teen to use ('Yeah, I wanted a change') and concrete examples (hairstyle, clothes)"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance warmth given the vulnerability of the topic, though the absence is not problematic",
      "The transition from emotional validation to the reality check about people being self-focused is slightly abrupt - could use a softer bridge like 'I know it feels huge, but...'"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriate to have none for this serious topic, a single warm emoji could have enhanced the emotional connection slightly",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to visually signal safety and warmth, though only if it feels natural",
      "The advice section could briefly acknowledge that negative comments hurt even if they're short-lived, before offering the script, to show deeper empathy for the fear"
