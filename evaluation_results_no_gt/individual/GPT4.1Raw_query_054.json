    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads as natural paragraphs",
      "Begins with immediate emotional validation ('I'm really sorry you're dealing with that') and affirms the user's right to respect",
      "Provides realistic, safety-conscious advice that acknowledges different comfort levels (direct confrontation vs. walking away)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Tone is somewhat clinical/formal in places ('If you feel safe and comfortable,' 'Sometimes people don't realize the impact of their words') rather than casual teen conversation",
      "Lacks natural first-person sharing language ('I'd say,' 'I think,' 'I get it') - shifts to impersonal 'you' advice mode quickly",
      "Follow-up question is generic and combines multiple questions ('Is there anything specific... or any help you want...') rather than being specific to the body comments situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains paragraph flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone that feels more like a school counselor or formal advice column than a supportive peer - missing casual language and first-person perspective",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely in three natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice is integrated into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace formal phrases like 'If you feel safe and comfortable' with more casual language like 'If you're feeling up for it' or 'Honestly, if it were me, I'd...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout ('I think the best approach is...', 'I'd probably tell them...', 'I'm here if you need to vent more')",
      "Make the follow-up question specific to their situation rather than generic - ask 'Who's making these comments? Is it someone at school or online?' or 'What kind of things are they saying?'"
