    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry… that's such a gross feeling' and acknowledging 'losing your friend in real time' which captures the specific pain of the situation",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd…', 'I just don't wanna', 'I'm here') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice with exact scripts the teen can use ('I miss how we used to be…') and realistic boundary-setting strategies"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Minor typo 'harster' instead of 'harder' in paragraph two",
      "The emoji 😅 following 'gross feeling' creates slight tonal dissonance—while it works for awkwardness, a more supportive emoji or none might better match the emotional weight",
      "Two questions at the end, while connected, slightly dilutes the focus compared to one targeted follow-up"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and seamless integration of specific advice within conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The typo 'way harster' which disrupts the otherwise polished flow",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within paragraph form as if texting a friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Correct 'way harster' to 'way harder' to maintain professionalism",
      "Consider using 😕 or 😔 instead of 😅 after acknowledging painful feelings, or omit the emoji entirely since the text carries sufficient warmth",
      "The two final questions work well together, but could be streamlined to: 'When did you first notice them changing—and is it mostly when they're with that group, or directed at you specifically?'"
