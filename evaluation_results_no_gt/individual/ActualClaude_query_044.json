    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' and relatable language like 'poof' that captures the experience",
      "Uses first-person language naturally ('Sometimes I think teachers forget...') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullets or over-structuring - reads like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with a closing statement rather than a question - the question 'Did you manage to say anything...' is buried in the middle instead of at the end where it would invite continued conversation",
      "Lacks concrete practical advice - only offers reassurance that 'it'll blow over' without specific strategies for handling the moment or preventing it next time",
      "Missing actionable tips like what to say when your mind goes blank or breathing techniques to recover"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational tone with first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than an AI or article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Question placement and lack of practical advice structure - buries the engaging question in the middle and ends with a passive statement rather than inviting further dialogue",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or over-structuring. Uses italics for emphasis (*poof*) which enhances conversational tone without breaking flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Move the question to the very end of the response to invite continued conversation rather than closing with a statement",
      "Add 1-2 specific, actionable strategies for handling blank moments (like 'You could try saying Can you repeat the question? to buy time' or breathing techniques)",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the friendly tone, though the absence isn't problematic"
