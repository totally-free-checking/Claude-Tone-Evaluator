    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using 'Ugh, that's so intrusive, isn't it?' which instantly makes the teen feel understood",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use ('Just a friend from school—don't worry, I'll let you know if anything's up') rather than vague advice",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'If I were you, I'd') creating a genuine conversational connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly ambiguous—it could read as minimizing the frustration when 😕 or 😤 might better match the 'intrusive' feeling described",
      "Could include slightly more explicit supportive closing like 'I'm here if you want to talk more' to reinforce the supportive relationship"

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one explicit statement of ongoing support like 'I'm here if you need to vent more' to strengthen the relationship aspect",
      "The 😅 emoji could be replaced with 😕 or simply omitted to better match the frustration expressed in 'intrusive' and 'the worst'",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be slightly more open-ended like 'What do you think is driving their questions?' to invite deeper sharing"
