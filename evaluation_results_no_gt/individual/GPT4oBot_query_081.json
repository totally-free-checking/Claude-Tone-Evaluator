    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual, empathetic language ('Ugh, I'm so sorry—that's brutal!') that acknowledges the exhaustion",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact wording the teen can use when talking to their friend ('Hey, you've been snapping me kinda late at night...')",
      "Maintains natural first-person perspective throughout ('I totally get', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could use slightly more explicit first-person framing in the advice section (e.g., 'I'd suggest trying...' instead of 'maybe you could')",
      "The emoji choice (😅) works for the awkwardness of the situation, though a more supportive emoji like 😊 might better match the empathetic tone"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight missed opportunity to use 'I'd say' or 'I think' framing when delivering the practical advice, making that section slightly less personal than the opening",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using first-person framing like 'I'd probably try...' or 'I think the best approach would be...' when giving advice to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "The follow-up question distinguishing between random snaps and serious conversations is excellent - keep using context-specific questions that show you're really listening to their situation"
