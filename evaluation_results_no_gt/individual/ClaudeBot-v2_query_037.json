    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with visceral language like 'stomach-drop moment' and 'spiraly feeling' that perfectly captures the teen experience",
      "Natural first-person advice delivery using phrases like 'I'd probably focus' and 'I'm so sorry' creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Specific actionable scripts provided ('Hey, I overheard my name earlier...') that give teens exact words to use in a difficult confrontation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reframing 'it's not as deep as it feels' comes relatively quickly after validation and could potentially feel minimizing to some teens, though it is softened by 'Honestly'",
      "Lacks an explicit 'I'm here for you' or 'I get it' type statement that would further reinforce the first-person supportive presence"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting in conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The emoji choice (😅) slightly mismatches the anxiety-inducing 'stomach-drop' description, as it connotes embarrassment/awkwardness more than the hurt/anxiety of being talked about, though it is appropriately sparse",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using conditional language ('If it was someone you know...') rather than listed options."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more beat of pure emotional validation before the reframing to ensure the teen feels fully heard before moving to perspective-shifting",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of situational specificity in future responses to show genuine engagement with their unique circumstances"
