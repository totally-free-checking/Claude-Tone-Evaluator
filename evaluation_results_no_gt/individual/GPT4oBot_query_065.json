      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I've been trying', 'I don't really know') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts for the teen to use ('Oh, I don't really know anything about that, but did you see...' and 'I've been trying not to get into people's business lately')",

      "Consider combining the two final questions into one focused question like 'Do you think they'd be cool with you setting that boundary, or would it be better to just keep changing the subject?'",
      "The transition from validation to advice is good but could include one more empathetic phrase like 'That guilt of not wanting to participate but not wanting to call them out is the worst' before explaining the habit aspect"
