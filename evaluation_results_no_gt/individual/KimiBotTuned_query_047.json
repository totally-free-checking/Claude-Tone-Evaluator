      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' and acknowledging the specific feeling of being treated younger",

      "Lacks first-person 'I think' or 'I'd' statements in the advice section, using second-person 'you can' instead",

      "Consider using 😔 or 😕 instead of 😅 for frustration situations, or omit the emoji entirely, as 😅 implies nervousness rather than empathetic validation"
