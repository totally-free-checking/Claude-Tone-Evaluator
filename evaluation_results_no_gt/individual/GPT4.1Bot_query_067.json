      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so much pressure!' and 'I can totally get why that feels overwhelming' that mirrors the teen's stress",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try,' 'I swear,' 'I can totally get') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use with parents ('Can we talk about this in smaller bits? It's stressing me out')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance visual warmth, though the absence is acceptable for this stress level",
      "The phrase 'Already stressing you out before it even matters, right?' starts with a sentence fragment, which while conversational, slightly breaks flow"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized."

      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 after 'Ugh, that's so much pressure!' or 💙 at the end) to enhance warmth without being excessive",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be slightly more concise: 'Are they asking about specific schools/careers or just general future planning?' maintains the same meaning with fewer words"
