      "Immediate emotional validation with visceral language ('instant stomach-drop', 'brain sprinting through worst-case scenarios') that makes the teen feel truly seen",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word scripts the teen can actually text back ('Yeah, what's up? I'm kinda anxious now lol—are we okay?') rather than vague suggestions",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person framing in the advice section (uses 'it's totally fair to reply' rather than 'I'd suggest texting' or 'I think you could say')",
      "Missing a warm closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk' that would reinforce the supportive relationship"
