      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable language ('Ugh, that's the absolute worst', 'that panicky feeling is so real') that mirrors the teen's stress",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts the teen can literally copy-paste ('Hey, it's due tomorrow. What can you finish tonight by 9pm?...') including the exact wording for messaging the teacher",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs that read like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is technically compound (asking both about project type AND communication status), which slightly dilutes the engagement",

      "Consider simplifying the final question to one focused inquiry (e.g., 'What kind of project are you working on?') rather than the compound 'and' structure to make it feel more like a natural conversation turn",
      "Add one explicit first-person empathy statement like 'I've been there and it's so frustrating' to strengthen the personal connection before jumping into the 'I'd send' advice"
