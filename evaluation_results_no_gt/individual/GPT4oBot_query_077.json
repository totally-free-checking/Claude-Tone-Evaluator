    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally in three conversational paragraphs",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Oh wow, that's a tough spot to be in' and acknowledgment of the 'heavy responsibility'",
      "Perfect emoji usage with single 💙 placed early to set warm tone without being excessive",
      "Well-balanced structure that validates first, offers practical safety guidance, then re-engages"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd feel', 'I get it') which makes it feel slightly impersonal despite being warm - reads more like general wisdom than a specific person relating to them",
      "Could use more specific first-person connection like 'I'd be so torn in your situation' or 'I think you're handling this thoughtfully' to strengthen the supportive relationship"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads exactly like a supportive text message",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person 'I' statements that would create a stronger sense of personal connection and make it feel like a specific supportive individual rather than general advice",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "Add first-person perspective using 'I' statements like 'I think you're being a really thoughtful friend' or 'I'd feel so conflicted too' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider adding one specific phrase example they could use when talking to their friend or the adult, such as 'You could say something like...' to make the advice more actionable"
