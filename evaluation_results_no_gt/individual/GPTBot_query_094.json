      "Completely lacks conversational warmth - reads like a medical pamphlet with headers like '## First: make sure it's safe to treat at home' and '## Quick relief'",
      "Zero first-person language - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' to create personal connection",
      "Heavy use of bullet points, bold text, and headers instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Minimal emotional validation - only 'I'm sorry you're dealing with that' before jumping to clinical advice",
      "Overwhelming length and medical terminology (NSAIDs, thunderclap onset, bruxism) not suited for casual teen support context",

      "Rewrite entirely in 2-3 natural paragraphs without any headers or bullet points - flow the advice into sentences like 'I'd start by checking if you're hydrated...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout: 'I think you should...', 'I'd try...', 'I get headaches too when...'",
      "Move emotional validation to the forefront and sustain it: validate the stress before giving medical advice, acknowledge how much headaches suck when you're already stressed",
      "Replace the numbered clinical questions at the end with one natural follow-up like 'Where do you feel the pain most? And what's been stressing you out lately?'",
      "Cut length by 60% - teens need 2-3 concrete tips max, not a comprehensive medical guide"
