      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that would drive me nuts too!' and 'I totally get why that's bugging you' that mirrors the teen's frustration",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I totally get') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I've noticed you've been doing a lot of the same things as me lately, and sometimes it makes me feel a little weird. Can we talk about it?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) to enhance the casual tone, though the absence isn't problematic",

    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage is appropriate at zero, though adding one subtle emoji could enhance warmth slightly (this is a very minor nitpick as zero is acceptable)",

      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 after 'drive me nuts' or 💙 at the end) to enhance warmth, though the current tone is already warm",
      "Continue using first-person language ('I'd say', 'I think') exactly as done here—it creates crucial personal connection",
      "The specific conversation script provided is excellent—keep offering exact phrases teens can use when they're unsure what to say"
