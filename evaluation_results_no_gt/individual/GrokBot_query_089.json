      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'd say,' 'If I were you,' 'I totally get') creating authentic personal connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language ('Ugh,' 'world's closing in,' 'total avalanche') before offering solutions",

      "Maintain the strong first-person perspective ('I think,' 'I'd suggest') as it creates genuine connection and avoids sounding like a generic self-help article",
      "Consider replacing generalizations like 'Most people bounce back' with personal encouragement like 'I think you can bounce back' to maintain the conversational intimacy throughout"
