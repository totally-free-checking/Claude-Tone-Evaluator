    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Oh no! I'm so sorry' and vivid empathy ('crawl under your desk and hide forever') that captures the mortification perfectly",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout ('If I were you, I'd just try,' 'I promise,' 'We've all been there') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use ('ugh, my brain is clearly not awake yet!') rather than vague 'just laugh it off' advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one more explicit 'I get it' or 'I feel you' type statement in the middle section to maintain first-person connection through the reassurance paragraph",
      "The transition from 'your brain is making it out to be' to the advice could include a brief 'I know it's hard to hear this right now, but...' to soften the reality check"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with perfect conversational flow between validation, reassurance, and advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight opportunity for even more first-person 'I' statements in the second paragraph to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. The advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding an 'I totally get why you want to disappear right now' or similar first-person validation in the second paragraph to maintain the personal connection throughout",
      "The follow-up question is excellent, but you could make it even more engaging by adding 'I'm curious' or 'I'd love to know' before the question to emphasize genuine interest"
