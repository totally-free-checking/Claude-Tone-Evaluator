    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language to build connection ('I've totally had moments like that', 'I’d say') creating a peer-like supportive dynamic",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation with an older sibling",
      "Strong immediate validation ('Oh man, that's such an awkward spot to be in!') that names the specific emotion before offering advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The line 'this probably feels way bigger to you than it really is' risks minimizing the teen's anxiety by suggesting they're overreacting, even if well-intentioned",
      "Could offer slightly more specific guidance on what to do if the friend later asks 'did I tell you about...' or references the secret again"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no corporate structure or bullet points",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight minimization in 'feels way bigger than it really is' which could inadvertently dismiss the teen's valid anxiety about the social situation",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as three natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace 'this probably feels way bigger to you than it really is' with something like 'it's totally normal to feel like this is huge right now' to validate without minimizing",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I'm here to talk more about this if you need it' or similar closing alongside the question to reinforce ongoing support availability"
