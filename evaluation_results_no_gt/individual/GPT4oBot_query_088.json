    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's so awful' and 'You're totally right to feel upset' that acknowledge the hurt and injustice of the situation",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using specific scripts like 'Hey, earlier today someone made a racist/sexist comment...'",
      "Excellent balance between validating the teen's feelings and offering realistic, age-appropriate actions (talking to teacher or counselor) while acknowledging their comfort level"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses slightly impersonal framing like 'one option could be' rather than first-person language like 'I think you could' or 'I'd probably suggest'",
      "Ends with two questions ('How are you holding up? Do you feel like anyone else...') rather than one focused question, though they are natural and related"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with strong emotional validation - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no bullet points or over-structuring while immediately acknowledging the sickening feeling of the situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Lack of explicit first-person perspective in the advice section - uses detached phrasing like 'one option could be' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd say' when suggesting actions",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace impersonal advice framing like 'one option could be' with first-person language such as 'I think you could try' or 'I'd probably suggest' to make the advice feel more like it's coming from a supportive friend rather than a generic guide",
      "Consider condensing the final two questions into one flowing question or choosing the most engaging one, as multiple questions can feel slightly overwhelming even when well-intentioned"
