    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific, relatable language ('gross, stuck feeling like you're not being seen as your own person') that captures the exact emotion of sibling comparison",
      "Provides concrete, word-for-word scripts the teen can actually use ('When you compare me to them, it makes me feel like what I do doesn't count') rather than vague suggestions",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows naturally like a text conversation with a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language from the bot itself (missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it') - uses 'you could try' and 'sometimes it helps' instead of sharing personal stance",
      "The 😅 emoji placement after 'gross, stuck feeling' slightly mismatches the emotion (typically signals nervous laughter/awkwardness rather than the frustration/hurt of being compared)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with specific actionable scripts integrated seamlessly into paragraphs without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language usage - response avoids using 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' to share the bot's perspective, making it slightly less personal than ideal",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent - response is entirely in conversational paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective phrases like 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd say...' or 'I get how that feels' to make the response feel more like a personal conversation with a friend rather than general advice",
      "Consider either removing the 😅 emoji or replacing it with something more aligned with the hurt/frustration described (like 😔 or 💙) or simply relying on the strong empathetic language already present"
