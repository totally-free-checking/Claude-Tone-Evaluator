    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language ('Ugh, that \"calm down\" line is the worst, isn't it?') that mirrors the teen's frustration",
      "Excellent use of first-person perspective ('I've totally been there', 'If I were you, I'd try') creating genuine connection rather than detached advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable script ('Hey, I just need a minute to process this') that gives the teen exact words to use in the moment"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one supportive emoji to enhance visual warmth, though the absence is acceptable given the serious tone",
      "The follow-up question, while good, could be slightly more open-ended to invite deeper sharing beyond just the context"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriate to have none given the frustration topic, a single well-placed emoji could have added an extra layer of warmth",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as four natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, bold text, or structural formatting. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance warmth without undermining the validation",
      "The advice is strong but could include one alternative option for different contexts (e.g., what to do if you can't step away immediately)"
