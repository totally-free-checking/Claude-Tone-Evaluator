    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout, particularly 'If I were you, I'd...' which creates genuine connection and makes advice feel personal rather than prescriptive",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with that' and the relatable metaphor 'like your phone's on a treadmill you can't hop off'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs with specific scripts embedded in sentences"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question asks them to predict another person's reaction ('How do you think they'd react...') which can be anxiety-inducing; a question about their own feelings or hesitations would invite more vulnerable sharing",
      "Could benefit from slightly more explicit first-person framing in the advice section (e.g., 'I think starting with...' or 'I'd probably say...') to reinforce the supportive friend persona"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with embedded specific advice - it gives concrete scripts ('Hey, I really enjoy chatting...') without breaking into bullet points or lists, maintaining a texting-a-friend feel throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question focuses on predicting the other person's reaction rather than exploring the teen's own emotions or barriers, which slightly misses an opportunity for deeper emotional connection",

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Advice is seamlessly woven into conversational prose using phrases like 'If I were you, I'd start by...'"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider asking about their own feelings or fears rather than asking them to predict the texter's reaction - something like 'What's making you most nervous about sending that first boundary text?'",
      "Add one more 'I' statement in the advice section like 'I think the key is...' or 'I'd probably feel nervous too, but...' to strengthen the first-person supportive voice"
