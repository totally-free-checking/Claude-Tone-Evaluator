    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation using first-person language: 'I feel for you - we've all been there with unreliable group partners'",
      "Excellent practical advice that's immediately actionable and realistic for a teen's situation (documenting contact attempts, emailing professors, not doing double work)",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question: 'What kind of project is it? Maybe I can help you strategize how to tackle what's left!'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers (**Immediate damage control:**, **If they're MIA:**) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice sections - uses imperative/commands ('Reach out', 'Document', 'Do what you can') instead of 'I'd suggest...' or 'I think you should...'",
      "Advice-to-validation ratio is skewed heavily toward solutions due to the extensive bullet structure, making the emotional support feel like a brief intro rather than woven throughout"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question perfectly matches the ideal character - it's specific to their situation, naturally phrased, and invites continued conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is heavily structured with multiple bullet sections and bold headers, completely diverging from the natural prose paragraph style of a supportive friend texting",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses three distinct header sections with multiple bullets under each (**Immediate damage control:**, **If they're MIA:**, **For the presentation/submission:**). Only the opening and closing sentences are prose. This creates a checklist/wikiHow feel rather than conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs using first-person suggestions: 'I'd say reach out to your partner RIGHT NOW - call, text, whatever. Sometimes people just lose track of time...' instead of imperative bullet points",
      "Weave emotional validation throughout the advice rather than front-loading it: 'I know it's tempting to panic and try to do everything yourself, but honestly? Don't kill yourself trying to do two people's work overnight'",
      "Remove all bold headers and bullet formatting to create a flowing text message style that feels like a supportive friend talking through options with you"
