      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sucks so much' and the metaphor of being 'stuck in the middle of a storm you didn't ask for'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",
      "Specific, actionable advice realistic for teen agency (earplugs, playlists, writing notes) with important safety caveats"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) feels slightly mismatched for the serious topic of parental conflict; a heart or no emoji might better suit the emotional weight",
      "Could strengthen first-person connection by using explicit advisory phrases like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' rather than imperative instructions"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and complete absence of bullet points, perfectly matching the ideal texting-style character",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider replacing 😅 with 💙 or omitting the emoji entirely for this serious topic, as nervous laughter may feel slightly out of place for parental conflict",
      "Add first-person framing to suggestions, such as 'I'd probably try putting in earplugs' or 'I think writing a note might help' to sound more like personal advice",
      "Include an explicit supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to reinforce the first-person supportive presence"
