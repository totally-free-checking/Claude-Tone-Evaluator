      "Provides specific, actionable advice including an exact script the teen could use ('Sure, I'm available. Just so I can prepare, is there a particular topic you want to discuss?')",
      "Opens with immediate validation ('Totally understandable — that phrase can make anyone's stomach drop') acknowledging the physical anxiety response"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured formatting with numbered bullet points and bold headers (**Don't panic-spiral**, **Plan a response**, **Ground yourself**) instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Completely missing a follow-up question to continue the conversation - ends with a statement ('Hang in there') rather than inviting further dialogue",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal 'you could' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think', creating distance rather than connection"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality, specifically providing a concrete text script they can send to get more information before the conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose paragraphs - instead of '1. Don't panic-spiral... 2. Plan a response...', write something like 'I'd try not to panic-spiral first... And if you want to ease the tension, you could text back something like...'",
      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end such as 'Do you have any idea what it might be about, or is it coming totally out of nowhere?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout to build connection - use phrases like 'I get why that's terrifying,' 'I'd probably be freaking out too,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk through it after'",
      "Spend more time on emotional validation before jumping to solutions - sit with the anxiety for a sentence or two before offering the 'it doesn't always mean something bad' perspective"
