    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that really stings, doesn't it?' and 'gut-punch' that acknowledges the pain without dismissing it",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I think', 'I'd focus') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic conversation script ('Hey, I've noticed we only hang out when your other plans fall through') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition between discussing the specific friend and general advice about building other friendships could flow slightly more smoothly",
      "Could potentially acknowledge the difficulty of confronting the friend a bit more before offering the script suggestion"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The advice section, while excellent, slightly dominates over the emotional validation portion - could use one more sentence of pure validation before moving to solutions",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as three natural paragraphs with no headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using specific conversation scripts like the 'plans fall through' example - this is incredibly helpful for teens who don't know what to say",
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase after the advice section and before the question to rebalance toward emotional support",
      "The 💙 emoji placement is perfect - keep using 0-1 emojis in this natural, early-position way to set warmth without overdoing it"
