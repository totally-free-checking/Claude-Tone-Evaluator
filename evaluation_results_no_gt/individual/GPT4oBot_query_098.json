    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd say') creating genuine personal connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate validation that normalizes the situation ('It happens to so many people', 'doesn't make you a bad person') without dismissing the guilt"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could be slightly more specific—'stay genuine' and 'keep things chill' are good but vague without concrete examples of what that looks like in daily interactions",
      "Slight imbalance toward validation over solutions—advice section is shorter and less detailed compared to the emotional support portions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language that creates an authentic peer-to-peer connection rather than an advisory tone",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Specificity of practical advice—while the emotional guidance is excellent, the actionable steps ('take time to breathe', 'stay genuine') lack concrete examples of how to execute them in real social situations",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining conversational integrity throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific example of 'staying genuine'—for instance, 'like not pretending to like things you don't just to impress either of them'—to make the advice more actionable",
      "Could briefly acknowledge the specific guilt feeling ('that sinking feeling when you see both of them') before moving to the 'you're not a bad person' validation to show deeper emotional attunement"
