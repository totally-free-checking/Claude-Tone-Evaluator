    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and relatable phrasing like 'brain just left the chat' that captures the teen experience",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd try', 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice with exact scripts the teen can use ('Wait—can you repeat the question?', 'I'm stuck—could you come back to me?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense with multiple suggestions; could benefit from one more line break to improve mobile readability",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or bold text. Uses natural paragraph breaks that follow conversational logic (validation → normalization → advice → question)."

      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two smaller paragraphs after 'restart your brain' to improve readability on mobile devices",
      "Maintain the excellent first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say') as it creates strong rapport; avoid drifting into impersonal 'One should' or 'It is recommended' language"
