    "strengths": [
      "Ends with a natural, engaging question about how the friend usually asks (texting vs. in person), showing genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
      "Provides specific, realistic phrases the teen can actually use like 'I'm not sharing my homework anymore' and 'I can help you understand it, but I'm not giving you my answers'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers (###) instead of conversational prose - reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive text",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout almost the entire response (only uses 'I' in the final sentence), making it feel impersonal and instructional rather than like advice from a friend",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping to solutions - only 'That's annoying' before immediately moving to structured advice"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - ends with a specific, natural question about how the friend usually asks to copy homework",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the response is heavily structured with 5 header sections and extensive bullet lists rather than flowing conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 15,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response contains approximately 5 header sections (###) with extensive bullet lists under each. Only the opening sentence ('That's annoying...') and final paragraph are prose. The advice is delivered entirely through imperative bullet points rather than natural sentences."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd probably say something like...' or 'You could try telling them...' to make it feel like a conversation",
      "Add more emotional validation at the beginning using empathetic first-person statements like 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable position to be in' or 'I totally get why you're feeling drained by this' before offering solutions",
      "Reduce the number of specific script examples from 15+ bullets to 2-3 natural phrases woven into prose, as too many options can feel overwhelming"
