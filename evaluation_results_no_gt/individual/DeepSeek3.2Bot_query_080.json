    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable physical description ('makes your stomach do flips') that acknowledges the visceral anxiety of the situation",
      "Excellent use of first-person language for advice ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I know it's way easier said than done') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for immediate response ('Okay, sure. What's up?') rather than vague 'just communicate' advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reassurance that 'most of the time... turns out to be' less scary could potentially minimize the current anxiety before fully sitting with it, though it balances this with validation",
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for nervous relatability, might slightly mismatch the intensity of 'terrified' - a 💙 or 😊 might convey more direct warmth for the fear expressed"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and conversational flow that reads like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from validation to reassurance happens quickly - could spend one more sentence acknowledging how awful the waiting feels before moving to 'it might not be bad'",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific grounding technique for the anxiety spiral (like 'try naming 5 things you can see right now') before the conversation happens",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of contextual engagement in future responses"
