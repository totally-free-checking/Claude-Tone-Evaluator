      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text message",
      "Strong use of first-person language ('I'm really sorry','I'm here for you') and casual fillers ('Honestly') that create authentic conversational tone",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing a specific follow-up question to continue the conversation - ends with an invitation rather than an engaging question",
      "Lacks concrete, actionable advice beyond 'talk about it' - too heavy on validation without practical coping strategies or next steps",

      "Include one concrete, teen-appropriate coping strategy such as a specific grounding technique or a suggestion for who to talk to (friend, counselor, etc.)",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to enhance the emotional connection, or deepen the validation language with phrases like 'That sounds absolutely exhausting'"
