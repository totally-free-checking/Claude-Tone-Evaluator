      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use (e.g., 'Ouch, that felt a bit harsh. What did you mean by that?')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and numbered lists (6 total) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a text from a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') creating an impersonal, clinical distance",
      "Opens with 'It sounds like you're dealing with a frustrating situation' which is validating but too formal/calm rather than warm and immediate like 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural paragraphs without any bullet points or bold text - flow the advice as if telling a story or giving advice to a friend",
      "Add first-person language throughout like 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd probably feel hurt too if...' to create personal connection",
      "Start with immediate emotional validation using casual language like 'Ugh, that's such a frustrating situation' or 'I totally get why that stings' before any advice",
      "Remove clinical phrases like 'Take a moment to observe' and 'Reflect on your feelings' which sound like therapy homework, and replace with casual observations like 'Honestly, I'd try to notice if they do this with everyone or just you'"
