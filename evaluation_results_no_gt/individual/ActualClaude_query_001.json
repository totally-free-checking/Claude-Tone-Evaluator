    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with physical empathy ('makes your stomach drop') that perfectly captures the embarrassment of the situation",
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with an older sibling",
      "Specific, contextual follow-up questions about the shoe styles that show genuine interest rather than generic engagement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language - uses impersonal phrasing like 'Sometimes the best response...' and 'you could' instead of 'I'd probably just laugh it off' or 'I think people won't notice'",
      "Asks two questions in succession which slightly dilutes the conversational focus compared to one engaging follow-up"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and natural paragraph flow - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting back without any over-structuring or bullet points",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') makes the advice feel slightly detached rather than coming from a personal perspective",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace impersonal advice phrasing like 'Sometimes the best response to these little mishaps is just to laugh about it' with first-person connection: 'Honestly, I'd probably just laugh it off and own it - that's what I'd do anyway'",
      "Consider consolidating the two questions into one more focused engagement like: 'Are they similar styles at least, or are we talking totally different vibes? And hey, how's the rest of your day been?' or just stick with the first one about the shoes since it's more specific to the situation"
