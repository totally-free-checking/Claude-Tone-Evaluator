    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('That's really frustrating!') acknowledging the difficulty of the situation",
      "Uses contractions and casual language appropriate for teen conversation ('can't','really frustrating')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think','I'd be mad too', or 'I get it' makes it feel impersonal despite casual tone",
      "Too brief for the emotional weight of the situation - only 3 sentences before questions makes it feel slightly dismissive",
      "Asks two questions at once ('Do you know why...' and 'Want to talk about it more?') which can feel overwhelming rather than inviting one natural continuation"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or structured formatting. Text flows naturally as conversational paragraphs."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person empathetic statements like 'I'd be so annoyed if that happened to me' or 'I totally get why you're mad' to create personal connection",
      "Expand slightly with one concrete suggestion before asking questions, such as 'If you want to try to switch back, you could ask the teacher after class...'",
      "Consolidate the two questions into one engaging follow-up like 'What do you think prompted your teacher to move you?' to avoid interview-style questioning"
