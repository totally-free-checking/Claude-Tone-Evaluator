      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'My stomach would be in knots too' using first-person empathy that makes the teen feel truly understood",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with natural transitions between validation and advice",
