      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that sucks' and 'feels like a punch to the gut' that mirrors the teen's frustration",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I've definitely been there', 'If I were you, I'd try') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script ('I hear you, can we talk about what's bothering you?') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The normalization in paragraph two ('it usually feels way bigger in the moment than it actually is') could potentially be read as minimizing the teen's feelings, though intended to be reassuring",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji to enhance the supportive tone, though the absence is acceptable for this slightly tense topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - the response uses paragraph structure perfectly without any bullet points, headers, or over-formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight minimization in the second paragraph where it suggests the situation 'feels way bigger in the moment than it actually is' - while meant to be reassuring, it could slightly dismiss the teen's current emotional reality",

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining perfect conversational formatting throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the end of the first paragraph to enhance emotional connection, though the current tone works well without it",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of engagement in future responses",
      "The balance between validation and advice is strong - continue leading with empathy before offering solutions as done here with 'Ugh, that sucks' preceding the practical breath-taking advice"
