    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong follow-up questions that are specific to the situation ('Are you picking up on any particular signals...') and invite the teen to share more details",
      "Good balance between validating the uncertainty ('totally normal to feel unsure') and offering perspective ('everyone expresses interest differently')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel less like a personal conversation and more like general advice",
      "Missing emoji usage that could enhance warmth for this topic - a gentle 😅 or 😊 would fit the 'exciting and nerve-wracking' sentiment",
      "Could open with stronger emotional validation like 'Ugh, that uncertainty is the worst!' rather than the slightly detached 'Ah, the classic...'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language and personal connection - uses general statements rather than 'I' statements that would make it feel like a supportive friend talking",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: instead of 'It's totally normal to feel unsure,' try 'I totally get that - I've been there and it's so confusing when you can't tell if they like you back.'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 😊) to match the 'exciting and nerve-wracking' energy of the situation",
      "Open with slightly more empathetic validation before the 'classic situation' framing - acknowledge the emotional weight first, then normalize it"
