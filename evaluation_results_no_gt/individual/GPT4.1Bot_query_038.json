      "Excellent first-person language throughout that creates genuine connection ('I totally get that', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I promise you're not alone')",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation that normalizes the experience ('Most people are kind of faking it and second-guessing their choices too')",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji usage when one might enhance the warm, supportive tone (though zero is acceptable)",
      "The 'flipping a coin' advice, while practical, could potentially feel dismissive to some teens, though it's framed thoughtfully here"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses 'I' statements naturally throughout ('I'd look at', 'I feel', 'If I were you') creating an authentic peer-like connection rather than impersonal advice-giving",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - completely absent when one well-placed emoji (like 😅 or 💙) could enhance the warmth, though the absence doesn't significantly detract from the response",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or lists. Uses natural paragraph flow with conversational transitions ('Honestly', 'If I were you'). No headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Reads exactly like a supportive text message from a friend."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to visually signal friendliness, though this is optional",
      "The response is exemplary overall - maintain this level of first-person language and natural prose in future responses"
