    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific physical description ('your chest gets tight') that shows deep empathy for the teen's anxiety",
      "Excellent use of first-person conditional advice ('If I were you, I'd tell them...') that creates a supportive peer-like connection rather than distant instruction",
      "Provides concrete, realistic scripts the teen can actually use word-for-word when talking to parents, including the strategic framing of presenting a solution alongside the problem"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji (😅) at the end of the first paragraph, while only one, might slightly undercut the seriousness of the fear for some teens who are genuinely terrified rather than just nervous",
      "Could briefly acknowledge safety planning for teens with particularly harsh parents before asking about typical parental reactions"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose flow and conversational first-person voice that reads exactly like a supportive older sibling texting advice, with zero bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The placement of the emoji immediately after describing the heavy chest feeling, which could potentially minimize the emotional weight for a teen experiencing genuine panic about parental reaction",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider moving the emoji earlier or omitting it when describing intense physical anxiety symptoms to avoid minimizing the teen's fear",
      "Add a brief validating statement acknowledging that some parents do react poorly and that the teen's safety/comfort matters most, before asking about typical parental reactions"
