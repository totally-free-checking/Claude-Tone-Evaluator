    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that really sucks') and acknowledges the draining nature of the situation",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I get how draining that can feel') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use verbatim ('Hey, love hearing from you, but 2 am is kinda brutal for me...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji could potentially minimize the frustration slightly, though it generally works to lighten the tone",
      "Could briefly acknowledge why the friend might be texting late (anxiety, insomnia) before jumping to boundary-setting, though the 'most friends don't realize' line partially addresses this"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question, while good, is slightly narrower than ideal; it focuses only on the friend's reaction rather than opening space for the teen to share more about their feelings or the friendship dynamic",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using 'If I were you...' framing rather than imperative instructions."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more line of validation about how hard it is to set boundaries with friends before offering the script, to further emphasize that their exhaustion is valid",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more open-ended like 'How are you feeling about bringing this up with them?' to invite emotional processing alongside logistical planning"
