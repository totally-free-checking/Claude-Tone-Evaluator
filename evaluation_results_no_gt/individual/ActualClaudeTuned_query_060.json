      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so rough!' and acknowledgment of the awkward tension",

      "Could provide a specific script or example of what to say when talking to the friend about the situation",

      "Consider adding a specific conversation starter script for approaching the friend (e.g., 'Hey, I get the vibe your parents aren't my biggest fan...')",
      "Could validate additional emotions beyond awkwardness (like hurt or frustration) to show deeper emotional recognition"
