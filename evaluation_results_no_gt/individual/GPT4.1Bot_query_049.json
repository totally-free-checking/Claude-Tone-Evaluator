      "Excellent immediate validation with first-person empathy: 'Oh wow, I totally get that rush' and 'I totally get that rush—your brain just goes a million miles a minute, right?'",
      "Natural use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd just try...', 'I totally get') creating authentic connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points—reads like a text from a supportive friend with natural paragraph flow",
      "Strong follow-up question that invites specifics: 'What’s the latest thing your brain keeps replaying? Like, was it eye contact, a little wave, or just the smile?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reality check 'it's just a smile' could potentially feel slightly minimizing despite the parenthetical save, though the surrounding context mitigates this well",
      "Advice could include one specific conversation starter script rather than just 'say hey' to make it even more actionable for an anxious teen"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language ('I totally get', 'If I were you') that creates genuine peer-like connection without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice, while realistic, could offer slightly more specific scripting for the 'say hey' suggestion to reduce ambiguity for an overthinking teen",

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining conversational rhythm throughout."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific conversation starter example after 'say hey' (like 'Hey [name], how's your day going?') to give overthinkers a concrete script to reduce anxiety",
      "The transition from validation to advice is smooth, but you could add one more validating phrase after 'it's just a smile' to ensure the teen doesn't feel dismissed before moving to the reality check"
