      "Immediate emotional validation with 'That's the worst feeling' - acknowledges the unfairness and frustration right away",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - missing 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I'm here' that creates personal connection",
      "No practical advice offered - only invites venting without any actionable suggestions for handling the situation",

      "Add first-person language to create connection: 'I'd be so upset if that happened to me' or 'I think that's one of the most frustrating feelings'",
      "Expand to 2-3 paragraphs by offering one concrete suggestion (like talking to the teacher/parent with specific phrasing) before asking the follow-up question",
      "Move the question to the very end to encourage continued conversation: 'Want to talk about what happened?' should be the closing line"
