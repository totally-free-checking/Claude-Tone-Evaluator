    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - advice flows conversationally in paragraphs like 'If I were you, I'd first try to keep your cool...'",
      "Strong teen-appropriate language throughout including 'Ugh,' 'that really sucks,' 'feed the drama,' and 'what's the vibe' which creates authentic connection",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('I'm not into gossip') and realistic steps like talking to trusted teachers or leaning on supportive friends"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) may not match the emotional weight of rumors - the 'sweat smile' can feel minimizing or too casual for a genuinely painful situation",
      "Lacks explicit first-person emotional validation phrases like 'I get it' or 'I'm here for you' before jumping to the 'If I were you' advice section",
      "The line 'it usually blows up more in our heads than it does in reality' could feel dismissive to someone experiencing active social harm from rumors"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and structured lists while weaving practical advice into natural sentences",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while sparing (only one), the 😅 choice is questionable for a serious emotional situation and doesn't enhance warmth as effectively as other options or no emoji",

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with natural transitions between validation, normalization, advice, and engagement. No headers, bold text, or list formatting detected."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace 😅 with a more supportive emoji like 💙 or 😔 for serious situations, or omit entirely if unsure about tone",
      "Add explicit first-person validation before advice, such as 'I really get how much that hurts' or 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with this' to strengthen emotional connection",
      "Consider removing or softening the minimizing language about rumors 'blowing up more in our heads' which could invalidate the teen's very real social concerns"
