      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd pause', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice tailored to school context (retracing exact order: last class, hallway, bathroom, cafeteria, locker, bus drop-off)"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to reassurance ('it usually turns up') could be slightly more gradual, though still effective",

      "The specific examples of locations (locker, bus drop-off, cafeteria) are excellent - continue tailoring advice to specific teen contexts like this"
