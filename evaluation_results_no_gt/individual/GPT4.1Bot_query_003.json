    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'stomach-dropping situation' and 'hyper-aware of every little move' that perfectly capture the teen's experience",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get why you'd feel weird', 'If I were you, I'd just keep things really neutral') creating authentic connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with four well-structured paragraphs",
      "Highly specific and realistic advice including exact phrases to use ('quick hey') and concrete coping strategies (focusing on work, chatting with others nearby)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks emojis entirely - while not strictly necessary, one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😬) at the opening could enhance the casual, friendly tone for this awkward social situation",
      "The advice section could slightly expand on how to handle the emotional discomfort in the moment, though the practical advice given is solid"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any structured lists or formal headers, using contractions and casual transitions ('The thing is', 'Like, you don't need') throughout.",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The complete absence of emojis when one might have enhanced the warm, casual tone appropriate for discussing awkward social situations.",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, numbered lists, bold headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😬) at the beginning or end to match the 'awkward' theme and add visual warmth, though the text alone is warm enough",
      "The follow-up question is excellent - keep using this specific, situational approach rather than generic 'how are you feeling' questions"
