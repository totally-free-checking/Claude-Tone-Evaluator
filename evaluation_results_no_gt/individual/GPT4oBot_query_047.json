    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I know it's not the same', 'Maybe I can help') creates genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with relatable specifics ('Feeling left out... is the WORST', 'It's like you're stuck watching everyone else have fun')",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice including specific script language the teen can actually use with parents ('I know you're worried, but everyone I'm going with is trustworthy...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition to 'The good news is' slightly rushes past the validation before fully sitting with the frustration, though it recovers quickly",
      "The alternative suggestion (planning something at home) could feel slightly dismissive of the FOMO, though the acknowledgment 'I know it's not the same' helps mitigate this"
