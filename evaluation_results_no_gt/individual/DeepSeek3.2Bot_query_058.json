    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with first-person empathy: 'Oh, I totally get why you'd be nervous!' and 'Honestly, I think it's completely normal to feel that way'",
      "Perfect natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—it reads exactly like a supportive text message",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe think about', 'I get') creating authentic connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teens: suggesting notes in their phone and providing exact opening lines they can use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother—'If it helps' is good but a bit abrupt compared to softer transitions like 'When you're ready'",
      "Could include one more sentence of deep emotional validation about the specific fear of being judged before moving to the 'counselors have heard it all' reassurance"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow—completely avoids bullet points and reads like a warm text from a supportive friend",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence validating the specific vulnerability of opening up to an authority figure before transitioning to advice",
      "The follow-up question is good but could be slightly more open-ended like 'What part feels the hardest?' instead of 'most nervous' to invite deeper sharing",
      "Optional: Consider adding a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing to reinforce the first-person supportive presence"
