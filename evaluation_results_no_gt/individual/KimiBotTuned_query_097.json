      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ughhh that's such an awkward spot to be in' that captures the teen's discomfort",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",

      "Lacks explicit first-person framing statements like 'I think' or 'I'd say' when presenting advice, making it slightly less personal",
