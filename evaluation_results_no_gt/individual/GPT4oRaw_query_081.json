    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language that creates connection: 'I totally feel you on that' and 'I'll actually be awake' makes it feel like a real person texting",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including an exact script the teen could use: 'Hey, I love your snaps, but if you hit me up during the day, I'll actually be awake to appreciate them!'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - reads like a text conversation rather than an article"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - the response just stops after mentioning Do Not Disturb mode without inviting the teen to share more",
      "Could deepen emotional validation slightly by specifically acknowledging the exhaustion mentioned in the query ('exhausted') rather than just 'rough'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The conversational tone and first-person language usage - it genuinely sounds like a supportive friend texting with natural phrases like 'Ugh' and 'game changer'",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of any follow-up question to continue the conversation - it ends abruptly with practical advice rather than engaging the teen to share more about their situation or feelings",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with two natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. The advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a follow-up question at the end to invite continued conversation, such as 'Do you think your friend would be understanding if you mentioned it, or are you worried about hurting their feelings?'",
      "Consider acknowledging the specific word 'exhausted' from their query to validate the physical toll, not just the social awkwardness - something like 'Being woken up at 2am when you're already exhausted is the worst'"
