    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's seriously overwhelming' and acknowledging the trapped feeling between politeness and needing space",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout: 'I think,' 'If I were in your shoes, I'd,' and 'I get a little overwhelmed' creates authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, sorry if I don't reply super fast! I get a little overwhelmed...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one brief validating phrase right before the final question to bridge the advice back to emotional support",
      "The transition from advice to question is slightly abrupt - a softener like 'Hope that helps!' could improve flow"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational first-person tone - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The final question, while good, could be slightly more connected to the emotional experience rather than just the logistical context",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural conversational paragraphs with no lists, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief emotional check-in right before the final question (e.g., 'How are you feeling about texting them back?') to reconnect after the practical advice",
      "The response is strong enough that adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the start could enhance the tone, though the current text-only approach is also appropriate for this boundary-setting topic"
