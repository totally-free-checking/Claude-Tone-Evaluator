    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's such a tough spot to be in' and acknowledging the 'nagging feeling' that eats at you",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I just want to check in') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, can I ask you something? I've been feeling a little confused about what you said the other day'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early on to enhance warmth, though the absence is acceptable for this serious topic",
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother - 'The good news is' feels a tiny bit generic compared to the rest of the natural language"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no lists, headers, or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor opportunity for enhanced warmth through strategic emoji usage or slightly more vivid emotional acknowledgment of how scary confrontation feels",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the start or end to enhance the friendly tone, though this is optional for serious topics",
      "The phrase 'The good news is' could be replaced with something more casual like 'Here's the thing though' or 'But honestly' to maintain the conversational vibe throughout",
      "Could briefly acknowledge that calling out a friend is scary to validate the courage required for this conversation"
