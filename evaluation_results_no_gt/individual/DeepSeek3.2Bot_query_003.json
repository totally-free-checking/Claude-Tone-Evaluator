    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'Ugh, that's so awkward' and 'weird mix of too much history and not enough to actually talk about'",
      "Excellent use of first-person perspective throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd probably') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice realistic for teen agency (nodding, focusing on phone/work) without suggesting impossible solutions"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question focuses on logistics ('What class') rather than deepening emotional connection or exploring the friendship dynamic",

      "Consider a follow-up question that invites emotional sharing like 'How are you feeling about having to see them every day?' rather than focusing on the class subject",
      "Add one sentence explicitly validating that losing a friend is hard/sad, not just awkward, to deepen the emotional support"
