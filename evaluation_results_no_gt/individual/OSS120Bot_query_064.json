    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with that' and 'It's totally understandable to be freaking out' that acknowledge the distress before offering solutions",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'we've all had that panic moment', 'our heads') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to a school environment (checking lockers, bathroom stalls, cafeteria tables, lost-and-found) rather than generic suggestions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched with the intensity of 'freaking out' - it reads as nervous laughter which may unintentionally minimize the distress rather than offering pure comfort",
      "The second paragraph slightly repeats the validation of the first ('most people have been in the same spot' vs 'we've all had that panic moment') without adding new emotional depth"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows conversationally within paragraphs ('check your locker, the bathroom stalls, any classrooms you were in') maintaining a texting-with-a-friend feel throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The emoji usage - while only one emoji is used (meeting the quantity guideline), the 😅 (grinning with sweat) choice is slightly tone-deaf for someone expressing genuine panic about losing something important, potentially reading as dismissive of their distress",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no headers, bold text, or bullet lists. Practical advice is naturally embedded in flowing sentences rather than formatted as a checklist"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider replacing 😅 with a more reassuring emoji like 😊 or 💙, or omitting it entirely when the user expresses significant distress, to avoid any perception of minimizing their panic",
      "Could incorporate more explicit first-person offers of support like 'I'm here to help you figure this out' or 'I'd start by checking...' to strengthen the personal connection even further"
