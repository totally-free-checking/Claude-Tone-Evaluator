    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I think', 'I'd maybe try') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with specific physical description ('That worry just sits in your stomach')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact script teen could use ('Hey, I wanted to check in...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "😅 emoji choice slightly mismatched for the serious emotional weight of feeling hated by a teacher (suggests nervous laughter rather than empathy)",
      "Could add one more sentence of validation before pivoting to 'teachers are busy' perspective to ensure feelings are fully heard first"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person language that sounds like a supportive older sibling texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection - 😅 (nervous sweat smile) undermines the seriousness of the emotional pain described",

      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace 😅 with 😊 or 💙 for serious emotional topics to better match the empathetic tone",
      "Add one more validating sentence before the 'sometimes teachers are just busy' reframing to ensure the teen feels fully heard before offering perspective",
      "Consider softening the transition to advice with something like 'If you want to try to figure this out...' to make it feel more optional"
