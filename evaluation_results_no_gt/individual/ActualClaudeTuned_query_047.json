    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'I totally get why that would make you feel left out or even embarrassed'",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I totally get') creating authentic personal connection",
      "Specific, realistic advice tailored to teen agency including concrete compromise strategies like hourly check-ins and earning privileges"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice slightly mismatches the emotional tone—it's typically used for nervous laughter or embarrassment rather than validating frustration",
      "The transition from validation to advice in paragraph 3, while practical, could use a slightly softer bridge phrase to maintain the emotional connection"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - the response flows as conversational paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, perfectly matching the ideal of texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection - while appropriately sparse (only one), the 😅 (grinning face with sweat) doesn't perfectly align with the frustration being validated and could inadvertently minimize the teen's feelings",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or bold formatting. Advice is integrated seamlessly into prose sentences rather than listed as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider replacing 😅 with 😩, 😤, or simply omitting the emoji to better match the validation of frustration rather than suggesting nervous laughter",
      "Add a brief transitional phrase like 'I'm wondering if you've tried...' or 'What if you approached it like this...' between the validation and advice sections to maintain the warm, collaborative tone"
