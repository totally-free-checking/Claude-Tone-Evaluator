      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's honestly the worst' and 'I totally get why you'd be annoyed'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd probably...', 'I hear you') creating authentic connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji usage when one might have enhanced the warm, casual tone (though the warmth comes through strongly in text alone)",
      "Could slightly deepen validation of the 'unfair' feeling mentioned before moving to normalization"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with zero formatting structure and authentic use of 'I' statements throughout",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullets, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 after 'Ugh, that's honestly the worst' or 💙 at the end) to enhance visual warmth without overdoing it",
      "The validation is strong, but could briefly acknowledge why it feels specifically unfair to be called out for 'attitude' before normalizing that it's common"
