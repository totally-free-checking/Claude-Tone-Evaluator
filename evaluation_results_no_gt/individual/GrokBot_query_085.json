      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sounds so draining and stressful' and 'walking on eggshells' language that perfectly captures the teen's experience",
      "Excellent use of first-person advice format ('If I were you, I'd start by...') that feels like a trusted friend sharing personal perspective",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, the constant arguing is kinda getting to me – can we all chill a little?'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen validation of the 'stuck' feeling specifically before moving to normalization",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more line validating the specific 'stuck' feeling (e.g., 'It sucks when you care about people but the drama is exhausting') before the normalization",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be made even more conversational by adding 'I'm curious' or 'I'm wondering' before it"
