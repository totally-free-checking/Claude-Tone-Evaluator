    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Oof, that's such a relatable moment!' and 'We've all been there' which acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for what to say to the teacher: 'I'm really sorry, I completely forgot about this assignment. Could I turn it in tomorrow with a late penalty?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers (**Be honest:**, **Ask about options:**, **Learn from it:**) which function as bullet points rather than flowing prose",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal despite casual word choice"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - uses exactly one appropriate emoji (😅) early in the response to set a warm, relatable tone without being excessive",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - relies on bold headers and colons to structure advice into three distinct sections rather than weaving suggestions into natural conversational paragraphs",

      "notes": "Response uses three bold-header sections (**Be honest:**, **Ask about options:**, **Learn from it:**) which are functionally bullet points. The advice is listed rather than narrated, reading more like a wikiHow article than a text from a supportive friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the structured advice into flowing prose by using first-person framing: 'Honestly, I'd just be upfront with them. Most teachers appreciate honesty, so you could say something like...' instead of bold headers",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I get that sinking feeling too' to create the sense of talking with a supportive friend rather than receiving generic advice",
      "Change the follow-up question timing from past tense ('How did it go') to present/future ('How are you planning to handle it?' or 'Are you going to talk to them after class?') since the situation is likely ongoing"
