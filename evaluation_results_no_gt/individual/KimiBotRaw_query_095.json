      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I need you to stop saying that. I'm not laughing...')",
      "Ends with a contextual follow-up question that shows genuine interest in their specific situation (work vs. social circle)",
      "Takes the safety concern seriously with realistic, age-appropriate steps like documenting incidents and telling a counselor"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses heavy bullet-point formatting with bold headers (**Set a hard boundary**, **Document it**) instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - reads like an instructional guide rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Jumps quickly to solutions after only one sentence of validation, creating an imbalanced feel"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic steps specific to the situation including exact phrases to use and documentation strategies",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - uses 'Here's what you can do:' followed by four structured bullet sections with bold headers, which feels like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as natural paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd suggest setting a hard boundary next time...' or 'I think you should document this by...' instead of bullet headers",
      "Add more emotional validation upfront before giving advice - acknowledge how scary or stressful this must feel with phrases like 'That sounds really intimidating' or 'I get why that would make you anxious'",
      "Remove bold formatting and bullet points entirely; flow the advice naturally within conversational sentences as if texting a friend"
