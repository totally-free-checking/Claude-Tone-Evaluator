    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, such as 'If I were in your shoes' and 'I get why you'd be craving,' creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with opening 'Ugh, that's such a tricky spot' and acknowledging feeling 'totally suffocated' and 'exhausting'",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for setting boundaries: 'Hey, I love hanging out, but I need a little bit of downtime right now—can we catch up later?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance warmth, though the text-only approach is appropriate and mature for this specific topic",
      "The follow-up question is slightly compound (asking two things at once), though it flows naturally as an either/or question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational first-person language that makes the advice feel like it's coming from a supportive peer rather than an authority figure",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of emoji when one gentle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) could have added visual warmth to match the verbal warmth, though this is a minor consideration given the topic",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no formatting structures, headers, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized, maintaining conversational rhythm throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance visual warmth, though the text-only approach works well for this serious topic",
      "The compound question at the end works conversationally, but could be simplified to a single focus question like 'What's holding you back from taking that space?' for slightly cleaner engagement"
