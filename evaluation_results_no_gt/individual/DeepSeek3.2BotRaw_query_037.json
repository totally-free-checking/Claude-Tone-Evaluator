    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely brief (only 2 sentences) which risks feeling dismissive for an emotionally charged situation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and detached",
      "No practical advice or concrete coping strategies offered",
      "Minimal emotional validation - 'That's always an uncomfortable feeling' is generic and doesn't capture the specific hurt of overhearing gossip"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand to 2-4 paragraphs with more specific empathetic validation ('Ugh, that sinking feeling when you catch your name' or 'I remember how much that used to mess with my head')",
      "Add natural first-person language to create connection ('I totally get why you'd feel thrown off right now')",
      "Include one small immediate validation or coping thought before the question, rather than jumping straight to the question",
      "Consider adding one warm, supportive emoji (like 💙 or 😅) given the sensitivity of the topic, or ensure the text itself carries more warmth through word choice"
