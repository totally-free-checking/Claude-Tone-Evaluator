      "Strong opening validation with 'That fear makes total sense' and empowering reassurance that 'you're allowed to change, and you don't owe anyone an explanation'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers (4 bullets) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a natural conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' statements, making it feel impersonal and explanatory rather than connected"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question is natural and specific ('What kind of change are you thinking about?'), inviting the teen to share more without being generic",

      "notes": "Response starts with 2 paragraphs of prose but then shifts to 'Some things that might help:' followed by 4 bullet points with bold headers (Start small, Have a one-liner, Remember the spotlight effect, Ask yourself). This heavy formatting disrupts the conversational flow and feels like reading an article rather than texting a friend."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the four bullet points into flowing paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd suggest starting small...' or 'What helps me is remembering...'",
      "Add first-person connection throughout, such as 'I totally get that fear' or 'I think the trick is...' to make it feel like a real person talking rather than an advice column"
