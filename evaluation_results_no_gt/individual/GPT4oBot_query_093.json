    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ahhh, I get that—that fear... is *so real*' combined with acknowledging the vulnerability of the situation",
      "Perfect emoji usage with single 💙 placed naturally at the end of the first paragraph to enhance warmth without being excessive",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Limited first-person language beyond the opening 'I get that' - could benefit from more 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' phrasing throughout the advice sections to feel more personally connected",
      "Could validate the specific fear of negative judgment for a moment longer before pivoting to reassurance that most people don't care"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Incorporate more first-person phrases like 'I think you should...' or 'I'd probably start with...' when giving advice to strengthen the personal, supportive connection",
      "Consider spending one more sentence acknowledging the specific worry about negative comments before pivoting to reassurance, to ensure the teen feels fully heard in their fear"
