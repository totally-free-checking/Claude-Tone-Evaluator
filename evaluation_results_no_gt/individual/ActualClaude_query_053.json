    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and acknowledging the specific pain of mental preparation being wasted",
      "Excellent follow-up question at the end that feels natural and invites continuation ('Have you thought about talking to them about it directly...')",
      "Uses casual, relatable language like 'flakey' and validates the user's worth with 'your time matters too'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a 3-item bullet list for questions instead of natural prose flow, making it feel like a survey rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes the response feel impersonal despite being casual",
      "The bullet questions interrupt the conversational flow that was established in the opening paragraph"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - immediately acknowledges the frustration with empathetic language and validates that the user's time and feelings matter",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - the response relies on a structured bullet list for questions instead of maintaining conversational paragraph flow throughout",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "75%",
      "notes": "Response contains one distinct bullet list with three questions in the middle section. The bullets break the conversational flow and feel like an interrogation rather than natural dialogue. The remaining content is prose, but the bullet section is prominent enough to feel structured."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet-point questions into natural prose sentences or integrate them conversationally (e.g., 'I'm wondering if they usually give a reason when they cancel, or if this is something new?')",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - instead of 'A few questions that might help,' try 'I'd want to figure out a few things first,' or instead of 'Sometimes people don't realize,' try 'I think sometimes people don't realize'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the opening (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the supportive tone, though the absence isn't critical"
