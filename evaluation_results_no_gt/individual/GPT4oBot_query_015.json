    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, such as 'I'm really sorry,' 'I totally get,' and 'I'd try,' creating a personal, supportive connection that feels like texting with a friend",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points or headers, allowing advice to flow naturally in conversational paragraphs rather than structured lists",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for confronting the sibling ('Hey, I've noticed you keep going through my stuff...') and offers multiple realistic backup options (parents, locking things away)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'crossing this boundary' is slightly more formal/clinical than the rest of the casual, conversational tone",
      "The transition from emotional validation to practical advice in paragraph 3 could be slightly more gradual, though the 'Honestly' and 'I bet' help soften the shift"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with consistent first-person language ('I totally get,' 'I'd try,' 'I bet,' 'I know') makes it feel like a supportive older sibling or friend texting rather than an automated or clinical response",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "While the follow-up question is specific to the situation, it leans slightly toward a yes/no structure with 'do you feel like they'd listen' rather than being fully open-ended, though it still invites elaboration",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice is seamlessly woven into conversational prose rather than being listed out"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more brief validating phrase between the normalization ('this is such a common sibling battle') and the practical advice to create an even smoother emotional bridge",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more open-ended (e.g., 'How do you think they'd react if you talked to them about it?') to invite more detailed sharing rather than focusing on whether they'd listen"
