    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that really hurts' and 'I totally get how that could make you feel unsafe' creates instant connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs like 'If you feel safe doing so, you could try a calm but firm line like...'",
      "Provides specific, actionable script ('Hey, I'm not cool with those comments. Please stop.') that a teen can actually use"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could use more first-person language in the advice section (uses 'you could try' rather than 'I'd suggest' or 'I think')",

      "Add first-person framing to advice section (e.g., 'I'd probably try saying...' or 'I think the best approach might be...') to maintain personal connection",
