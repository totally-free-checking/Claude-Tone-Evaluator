    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I totally get that' and 'such a tough spot to be in' that acknowledges the specific emotional conflict",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for quitting ('This has been a great experience, but I need to step back...') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses second-person 'you could try' rather than first-person 'I'd suggest' or 'I think,' making it slightly less personal",
      "The validation 'most people will respect your decision' is somewhat generic and could be more specific to teen social dynamics"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - maintains conversational flow throughout with smooth transitions between validation, advice, and engagement",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language in advice-giving section - uses 'you could' instead of 'I'd say' or 'I think,' making the practical suggestions feel slightly more detached than the warm validation",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no formatting, no headers, no bold text, and no lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Incorporate first-person perspective into the advice section by using phrases like 'I'd suggest saying...' or 'I think the best approach is...' to match the warm 'I totally get that' opening",
      "Consider combining the final two questions into one flowing question or ensuring they feel like a natural continuation rather than a checklist, though the current phrasing 'if you don't mind sharing' softens this nicely"
