    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific actionable advice with the 'safe schedule' template (1 English, 1 math, etc.) that gives concrete direction",
      "Ends with a targeted question about what specifically is making them feel behind, showing interest in the emotional root",
      "Uses relatable casual language like 'weirdly high-stakes' and 'totally normal' that acknowledges the social pressure"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - reads like an impersonal guide rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Heavy over-structuring with headers (###), numbered lists (5 questions), and bullet points instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Asks for 5 specific pieces of information at once which feels overwhelming and interview-like rather than conversational",
      "Jumps quickly from brief validation into tactical problem-solving without lingering on the emotional 'behind' feeling"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - the specific 'safe schedule' breakdown and recognition of different school systems shows deep understanding of teen academic planning",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting - it uses heavy markdown structuring with headers, numbered lists, and bullet points instead of conversational paragraphs, making it feel like a wiki article rather than a text from a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 11,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 3 section headers (###), 1 numbered list with 5 items, and 1 bulleted list with 6 items. Only 2 short paragraphs at the beginning are true prose. The rest is heavily formatted lists and headers which breaks conversational flow"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural paragraphs without headers or bullet points - integrate the 5 questions into flowing text like 'I'd love to know what grade you're going into and if you have any required classes...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout like 'I think you're probably not as behind as you feel' or 'I'd suggest starting with...' to create personal connection",
      "Reduce the information ask - instead of demanding 5 specific data points, ask 1-2 open questions naturally within the conversation flow",
      "Spend more time validating the 'behind' feeling before jumping to the 'Quick reset' solutions - acknowledge how stressful it is to compare yourself to friends who seem to have it figured out"
