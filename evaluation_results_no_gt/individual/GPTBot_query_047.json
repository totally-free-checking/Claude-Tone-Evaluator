    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation ('That really sucks') and acknowledges the feeling of being left out",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I get why you'd worry. Here's the plan...')",
      "The follow-up request for specific details (age, location, parent's reasoning) shows genuine interest in tailoring further help"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with 29+ bullet points and numbered headers (### 1, ### 2) instead of conversational prose",
      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses 'you should' and 'here are ways' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd try'",
      "Validation lasts only one sentence before jumping to analysis ('Usually when parents say no...') and extensive problem-solving",
      "Reads like an instruction manual or wiki article rather than a supportive text conversation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality is excellent - it provides realistic, teen-specific strategies with concrete phrases they can actually say to parents",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is completely misaligned with the ideal character - it uses heavy markdown structure (headers, numbered lists, bullet points) instead of natural prose paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 29,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses headers (###), numbered lists (1-5), and extensive bullet points throughout. Only the opening and closing contain prose paragraphs. The advice is delivered as a structured manual rather than a flowing conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the numbered steps into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of '### 1) Find out the real reason' write something like 'I'd start by figuring out what they're actually worried about. Maybe pick a calm moment and just ask...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout - use 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'In my experience' to sound like a real person sharing advice rather than an instruction manual",
      "Lead with 2-3 sentences of emotional validation before offering any solutions - sit with the feeling of unfairness before jumping to the 'how to fix it'",
      "Shorten significantly by removing sub-bullets and combining ideas - teens reading on phones will be overwhelmed by this length and structure",
      "End with a single natural question rather than a bulleted list of information requests - instead of 'If you tell me: - your age...' try 'How old are you, and what kind of thing are you trying to go to? I might be able to help you draft a text to them.'"
