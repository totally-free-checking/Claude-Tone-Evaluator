    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's the absolute worst' and acknowledging the 'awkward energy' that hangs in the air",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were in your shoes, I think I'd...', 'I think I'd just try to stay polite') creating a genuine, personal connection",
      "Natural conversational flow using casual teen-appropriate language ('weirdly intense', 'chill', 'their vibe') without sounding forced or corporate"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used to enhance warmth, though the textual warmth is strong enough that this is only a minor consideration",
      "The third paragraph containing practical advice is slightly dense at four sentences; breaking it into two shorter paragraphs could improve mobile readability"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language usage - consistently uses 'I think', 'I'd say', and 'If I were in your shoes' to sound like a supportive friend rather than an advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of emoji, though this is minor given the strong textual warmth and the awkward/serious nature of the topic",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose with zero bullet points, headers, or bold text. The response flows as continuous paragraphs exactly like a text conversation with a friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after 'hangs in the air, right?' to visually emphasize the awkwardness while maintaining the warm tone",
      "The advice paragraph could be split after 'respectful friend' to create more white space for easier phone reading, though the current flow is still very readable"
