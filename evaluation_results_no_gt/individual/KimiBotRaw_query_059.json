    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation with specific acknowledgment of the fear 'if I stopped reaching out, would anyone even notice?' and validating that 'that question stings'",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact phrases like 'hey, I love hearing from you first sometimes' and concrete concepts like the 'pause test'",
      "Strong metaphor of 'holding the door open' that captures the emotional labor vividly"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bulleted list with bold headers ('The pause test:', 'Low-key directness:') which breaks conversational flow and reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') making it feel observational rather than personally connected",
      "Opens with 'A few things that might help:' which signals a structured list approach rather than natural prose flow"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The emotional validation in the first two paragraphs perfectly captures the specific anxiety of being the initiator and validates the sting of feeling invisible",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting shifts abruptly into a structured bullet-point list with bold headers, which destroys the conversational intimacy established in the opening",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response starts with strong prose paragraphs but shifts to 'A few things that might help:' followed by 3 formatted bullets with bold headers and colons. This creates a jarring shift from conversational to instructional/article format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose paragraphs - instead of 'The pause test: Take a little breather...' write something like 'I'd suggest trying what I call a pause test - just take a little breather from being the starter...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout, such as 'I think the weird thing is...' or 'I'd say it's okay to...' to create that supportive friend-to-friend connection",
      "Remove the bold formatting and colons entirely - if you need to separate ideas, use natural transitions like 'Another thing I've noticed...' or 'You could also try...'"
