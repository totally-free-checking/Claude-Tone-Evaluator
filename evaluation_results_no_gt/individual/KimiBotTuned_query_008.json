    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Aw that's such a mix of exciting and stressful') that acknowledges both the excitement and anxiety of the situation",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts the teen can literally read to their parents, including specific phrases like 'I'm not trying to do anything sketchy' that address likely parental concerns",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Excellent follow-up question that categorizes parent types specifically ('tell us the plan and be safe' vs 'no parties, end of story') to continue the conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it' in the advice section - uses more impersonal phrasing like 'it can help to add' and 'you can say' rather than 'I'd recommend saying'",
      "Could include a more direct personal connection statement like 'I've been there' or 'I'm here to help you figure this out' to strengthen the supportive relationship"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow without any bullet points or structured lists - it reads like a genuine text conversation with a supportive older sibling",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of first-person perspective markers ('I think,' 'I'd say') in the advice portion makes it feel slightly instructional rather than like personal advice from a friend",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace impersonal constructions like 'it can help to add' with first-person advice like 'I'd suggest adding' or 'I think it helps to mention' to make it feel more like personal guidance from a friend",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I've totally been there' or similar personal acknowledgment to strengthen the 'we're in this together' feeling before diving into the practical script suggestions"
