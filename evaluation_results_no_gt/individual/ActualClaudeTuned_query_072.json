      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so rough!' and 'perfect storm of awkwardness' that normalizes the embarrassment",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I totally get,' 'If I were you, I'd,' 'I promise') creating authentic connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The pivot from validation to advice with 'Honestly though' could include one more sentence of empathy before reframing",

      "Add one more sentence of validation before the 'Honestly though' pivot to strengthen the emotional support",

      "Consider adding 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing support before the question to reinforce availability"
