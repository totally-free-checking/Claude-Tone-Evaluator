    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person inclusive language that creates connection ('I totally get that feeling', 'we're thinking', 'our look')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring",
      "Strong immediate validation in the opening sentence that normalizes the anxiety"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice about 'starting smaller' and 'testing the waters' is somewhat vague without specific examples of what that looks like",
      "Includes two follow-up questions which could feel slightly overwhelming; one strong question would be more focused",
      "Could benefit from one gentle emoji to add visual warmth to the appearance-related anxiety topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - maintains perfect conversational paragraph structure without any bullets, headers, or over-formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical specificity - while the advice to 'start smaller' is good direction, it lacks concrete examples (like 'try the outfit at home first' or 'test a temporary hair color') that would make the advice immediately actionable",

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with natural transitions. No bullet points, numbered lists, bold headers, or excessive formatting. Text flows naturally from validation to advice to questions."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific example of 'starting small' relevant to appearance changes (e.g., 'like trying a new hairstyle at home first before the public debut') to make the advice more concrete",
      "Either combine the two questions into one or choose the strongest one ('What kind of change are you thinking about?' is more engaging than the gut question)",
      "A single warm emoji like 😊 or 💙 after the first sentence could enhance the supportive tone for this anxiety-inducing topic without feeling excessive"
