    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('I've totally had nights where my mind just spins', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'I'm here to listen')",
      "Perfect prose format with natural conversational flow - no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting, reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation starting with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling' and normalizing the experience without dismissing it"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice paragraph has a slightly list-like rhythm with multiple 'or' options that could flow more organically (though still remains prose)",
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😅) to enhance warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the anxiety topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational tone with consistent first-person perspective - uses 'I' statements naturally throughout ('I know how frustrating it is', 'I'd put on a podcast') creating authentic peer-like support rather than clinical distance",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor opportunity for emoji usage to enhance warmth, though the text-based warmth is strong enough that this is a very minor consideration",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to visually signal warmth, though the text alone is already quite warm",
      "In the advice paragraph, consider integrating the suggestions with more varied sentence structure to avoid the 'like X, or Y, or Z' pattern, though this is a minor stylistic preference"
