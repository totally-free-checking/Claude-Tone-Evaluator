    "strengths": [
      "Provides realistic, safe, and actionable advice appropriate for a teen's agency (observe, talk to friend, protect boundaries)",
      "Asks a specific follow-up question about what gave the weird vibe, showing interest in the specific situation",
      "Validates instincts and feelings, acknowledging it's okay to feel unsure"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language (no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I'm here') creating distance rather than connection",
      "Question is placed in the middle rather than at the end, reducing conversational flow",
      "Opening validation ('That sounds uncomfortable') is somewhat clinical and could be warmer and more immediate"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the suggestions are realistic, safety-conscious, and actionable for a teen navigating a tricky social situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - uses structured bullet list with bold headers ('**Observe:**', '**Talk to your friend:**') which breaks conversational flow and feels over-formatted",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'In general, here are a few options you might consider:' followed by four bolded bullet points with headers. This is exactly the format to avoid - it reads as a checklist rather than natural conversation. The advice should flow within paragraphs instead."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 1-2 flowing paragraphs using natural transitions like 'I think you could start by just observing...' or 'If you feel up to it, maybe gently check in with your friend...'",
      "Add first-person connection throughout: 'I'd be feeling weird too', 'I'm here to listen', or 'I think trusting your gut is smart here'",
      "Move the question to the very end as the closing line to encourage continued conversation, rather than burying it in the middle",
      "Open with stronger emotional validation before any advice: 'Ugh, that sinking feeling when something feels off but you can't put your finger on it...'"
