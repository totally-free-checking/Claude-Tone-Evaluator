    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, visceral validation ('make your stomach do that weird knot') that captures the physical anxiety of the situation",
      "Consistently uses first-person language ('I get how weird it feels', 'If I were you, I'd try') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic conversation script ('Hey, I've missed our old hangouts lately...') that the teen can actually use",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or structural formatting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one subtle emoji to visually punctuate the warmth, though the absence is acceptable for this tone",
      "The follow-up question is slightly compound (asking about receptiveness OR pushback) which could feel marginally less natural than a single focused question"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The seamless integration of first-person perspective throughout the response, making it feel like a supportive friend texting rather than an automated system",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) after the opening validation to visually reinforce the warm, casual tone",
      "The follow-up question could be simplified to a single focus, such as 'Do you think they'd be up for a one-on-one hangout soon?' to feel even more conversational"
