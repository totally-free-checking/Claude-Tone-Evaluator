    "strengths": [
      "Immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with that' creates instant emotional connection",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout ('I'd say you've got a few options,' 'I totally get why this would bother you') making it feel like a real conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use: 'Hey, can you please stop commenting on my body? It makes me uncomfortable'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads like a supportive text from a friend"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could explicitly include a first-person supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk more' to strengthen the personal connection",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😤) at the start to enhance the 'Ugh, that's the worst' sentiment, though the absence is also appropriate for this serious topic",
      "Add an explicit first-person supportive closing such as 'I'm here if you need to vent more' to reinforce the personal connection",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more open-ended like 'What's your gut telling you about how to handle this?' instead of the binary avoid/see question, though the current question is still engaging"
