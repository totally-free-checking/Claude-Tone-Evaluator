      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you', 'I'd wait', 'I get why') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable conversation scripts ('Hey, I've noticed things feel stricter lately...') rather than vague advice",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji after 'walking on eggshells' slightly mismatches the emotional weight of the stress being described",

      "Consider validating the specific phrase 'for no reason' by explicitly naming that confusion before explaining potential parental stressors",
      "The 😅 emoji works for the awkwardness of the situation, but 💙 or 😊 might better convey support for the stress described, or consider no emoji since the warmth comes through strongly in the language itself"
