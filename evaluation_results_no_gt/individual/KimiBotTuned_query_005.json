    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, warm validation: 'Ugh, I'm so sorry—that's honestly one of the grossest feelings' which acknowledges the unfairness and emotional weight",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—flows naturally like a text conversation across three cohesive paragraphs",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('Yeah, that's not true. Anyway…') and realistic strategies for teen social dynamics"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section lacks first-person perspective, using imperative statements like 'the cleanest move is' and 'keep your vibe calm' rather than 'I think you should' or 'I'd suggest'",
      "Asks two questions at once ('What's the rumor about, and is it mostly happening...') rather than one focused follow-up",
      "The 😅 emoji follows the phrase 'weird and unsafe,' which feels slightly mismatched to the seriousness of feeling unsafe"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting—completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language in the advice section—shifts to impersonal imperative commands rather than maintaining the 'I think'/'I'd say' perspective throughout",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with no formatting artifacts, bullet points, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to the advice section (e.g., 'I'd probably keep my vibe calm...' or 'I think the best approach is...') to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "Consolidate the follow-up into one specific question or ensure the two questions feel like a single natural thought rather than a checklist",
      "Consider either omitting the emoji after 'unsafe' (since 😅 conveys nervous laughter/embarrassment which may not fit the serious tone of safety concerns) or choosing one that matches the emotional weight better"
