      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd definitely') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts for both talking to the partner ('Hey, the project is due tomorrow...') and the teacher ('I wanted to let you know...')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice slightly mismatches the emotional tone - it conveys nervous laughter/awkwardness while the situation calls for frustration/annoyance (😤 or 💙 might fit better)",
      "Could include one more validating phrase after the practical advice to soften the transition (e.g., 'I know it's unfair that you have to chase them down...')"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using an emoji that matches frustration/annoyance (like 😤) or a supportive one (like 💙) rather than 😅 which implies awkwardness",
      "Add one brief validating sentence after the practical advice section to reaffirm that the situation is unfair before asking the follow-up question"
