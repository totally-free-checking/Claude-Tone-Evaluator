    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation ('That's totally understandable—so many people feel that way!') that normalizes the experience",
      "Provides concrete, realistic advice tailored to teen social dynamics (starting with trusted friends, choosing easy-to-eat foods)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers (5 bullets) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice section—uses imperative commands ('Try eating', 'Remind yourself') instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I find that'",
      "Ends with an invitation to chat rather than a specific engaging question to continue the dialogue"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality is strong and age-appropriate, offering specific actionable steps like starting with one or two trusted friends",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is heavily structured with bullet points and bold text, completely breaking the conversational prose flow essential to the character",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response starts with one paragraph of prose, then shifts to 5 formatted bullet points with bold headers (Start small, Remember, Choose foods, Practice positive self-talk, Breathe), then ends with one prose sentence. This reads as a listicle rather than a supportive text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice section as flowing prose using first-person perspective ('I'd suggest starting with just one or two friends you trust...') instead of bullet commands",
      "Add a specific follow-up question at the end like 'What's the part that makes you most nervous—is it worrying about how you look eating, or something else?'",
      "Expand the emotional validation section before offering solutions—spend more time acknowledging how uncomfortable that self-conscious feeling is"
