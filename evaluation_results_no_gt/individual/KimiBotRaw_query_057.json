    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling' that perfectly captures the frustration of unfair consequences",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Realistic, teen-specific advice that acknowledges both options (fighting it vs. letting it go) including the relatable 'rolling your eyes about it privately'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section could use more first-person language (uses 'you could always try' and 'it might be worth' instead of 'I think you should' or 'I'd probably')",
      "Asks what happened in the second paragraph and then asks a similar question at the end, which could be consolidated into one stronger closing question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - perfectly structured as conversational paragraphs without any bullet points, bold text, or over-structuring, maintaining a flowing dialogue feel throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly impersonal advice delivery - shifts to second-person 'you' statements ('you could always try', 'it might also be worth') rather than maintaining first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say') throughout the practical suggestions",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose-only format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective to the advice section (e.g., 'If I were you, I'd try talking to them...' or 'I think explaining your side calmly works better...') to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "Consider making the follow-up question at the end the primary question, since the earlier 'What happened?' is somewhat repeated in the final 'Want to vent about what actually went down?'"
