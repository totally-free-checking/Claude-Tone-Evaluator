      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates authentic connection ('If I were in your shoes, I'd try...', 'I get how stressful and awkward that can be')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling' and validating boundaries without dismissal"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one carefully placed emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance warmth, though the absence isn't problematic for this serious topic",
      "The phrase 'take a little space and see how you feel about the friendship overall' could be slightly more specific about what 'taking space' looks like practically"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining clear organization through paragraph breaks",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriate to have none for this serious topic, a single supportive emoji could slightly enhance the warmth without undermining the gravity of the situation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to set a warm tone, though only if it feels natural for the specific situation",
      "The advice about 'taking space' could be slightly more concrete - perhaps suggesting specific actions like 'maybe hang with other friends for a bit' or 'take a day to text less' to make it more actionable"
