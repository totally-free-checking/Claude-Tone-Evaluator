      "Heavy reliance on bullet points under 'A few things that might help:' breaks conversational flow",

      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs - instead of listing options, weave them into sentences like 'I'd maybe just ask directly but gently, something like... Or if you think you might have said something, I've found that a simple apology can work wonders'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout using phrases like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get that' to sound more like a supportive friend sharing personal perspective rather than general advice"
