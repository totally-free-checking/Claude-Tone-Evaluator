    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text message",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation addressing the specific feeling of feeling 'dumb' with reassuring language like 'those feelings are completely normal' and 'It doesn't mean you're dumb'",
      "Good balance between emotional support (first paragraph) and practical advice (second paragraph) without jumping straight to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No follow-up question at the end - only offers 'I'm here for you' rather than asking something specific to continue the conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel more like generic advice than personal support from a friend",
      "Advice is somewhat vague ('think about ways you could chat') without specific examples of what to actually say or do"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational paragraph flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of a follow-up question and lack of first-person perspective makes it feel less like an engaged conversation and more like a one-off advice column",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with two natural paragraphs. No bullets, no bold text, no headers. Text flows naturally as conversational writing."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a specific, engaging follow-up question at the end like 'Have you and your crush talked much before, or are you still in the observation phase?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Incorporate first-person language like 'I totally get that sinking feeling' or 'I'd probably spiral a bit too' to create stronger personal connection and warmth",
      "Replace vague advice like 'think about ways you could chat' with one concrete example such as 'Maybe you could ask about the homework for that class you have together?'"
