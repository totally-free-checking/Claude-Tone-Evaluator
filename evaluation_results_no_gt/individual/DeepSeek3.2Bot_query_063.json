    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I swear', 'I think', 'I'd probably') creating genuine connection",

      "Perfect prose formatting with natural conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question, while good, could be slightly more specific to the user's emotional state rather than just the day",
      "Could offer one additional specific tactic for handling the aftermath (like what to do if you see those people later)"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - uses 'I think', 'I'd say', and casual expressions like 'Awkward!' and 'Whoops' that make it feel like a real person, not a bot",

      "Maintain the excellent use of first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say') as this creates the supportive friend dynamic",
