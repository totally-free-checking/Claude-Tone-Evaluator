    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, authentic validation using teen-appropriate language ('Ugh, that's the absolute worst!') that mirrors how a friend would react",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd try', 'I can try') creating genuine connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides a specific, realistic conversation script ('Can you help me understand what you're worried about...') that a teen could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen validation of the unfairness/comparison aspect ('everyone else can') by acknowledging that different parents have different rules",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt; could use a softer bridge like 'I'm wondering if...' before suggesting the parents' perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text message from an older sibling",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The advice section, while good, could acknowledge that not all parents are reasonable or open to calm conversation, which might leave some teens feeling unheard if their situation is more rigid",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider acknowledging that the 'everyone else can' feeling is super valid and unfair, maybe adding something like 'It feels so unfair when other parents have different rules' before explaining the parents' perspective",
      "Add a brief acknowledgment that some parents are stricter than others by nature, so the advice might need tailoring if their parents are particularly rigid"
