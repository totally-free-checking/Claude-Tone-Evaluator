      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation using first-person language ('I totally get why this is bothering you,' 'that sucks') and casual empathy ('Ugh')",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen can use ('Hey, I feel like we haven't been as close lately...') rather than vague suggestions"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses 2 emojis (😞 and 💙) which slightly exceeds the ideal maximum of 0-1 per response",

      "Consider reducing emoji usage to 0-1 per response to match the ideal 'sparingly' guideline - perhaps keep the 💙 at the end but drop the 😞, or vice versa",
      "Could briefly acknowledge the specific 'mean' behavior the user mentioned to show you understand the severity (e.g., 'It sucks to see them being mean or acting differently') before moving to the explanation about fitting in"
