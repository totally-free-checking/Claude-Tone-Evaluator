      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so violating and uncomfortable' and 'I totally get why you'd feel exposed'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd start,' 'I think,' 'I totally get') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use verbatim: 'Hey, I noticed you posted that pic of me – can you take it down?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The line 'it feels way bigger in the moment than it has to be' could potentially minimize the teen's feelings by suggesting they're overreacting",
      "Could include slightly more validation after the practical advice section before jumping to the question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with advice flowing organically within conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight minimization in paragraph 2 suggesting the situation 'feels way bigger than it has to be,' which borders on dismissing the legitimate violation of privacy",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose structure with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice is woven into conversational sentences rather than presented as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider removing or softening 'way bigger in the moment than it has to be' to avoid any implication that the teen is overreacting to a privacy violation",
      "Add one more validating sentence after the practical advice (before the question) to bookend the support, such as 'Either way, you're totally justified in feeling upset about this'"
