    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledging the unsettling nature of pressure from trusted friends",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd try', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use verbatim: 'I know you really want to do this, but it just doesn't feel right for me, and I need you to respect that'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question 'How are you feeling about talking to them?' is slightly generic compared to the rest of the highly personalized response",
      "Could add one more sentence validating how difficult boundary-setting can feel before moving to reassurance that it's 'scarier than it actually is'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational first-person tone that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - while present and relevant, it uses a common phrase that could be more uniquely tailored to their specific situation",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural conversational paragraphs with no lists, headers, bold text, or structural formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider making the follow-up question more specific to deepen engagement, such as 'Do you think they'd actually back off if you said that, or are you worried they'll make it awkward?'",
      "Could enhance the validation by adding one sentence acknowledging that setting boundaries with friends is especially hard because you don't want to lose the friendship, before reassuring them about holding their ground"
