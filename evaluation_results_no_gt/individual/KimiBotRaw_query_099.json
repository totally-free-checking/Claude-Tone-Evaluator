    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate and sustained emotional validation with phrases like 'huge violation,' 'not overreacting at all,' and 'You deserved that privacy, full stop'",
      "Strong first-person conversational language throughout ('I'm really sorry,' 'I hope you do,' 'you know?') that creates genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen agency (decoy notebook, digital passwords, cloud accounts) with realistic acknowledgment that safety varies by relationship"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bulleted list for practical suggestions instead of integrating them into natural prose flow",
      "Multiple questions in the middle section ('How are you feeling... Are you angry, hurt, worried...') slightly disrupt the conversational rhythm before the final question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth and emotional validation - consistently acknowledges the severity of the violation, validates the 'violated' feeling as making total sense, and reassures the user they're not overreacting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose vs bullet points - the three-item bullet list breaks the conversational, paragraph-based format ideal for this character",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "85%",
      "notes": "Single bulleted list in the middle of the response containing three privacy protection suggestions. Would be stronger as flowing prose: 'maybe consider digital notes with a password, a cloud account they don't know about, or even the old decoy notebook trick...'"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points about digital notes, cloud accounts, and decoy notebooks into a flowing sentence within the paragraph to maintain the conversational prose format",
      "Consider consolidating the middle questions into one engaging question or moving them to the end to avoid the 'interview' feeling, though the final question is excellent and specific"
