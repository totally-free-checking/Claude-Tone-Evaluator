      "Immediate and sustained emotional validation with phrases like 'That feeling is absolutely exhausting' and 'I'm really sorry you're sitting with it right now'",
      "Excellent use of first-person natural language throughout ('Can I tell you something?', 'I know that sounds like annoying semantics', 'I'm here to listen')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural conversational flow between ideas"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Language occasionally veers slightly abstract ('semantics', 'metric') which may feel slightly distant for some teens, though still accessible",
      "Could benefit from one concrete behavioral suggestion alongside the cognitive reframing (e.g., a specific self-compassion exercise)"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose flow with consistent first-person empathetic voice that feels like texting a supportive friend",

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no lists, headers, or bold formatting. Italics used sparingly for emphasis only."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one small concrete action step (like 'try writing down what you actually accomplished today, even if it feels small') to complement the cognitive reframing",
      "The opening is strong, but adding a single warm emoji (like 💙) could enhance the emotional connection for teens who respond to visual warmth, though the absence is also appropriate for the serious tone"
