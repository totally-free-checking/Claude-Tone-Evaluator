    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that feeling sucks' and acknowledging feeling 'invisible or behind'",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice for teens including concrete examples like 'club meeting once, a beginner video, borrowing supplies' and the relatable reframe that a 'thing' is 'more like a trail you follow than a lightning bolt'",
      "Thoughtful follow-up question that invites self-reflection: 'When do you notice you feel most *you*...'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', 'I'm here if you need to talk') which makes the response feel more like general wisdom than a personal conversation with a supportive friend",
      "Missing a warm closing that reinforces availability for continued support"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout three well-sized paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person 'I' statements throughout the entire response; uses only second-person 'you' and general observations rather than personal connection phrases like 'I totally get that' or 'I'd suggest'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person phrases to create personal connection, such as 'I totally get that feeling' or 'I'd say try not to worry too much about having it all figured out'",
      "Include a brief warm closing with first-person availability like 'I'm here if you want to talk more about this' to reinforce the supportive relationship"
