    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong practical advice specific to teen agency (suggesting phone scrolling, library, outside seating, looking 'busy and purposeful')",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling!') that acknowledges the awkwardness of the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel slightly impersonal rather than like a supportive friend sharing their perspective",
      "Emoji choice (😅) conveys nervousness/embarrassment rather than warmth or solidarity - a warmer emoji or none might better support the teen",
      "Missing explicit solidarity statements like 'We've all been there' or 'You're not alone' that would strengthen the validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and structured advice lists, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective - the response advises using 'you could' and 'that might feel' rather than sharing personal connection through 'I think' or 'I'd feel the same way'",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: try 'I totally get how that feels' or 'I'd be overthinking it too' instead of only using second-person advice",
      "Consider replacing 😅 with a warmer emoji like 😊 or 💙, or omitting it entirely, since 😅 can emphasize the awkwardness rather than providing comfort",
      "Include a brief solidarity statement like 'Literally everyone has had this moment' to reinforce that they're not alone in this experience"
