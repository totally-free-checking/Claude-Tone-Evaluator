    "weaknesses": [
      "Over-structured format with heavy use of bullet points, headers (###), and bold text reads like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' makes it feel impersonal and instructional rather than like a supportive friend",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation - instead of listing 'Buy 5-10 seconds,' write something like 'I'd say buying yourself 5-10 seconds is totally fair game - you could say something like...'",
      "Add first-person connection language like 'I totally get this - that blank-mind panic is the worst' and 'I'd probably start with...' to make it feel like a real person talking, not a manual",
      "Move the scientific explanation ('threat mode') after emotional validation, or soften it with warmth like 'Your brain isn't broken - it's just doing this annoying protective thing...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅) early on to signal this is a safe, casual space before diving into the structured advice"
