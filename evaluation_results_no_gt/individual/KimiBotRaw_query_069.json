      "Excellent practical advice with specific scripts the teen can use like 'Hey, when you joke about [topic], it actually bothers me more than you probably realize'",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging question ('How long has this been going on?') that invites continuation",
      "Opens with strong validation acknowledging the 'frustrating gray area' and validates that questioning the behavior is itself a clue"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers ('The vibe check:', 'The pattern:', etc.) makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive text conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' - feels impersonal like an advice column rather than a friend",
      "Over-structured format with bold headers and multiple bullet lists disrupts conversational flow"

      "notes": "Response uses bold headers and multiple bullet lists throughout ('The vibe check:', 'The pattern:', etc.). Only the opening and closing sentences are prose. Reads like an informational guide rather than a supportive message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation - instead of listing 'Are you laughing too?', write something like 'I'd ask yourself - when they joke around, are you actually laughing or just pretending so you don't seem sensitive?'",
      "Add first-person connection throughout - use phrases like 'I think the biggest clue is...', 'I'd suggest trying...', or 'I get how confusing that feels' to make it feel like a real person talking",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to soften the clinical structure, since the heavy formatting creates distance"
