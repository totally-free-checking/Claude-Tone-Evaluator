      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oof, yeah that phrase alone is enough to put anyone on the defensive' - perfectly captures the teen's frustration",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person ownership in advice section - uses impersonal 'Sometimes it helps' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think'",

      "Consider adding a brief 'I've totally been there' or 'I get that sinking feeling' to increase first-person connection before offering solutions"
