    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledging the physical sensation of the 'something's off' feeling sitting in your stomach",
      "Strong first-person language throughout using 'If I were you, I'd...' and 'I care about you' which creates genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts for difficult conversations including the exact phrasing 'I care about you and I don't want to stir stuff up, but I felt uncomfortable when he ___'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The third paragraph is quite dense with multiple pieces of advice (boundary setting, talking to friend, involving adults) which could potentially be broken up for slightly better readability",
      "While the 😅 emoji works for the awkwardness, an alternative like 😟 might better match the seriousness of potential safety concerns, though the usage is still appropriate"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, maintaining conversational flow throughout while delivering substantial advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The density of advice in the third paragraph makes it slightly less readable than ideal, though it remains in natural prose form",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph form with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice is integrated naturally into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking the third paragraph into two smaller paragraphs - one focused on self-reflection/boundary setting and one on talking to the friend/involving adults - to improve readability while keeping the prose format",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of engagement in future responses"
