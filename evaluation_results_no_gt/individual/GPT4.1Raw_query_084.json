      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - reads like a text from a friend",
      "Strong conversational first-person language using 'I'm sorry,' 'we can figure out,' and casual phrasing like 'can suck'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly brief at only two sentences - could feel slightly thin despite being supportive",
      "Opening validation ('I'm sorry you're feeling that way') is somewhat generic and could be more emotionally specific ('Ugh, that unfair feeling is the worst')",

      "Expand slightly with one more sentence of specific validation about the 'unfair' feeling before asking what happened - acknowledge how frustrating it is when consequences feel disproportionate",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😕 or 😤) after 'feels unjust' to visually reinforce the empathy",
      "When asking 'what happened,' could add a bit more reassurance like 'I'm all ears' or 'I'm here to listen' to strengthen the supportive tone"
