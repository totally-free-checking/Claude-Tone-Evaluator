    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent, specific safety scripts the teen can actually use ('I care about you, but I can't promise secrecy if someone could get hurt')",
      "Appropriately prioritizes safety and gives clear guidance on when to break confidentiality",
      "Asks specific diagnostic questions to assess immediate danger level"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with headers (### 1), numbered sections, and bullet lists that read like a safety manual rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal instructional tone ('A good rule is', 'Ask yourself')",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping to rules and protocols - only 'That's a heavy spot to be in' before immediate advice"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides concrete, actionable scripts and realistic safety steps appropriate for the serious situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses heavy markdown formatting with 5 numbered sections and multiple bullet lists instead of conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 15,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses ### headers, numbered sections (1-5), and extensive bullet lists throughout. Reads like a wikiHow safety guide or professional protocol rather than a text conversation with a supportive friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 flowing paragraphs of natural prose, removing all headers, numbers, and bullet points - let the advice flow conversationally",
      "Add first-person connection throughout: 'I think the most important thing here...', 'I'd be really worried too...', 'I'm glad you reached out about this'",
      "Replace the list of three questions at the end with one natural follow-up like 'Do you want to tell me a bit more about what kind of secret it is? I'm here to help you figure this out'",
      "Start with more emotional validation before any advice: 'I'm so glad you told me - that sounds like such a stressful position to be in, and it's okay that you're unsure what to do'"
