    "strengths": [
      "Excellent specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the context ('are the snaps like random memes, or are they trying to talk/vent/flirt?')",
      "Very practical, actionable advice with realistic teen-specific solutions (muting specific friends, DND settings) and actual text scripts they can use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers makes it read like a wiki article rather than a conversation - uses 6+ bullet points across two formatted sections",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') - feels impersonal and instructional rather than supportive",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping to solutions - only 'That's rough' before immediately listing fixes"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific, realistic actions and text templates a teen could actually use right now",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response is approximately 80% structured lists and bold headers rather than conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses two distinct bullet sections with bold headers ('Quick boundary', 'Practical fix'). Only 1-2 sentences of actual prose at the beginning and end. Heavy formatting breaks conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural flowing paragraphs using first-person suggestions like 'I'd probably start by...' or 'You could try saying something like...'",
      "Add more emotional validation upfront before giving advice - acknowledge how exhausting and frustrating it must be to be woken up repeatedly",
      "Remove bold headers and formatting - instead use natural transitions like 'If you want to be gentle about it...' or 'If you prefer avoiding confrontation...'"
