    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emoji usage with the 😅 perfectly capturing the awkwardness without overdoing it",
      "Follow-up questions are highly specific and engaging, distinguishing between 'unresolved drama' and the 'weird limbo' of drifting apart",
      "Practical advice includes realistic, specific phrases a teen could actually use like 'hey, how's it going?'",
      "Opens with relatable validation ('social anxiety bingo') that acknowledges the emotional weight"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bulleted list ('you've got a few options:') instead of natural prose flow, making it read like a self-help article rather than a text from a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel impersonal despite casual word choice",
      "Could open with stronger emotional validation before jumping to the clarifying question",
      "'Are we talking about...' phrasing feels slightly clinical/interview-like rather than warm and supportive"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up questions at the end are natural, specific to the situation, and show genuine curiosity about whether this is unresolved drama or just drifting apart",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The bullet point formatting - it literally uses 'you've got a few options:' followed by a bulleted list, which is exactly the 'self-help article' format the ideal character avoids",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'Either way, you've got a few options:' followed by three bullet points. This is a major structural red flag that disrupts the conversational flow. The bullets contain good advice but should be woven into natural sentences instead."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points to flowing prose: 'If you want to keep it light, you could just give them a friendly nod or ask how it's going. If that feels too intense, there's nothing wrong with just focusing on your phone and giving each other space.'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: 'I totally get why that feels awkward' or 'I'd probably be overthinking every little movement too'",
      "Start with stronger validation before asking questions: 'Ugh, that's such a uncomfortable feeling' or 'Oh no, that's literally the worst' before asking about the context",
      "Avoid 'Are we talking about...' phrasing and instead use something like 'So are you stuck there for a while, like on a plane or in class?'"
