    "strengths": [
      "Excellent specific follow-up question at the end that asks about specific competition topics and reactions, showing genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
      "Provides concrete, realistic scripts and phrases the teen can actually use in the moment (e.g., 'I'm not trying to compete—I'm just sharing')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it')—reads as impersonal instructional manual rather than supportive friend",
      "Overwhelmingly structured with headers (### 1, ### 2) and bullet points instead of natural prose paragraphs, resembling a wikiHow article",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping into extensive advice—only one brief sentence acknowledging feelings before 5 sections of solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question is natural, specific, and invites continued conversation by asking about the types of competition and the friend's reactions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The response is formatted as a heavily structured list with numbered headers and bullet points rather than conversational prose, making it feel like an instruction manual rather than a text from a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 13,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 5 numbered headers (### 1 through ### 5) with multiple bullet points under each section. Only the opening sentence and final paragraph are prose. The advice is presented as a structured list rather than flowing naturally within paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as 2-3 natural prose paragraphs instead of numbered sections with bullets—imagine texting a friend: 'I'd probably start by gently naming it in the moment. Something like...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get how annoying that is') to create personal connection rather than imperative instructions",
      "Start with 2-3 sentences of validation before giving advice—acknowledge how draining and lonely that competitive dynamic feels"
