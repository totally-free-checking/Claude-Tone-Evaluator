    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'I totally get it' and acknowledging the 'paralyzing' feeling of overwhelm",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice (15-minute tasks, concrete examples like 'opening that one email')",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm here to help you', 'Let's take a deep breath together')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice could be slightly softer - moves quickly to 'First, just pick one' without a brief bridge acknowledging the difficulty",
      "While the emoji is appropriate, the 💪 might feel slightly generic compared to the warm tone established (😊 or 😅 might fit better, or no emoji)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward practical advice over emotional support - could use one more sentence validating how stressful the pile-up feels before offering the 'pick one small thing' strategy",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice is integrated naturally into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief transitional sentence between the validation and advice sections to soften the pivot (e.g., 'It's okay to feel stuck, and here's what might help...')",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be even more conversational by using 'What do you think?' or 'How does that sound?' after asking about the tiny task"
