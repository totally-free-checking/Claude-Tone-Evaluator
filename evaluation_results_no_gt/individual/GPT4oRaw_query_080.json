    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points, reading like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Strong use of first-person empathetic language like 'I totally get why you'd be anxious' and casual teen-appropriate phrasing like 'spiral'",
      "Good conversational flow with contractions and natural transitions between validation, reframing, and advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice is somewhat generic ('stay open-minded, listen, and stay calm') without specific scripts or concrete preparation steps",
      "The phrase 'try not to spiral just yet' could slightly minimize the intensity of the user's terror before fully validating it",
      "Follow-up question is slightly awkward with 'anything else' though it recovers with the specific 'distract yourself or prepare' framing"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - the response flows as conversational paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, perfectly matching the ideal character's texting-like style",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice specificity - the suggestions remain at a general level ('take a deep breath', 'stay calm') rather than offering concrete phrases to say or specific preparation tactics for the conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add specific conversation scripts or phrases the teen could use during the 'talk' to make the advice more actionable (e.g., 'You could start with: I appreciate you telling me this in person...')",
      "Consider deepening the initial validation to acknowledge the 'terror' feeling more specifically before moving to the 'don't spiral' reassurance",
      "The follow-up question could be more engaging by asking about the specific relationship or context (e.g., 'Is this from a friend, parent, or partner?') rather than the general 'anything else'"
