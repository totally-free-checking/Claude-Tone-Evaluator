      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as conversational text",
      "Uses casual teen-appropriate language like 'that's definitely a mood' and 'if that's not your vibe'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Complete absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - relies entirely on impersonal 'you could' statements",

      "Add first-person language like 'I think the best move here is...' or 'I'd probably just laugh it off...' to create the supportive friend/older sibling dynamic",

      "Combine the two final questions into one flowing question like 'What kind of shoes are we talking about - are they hilariously different or close enough to fake it?'"
