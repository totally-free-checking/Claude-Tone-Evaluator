    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with visceral empathy ('I get how your stomach can flip and everyone's vibe can feel tense')",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I get how') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I hear you, but I'm not comfortable with that...')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while conveying nervousness/awkwardness, might slightly understate the seriousness of peer pressure compared to more supportive choices like 💙",
      "Could briefly acknowledge the specific fear of damaging the friendship, which is often the core anxiety in these situations"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 💙 or 😟 instead of 😅 for serious peer pressure topics to better match the emotional gravity while maintaining warmth",
      "Could add one line acknowledging that worrying about losing the friendship is totally normal, since that's often the underlying fear driving the discomfort"
