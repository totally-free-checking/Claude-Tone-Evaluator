      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's the worst!') that names the specific 'panicked oh no moment' feeling",
      "Uses natural first-person advice format ('If I were you, I'd check in...') that feels like peer support rather than directives",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for talking to coach ('Hey, I totally blanked and double-booked myself today') that a teen could actually use",
