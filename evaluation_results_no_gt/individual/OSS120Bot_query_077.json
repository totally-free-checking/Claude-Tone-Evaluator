    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm really sorry', 'I'd say') creating a personal connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I'm really sorry, but I think it's important to tell someone because it could get dangerous')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses two questions at the end instead of one focused question ('What's the secret about, and how are you feeling...')",
      "Emoji choice (😅) feels slightly mismatched with the serious/heavy context of the secret, though only one is used"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no formatting structures, bullet lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using a more supportive emoji like 💙 or 😊 for serious topics, or omitting entirely if the tone feels too heavy for emoji use",
      "Streamline the ending to one specific question rather than two, such as 'How are you feeling about what to do next?' to keep the conversation focused"
