      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I'm really sorry') creating genuine personal connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation that names the specific weight of the feeling ('That feeling is so heavy', 'absolutely exhausting') before offering any advice",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice, while solid, could include one specific 'try this today' micro-action to make it even more actionable",
