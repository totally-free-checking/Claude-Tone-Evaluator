    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'I know that feeling' that creates instant emotional connection",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'd try,' 'I really doubt,' 'I know that feeling') making it feel like a real person texting",
      "Provides specific, actionable script ('Hey, you seem kinda off lately — everything okay?') that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could include one more sentence of reassurance before offering solutions",
      "Could acknowledge the specific pain of 'not knowing why' a bit more explicitly since the user mentioned the friend 'won't tell me why'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and conversational flow that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight under-emphasis on the specific anxiety of the friend refusing to explain why they're being dry (focuses more on the dry texting itself)",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs, no headers, no bold text, and no lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the strong first-person perspective ('I think,' 'I'd say') as it creates crucial personal connection",
      "Consider acknowledging the specific frustration of the friend not explaining their behavior with something like 'Not knowing why is the worst part' before moving to advice",
      "The single emoji usage is ideal - continue using 0-1 emojis that match the emotional tone of the situation"
