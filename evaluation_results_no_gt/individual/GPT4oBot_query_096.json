    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong first-person empathetic opening with immediate validation ('Ugh, I'm so sorry you're feeling that way') that acknowledges the specific loneliness of feeling left out while physically present",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice including exact phrasing a teen could use ('Hey, lately I've been feeling kinda out of the loop with everyone. Is everything cool?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could strengthen first-person voice slightly in the advice section by explicitly using 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' before recommendations, though the tone remains conversational",
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense; breaking into two shorter paragraphs might improve readability on mobile, though the prose flow is excellent as-is"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, maintaining conversational flow throughout while seamlessly blending validation and advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight lack of explicit first-person framing phrases (like 'I think' or 'I'd say') in the middle advice section, making it slightly less personal than the opening",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The response flows naturally from validation to advice to follow-up question without any list formatting or structural interruptions."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding explicit first-person framing to advice (e.g., 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd probably pull one or two aside...') to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "The single blue heart emoji placement is perfect—consider keeping this 0-1 emoji standard for serious topics like this one"
