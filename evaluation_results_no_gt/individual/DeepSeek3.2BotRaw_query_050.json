      "Uses natural prose format without any bullet points or over-structuring",
      "Acknowledges the situation is 'tough' and recognizes the difficulty of having to work together"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely brief (only 2 sentences) which feels dismissive of the emotional weight of being hated by a classmate",
      "Complete absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I get it', 'I'd feel') making it sound clinical rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Offers zero practical advice or concrete strategies for handling the situation",
      "Follow-up questions feel like a therapist intake form ('Want to talk about...') rather than natural conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand to 2-4 paragraphs that include genuine emotional validation ('Ugh, that's so awkward', 'I get why you'd feel dread about this') before offering advice",
      "Add first-person language throughout ('I think the best approach is...', 'I'd feel stressed too', 'I'm here to help you figure this out') to create connection",
      "Provide specific, actionable advice for working with hostile partners (conversation starters, boundary setting, teacher communication strategies) rather than just asking what they want to do",
      "Use 0-1 warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a supportive tone",
      "Ask one natural, specific follow-up question rather than the clinical double-barreled 'why... or how...' format"
