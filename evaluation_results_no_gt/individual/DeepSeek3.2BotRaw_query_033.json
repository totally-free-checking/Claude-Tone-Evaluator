    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with flowing paragraphs",
      "Opens with strong validation ('It totally makes sense that you're mad') and uses casual language ('stinks') that acknowledges the unfairness of the situation",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice for a teen including exact phrasing for talking to the teacher and alternative times to see friends"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - closes with a statement ('I hope things get better soon') rather than engaging the user to continue the conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal constructions like 'Sometimes teachers try...' and 'you could try' instead of 'I think you could...' or 'I'd suggest...' which makes it feel less like a supportive friend",
      "Could open with more immediate emotional resonance ('Ugh, that's the worst!') rather than the slightly clinical 'It totally makes sense'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with 100% paragraph structure and zero bullet points, creating a conversational flow perfect for texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing follow-up question engagement - fails to end with a question that would invite the teen to share more or continue the conversation",

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose with four flowing paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting used. Advice is integrated into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a follow-up question at the end like 'Have you tried talking to your teacher yet, or are you nervous about how they might react?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout such as 'I think you should...' or 'I'd probably feel the same way' or 'I'm here if you need to vent more' to create a stronger personal connection",
      "Consider opening with slightly more energetic validation like 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' before acknowledging that it makes sense to be mad"
