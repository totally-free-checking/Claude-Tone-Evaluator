      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text message",
      "Immediately validates the teen's feelings with 'That sounds really tough!' and acknowledges the emotional impact ('draining and stressful')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I'm here' to create personal connection",
      "Fails to provide any concrete advice or actionable suggestions, only tentatively offers to give tips later ('If you want, I can offer some tips')",
      "Response is too brief and feels dismissive - only 4 short sentences that don't fully engage with the emotional weight of the situation",
      "Questions feel clinical and multiple-choice rather than conversational ('Do you want to talk about X or Y?')"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring",

      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: instead of 'That sounds really tough,' try 'Ugh, I get how exhausting that must be' or 'I'd feel so drained in that situation'",
      "Provide at least one concrete piece of advice or insight immediately rather than just offering to give tips later - teens need proactive support, not a menu of options",
      "Expand the response to 2-3 substantial paragraphs: validate more deeply, share a specific observation or suggestion, then ask a more natural follow-up question like 'What's the worst part of being in the middle of all that?'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a supportive tone"
