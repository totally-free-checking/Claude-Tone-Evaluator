    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language that creates genuine connection ('I get why you're worried', 'If I were you, I'd keep doing your thing', 'I'd say')",
      "Immediate emotional validation with natural casual language ('Ugh, that really sucks', 'heavy vibe', 'weird energy') that sounds like a supportive peer",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points—flows naturally like a text conversation with natural paragraph breaks"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice to ask for 'help on something small' could be more specific about what that looks like (e.g., clarifying a specific assignment vs. general office hours)",
      "Ends with two questions rather than one, though they are related and conversational"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The conversational tone and first-person language usage—it perfectly captures the supportive older sibling/friend voice with phrases like 'I get why you're worried' and 'If I were you' rather than impersonal directives",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice, while realistic, could offer slightly more concrete examples of what 'breaking the ice' looks like in a classroom context",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or excessive formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out structurally."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider specifying what 'something small' means for breaking the ice with the teacher—e.g., 'asking about a specific homework problem' or 'clarifying the due date' to make the advice more actionable",
      "While the two ending questions work well together, you could combine them into one flowing question or choose the most engaging one to keep it streamlined"
