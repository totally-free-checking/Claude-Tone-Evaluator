      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying' and 'I'd be exhausted too' that mirrors the user's frustration",

      "Could use more explicit first-person language in the advice section (e.g., 'I'd suggest saying...' instead of 'you can say') to strengthen the personal connection",
