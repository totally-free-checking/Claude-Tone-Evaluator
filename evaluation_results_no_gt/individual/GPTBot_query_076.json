      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice with concrete steps like the 'energy audit' and '3 tiny experiments' that a teen could actually do",
      "Follow-up questions are specific and insightful (especially 'What are you jealous of?' which shows psychological sophistication)",
      "Acknowledges that burnout or low mood might be the real issue, not lack of personality"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I get it', 'I'd say') making it feel like an advice column rather than a supportive friend",
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points, numbered lists, and bold formatting instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Opens with cognitive reframing rather than emotional validation ('Ugh, that feeling sucks' or 'That's so relatable')"

      "notes": "Response uses multiple formatted sections including bullet points under 'A few reframes', a numbered 3-step plan with sub-bullets, and bold headers throughout. Only the opening and burnout paragraphs are natural prose."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the entire response as 2-3 flowing paragraphs without bullet points, integrating the advice naturally into sentences ('I'd suggest trying a quick energy audit where you write down...')",
      "Add first-person connection language throughout ('I totally get that feeling', 'I've been there', 'I think the best approach is...')",
      "Start with immediate emotional validation before any advice ('Ugh, that comparison trap is the worst - I've totally felt that')",
      "Reduce the three follow-up questions to one natural question at the very end"
