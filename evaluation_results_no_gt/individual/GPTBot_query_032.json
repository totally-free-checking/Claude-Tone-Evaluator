    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts and phrases the teen can actually use ('Hey, I’ve noticed you’ve seemed a bit distant lately...')",
      "Ends with a strong, specific follow-up question that invites more detail about the situation ('If you tell me what changed... I can help you choose the best wording')",
      "Acknowledges the feeling upfront as 'unsettling' and validates that the brain fills in blanks"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with headers (###), numbered lists (1-5), and bullet points throughout - reads like a wikiHow article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - feels instructional and detached rather than like a supportive friend sharing perspective",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping into extensive problem-solving mode - only one brief sentence of validation before 5 sections of advice"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality and specific conversation scripts provided are highly actionable and realistic for teen social situations",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is extremely over-structured with numbered sections, headers, and bullet points, making it feel like a self-help manual rather than a warm conversational text",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural paragraphs without headers or bullet points - flow the advice conversationally instead of listing it",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout ('I think the best approach would be...', 'I’ve definitely been in that spiral before', 'I’d probably start by...') to create connection",
      "Start with 2-3 sentences of genuine emotional validation before offering any advice - sit with the feeling of anxiety before fixing it",
      "Reduce length by about 50% - teens need 2-3 key ideas, not a 5-step comprehensive guide"
