      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text message",

      "Appropriately balances immediate advice with safety considerations, acknowledging when to involve adults"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', 'I'm here') making it feel like generic advice rather than personal support from someone who cares",
      "Places the question in the middle of the response rather than ending with it, failing to invite continued conversation and closure",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection, such as 'I think that's really scary to deal with' or 'I'd suggest trying...' instead of general statements",
      "Move the question to the very end of the response and make it more engaging/specific to invite continued conversation, such as 'How are you feeling about confronting them?'",
      "Open with warmer, more immediate emotional validation like 'Ugh, that's such a stressful situation' or 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with that' before moving to solutions"
