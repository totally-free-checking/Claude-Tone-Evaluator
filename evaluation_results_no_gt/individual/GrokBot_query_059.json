    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get why') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that really stings, doesn't it?' and acknowledgment of feeling undervalued",
      "Perfect prose format with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or structural formatting",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact script wording ('Hey, I've noticed I'm usually the one starting our chats...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji 😅 placement after discussing friendship imbalance slightly mismatches the emotional weight of feeling undervalued, though it works for the 'we've all been there' transition",
      "The phrase 'more even effort' in the final paragraph is slightly awkward/uncommon compared to 'equal effort' or 'balanced effort'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The consistent use of first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get why') combined with natural prose paragraphs creates an authentic conversational tone",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The emoji choice (😅) could better align with the emotional vulnerability of the situation, as it suggests awkward laughter rather than the hurt/uncertainty described",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using a more emotionally aligned emoji like 😔 or 😕 to match the 'stings' feeling, or reserve 😅 specifically for the 'we've all been there' camaraderie moment",
      "Replace 'more even effort' with 'more balanced effort' or 'equal effort' for more natural phrasing",
      "Optionally add one brief validation sentence within the advice paragraph (e.g., 'I know it's scary to pull back') to maintain emotional warmth while giving practical steps"
