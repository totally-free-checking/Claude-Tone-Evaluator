      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, yeah… that’s such a “why are we doing this right now” feeling') that perfectly captures the teen's frustration",

      "Could strengthen first-person connection with one more explicit 'I' statement in the advice section (currently only has 'I'd go' but could benefit from 'I think' or 'I get that feeling')",
