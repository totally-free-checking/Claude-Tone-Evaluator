    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's basically emotional gasoline' that perfectly captures the frustration",
      "Excellent natural prose flow without any formatting crutches - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Insightful reframing of 'calm down' as the other person's discomfort rather than the user's fault, which is validating and perspective-shifting",
      "Perfect follow-up question offering two specific paths (venting vs validation) that shows genuine engagement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks concrete practical advice for handling the situation next time (e.g., what to say back, how to self-regulate)",
      "Could use more first-person language throughout the middle section ('I get why that would sting') rather than just at the end"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow - it completely avoids bullet points and reads like an authentic text conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The balance skews heavily toward emotional support with minimal practical solutions or actionable next steps",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs and no structural formatting. Uses italics for emphasis which enhances conversational tone without breaking flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one small practical suggestion for future interactions (e.g., 'Next time, you could try saying...') while keeping the validation focus",
      "Incorporate more first-person connection in the middle section like 'I totally get why that makes you want to scream' to maintain the personal voice throughout"
