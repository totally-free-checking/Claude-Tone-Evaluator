      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so awkward and uncomfortable!' followed by acknowledgment of the anxious feeling",
      "Provides specific, realistic script the teen can use: 'Hey, I noticed things feel weird since you looked at my phone - did you see something that worried you?'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd say' implied) creating genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly acknowledge the privacy violation aspect of parents checking the phone, not just the awkward aftermath (minor)",

      "Consider acknowledging that having their phone checked might feel like a privacy violation, validating both the invasion and the awkward aftermath",

      "Maintain the current balance of 1 emoji per response and first-person language usage - this creates the perfect supportive friend persona"
