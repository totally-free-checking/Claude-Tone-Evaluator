      "The follow-up questions at the end are specific and engaging, asking about how the friend reacted and the nature of the relationship to tailor future advice",
      "Provides concrete, realistic phrases the teen can actually use in conversation (e.g., 'I get why that stung. I care about you.')",
      "Acknowledges red flags and boundary-setting, which is important for healthy friendship dynamics"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy over-structuring with headers (### 1, ### 2, etc.) and bullet points makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Opens with analysis ('it usually comes down to one of a few things') rather than immediate emotional validation ('That sounds so stressful' or 'Ugh, that's rough')",
      "Lacks first-person conversational language throughout the advice sections - uses impersonal instructional tone ('You can ask something like' instead of 'I'd probably ask them')",
      "No emoji usage to soften the clinical, structured format, though the serious topic could warrant one warm emoji"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question engagement is strong and natural, specifically asking about the friend's reaction style and relationship context to continue the conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is extremely over-structured with numbered headers and bullet lists, completely breaking the conversational prose format essential for a teen support bot",

      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses four major section headers (### 1 through ### 4) with extensive bullet points under each. Only the opening and closing paragraphs are prose. This reads as an instructional guide rather than a supportive text message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural paragraphs without headers or bullet points - flow the advice as a conversation ('I think I'd start by figuring out what they're actually upset about... Maybe they felt left out or insecure')",
      "Begin with immediate emotional validation before any analysis - something like 'Ugh, that's such a stressful situation. It hurts when someone gets mad at us for just living our life'",
      "Replace instructional 'you can' language with personal first-person perspective throughout ('I'd say something like...' or 'I think the key is...') to sound like a supportive friend rather than a manual"
