    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such an invasion of privacy') that acknowledges the awkwardness and tension",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I can totally imagine,' 'If I were you, I'd probably') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use ('Hey, you've been acting weird since you checked my phone...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'or whatever' when describing parents' motivations could slightly undermine the empathy, though it fits the casual teen voice",
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) to soften the opening, though the absence is acceptable for this serious topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and conversational flow that reads like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight risk of the normalization ('lots of parents get nosy') feeling minimizing, though it effectively validates that this is a common experience",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs, no headers, no bold text, and no lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being structured as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after the opening validation to enhance warmth without undermining the seriousness",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be slightly more concise: 'Are you worried about something specific they saw, or is it more about the privacy violation?' maintains the same meaning with fewer words"
