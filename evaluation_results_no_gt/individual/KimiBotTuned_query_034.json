    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, getting hit with “calm down” is so annoying') that mirrors the teen's frustration and normalizes their reaction",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Don’t tell me to calm down—just hear me out,' 'I’ll calm down when I feel listened to') rather than vague advice",
      "Uses natural prose throughout with zero bullet points, reading like a supportive text from a friend rather than a structured self-help guide"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person 'I' language (e.g., 'I think,' 'I get it,' 'I'd say') which makes it slightly less personal than ideal; relies heavily on 'you' statements instead",
      "Could include a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar first-person supportive closing to strengthen the personal connection"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language ('I think,' 'I get it,' 'I'm here') makes the response feel slightly impersonal despite being warm and conversational",

      "Incorporate first-person language like 'I totally get why that would make you feel worse' or 'I think the best approach is...' to create stronger personal connection",
