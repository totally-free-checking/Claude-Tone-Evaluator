    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific language like 'worst sinking feeling' and 'We've all been there' that makes the teen feel understood",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd maybe ask', 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Specific, realistic advice tailored to social media anxiety (turning off notifications, hiding posts, asking a trusted friend) rather than generic platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition between the second and third paragraphs could include a brief additional validation before jumping to solutions, though the balance is still strong",
      "Could potentially include one more 'I' statement in the middle paragraph to maintain the personal connection throughout, though the tone remains conversational"

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no structural formatting, headers, or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized, maintaining the conversational text-message style ideal for this character."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') as it appears here - this creates crucial personal connection",
      "The follow-up question distinguishing between recent vs. old posts is excellent specificity; maintain this level of situational awareness in future responses",
      "The single emoji (😅) placement is perfect - consider this the standard for appropriate emoji usage (0-1 per response, situationally appropriate)"
