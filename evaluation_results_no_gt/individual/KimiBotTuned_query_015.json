      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's *so* infuriating') and normalizes the anger ('you're not being dramatic for being mad')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact scripts ('I'm not okay with you going through my things...') and practical interim solutions (locking items in a bag/drawer)"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice section—uses 'If you can, try...' and 'it might be worth...' instead of 'I think you should...' or 'I'd suggest...' which would create more personal connection",
      "The 😅 emoji choice feels slightly mismatched after 'infuriating' (😅 typically conveys nervousness/embarrassment rather than anger/validation)"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to the advice section like 'I'd probably try to catch them in a calmer moment' or 'I think the best approach is...' to make it feel more like personal advice from a friend rather than generic instructions",
      "Consider either removing the emoji after 'infuriating' or switching to one that better matches the emotion (like 😤 or 💙) since 😅 implies nervous laughter which slightly undercuts the validation of their anger"
