    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with physical empathy ('makes your whole body go tense') and reassurance ('you're not overreacting')",
      "Specific, actionable scripts provided ('When ___ was said today, it felt racist/sexist...') including low-risk in-the-moment phrases like 'Not cool'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice may slightly undermine the severity of racism/sexism, though it fits the awkward disbelief of the moment",
      "Could more explicitly name the harm ('that was racist/sexist and wrong') rather than just 'gross' to validate the moral weight of the situation"

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no formatting structures. Advice is woven into narrative form ('If you feel safe doing it, I'd talk to the teacher...') rather than listed as steps."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider replacing 😅 with 💙 or 😔 for serious topics involving discrimination to match the emotional weight while maintaining warmth",
      "Explicitly name that the behavior was wrong/biased rather than just 'gross' to validate the teen's moral compass about racism/sexism",
      "Maintain the excellent balance of validation-first structure and specific scripting - this is exactly the right approach for this character"
