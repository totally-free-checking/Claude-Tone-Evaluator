    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout creates genuine connection (e.g., 'I totally get that cringe spiral,' 'If I were you, I'd maybe try,' 'I promise it feels way bigger to you')",
      "Opens with immediate, specific validation that mirrors the user's experience ('Ugh, that's the absolute worst feeling,' 'your brain just refuses to let you move on—it just keeps hitting rewind')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow—zero bullets, headers, or over-structuring that would feel clinical",
      "Strong, specific follow-up question that offers two genuine conversational options and references the user's specific situation ('what happened' and 'annoying your brain')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the supportive tone, though the absence is still appropriate",
      "Practical advice, while realistic, could include one specific technique for stopping intrusive replay thoughts (like the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding method or writing it down)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language that sounds like texting a supportive friend rather than reading a self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly limited range of practical strategies for the specific 'replay' symptom—focuses mainly on distraction rather than cognitive techniques to stop the spiral",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No bullets, numbered lists, bold headers, or excessive formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to visually signal warmth, especially since the topic involves embarrassment",
      "Include one specific cognitive technique for intrusive thoughts, such as 'when you notice the replay starting, try naming 5 things you can see right now' or 'write down exactly what happened for 2 minutes, then crumple it up'"
