      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using natural teen expressions like 'Ugh' and 'honestly the worst' that capture the awkwardness perfectly",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('hey', 'how've you been?', 'I focus better somewhere else') rather than vague suggestions",
      "Maintains pure conversational prose throughout with zero formatting artifacts—reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd feel', 'I get it') which makes the response feel slightly impersonal despite being warm",
      "Missing a supportive closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk' that would reinforce the supportive relationship"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—advice flows organically within conversational paragraphs that read like a text message",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person 'I' statements throughout the entire response; uses second-person 'you' exclusively which creates distance rather than the intended 'friend texting' intimacy",

      "Add first-person connection phrases like 'I totally get that sinking feeling' or 'I'd be so stressed in that situation' to create the intended personal bond",
      "Include a brief supportive closing such as 'I'm here if you need to talk through it more' to reinforce that this is an ongoing supportive conversation"
