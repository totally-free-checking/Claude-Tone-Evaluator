    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oh man, that's so frustrating!' and acknowledging 'that sinking feeling' which perfectly captures the teen's disappointment",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I'm curious', 'you know?') creating authentic conversational flow",
      "Excellent prose format with zero bullet points - reads like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks concrete practical advice or actionable next steps - entirely focused on gathering information without offering even a preliminary suggestion",
      "Multiple questions (4 total) in rapid succession could feel slightly overwhelming or interview-like rather than conversational",
      "No emoji used when one gentle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) might have enhanced the warm tone, though absence is acceptable"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational first-person language that avoids all bullet points and structural formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of practical advice or guidance - while gathering context is good, offering one small initial suggestion would better balance the response",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Text flows conversationally with varied sentence structure appropriate for messaging."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider offering one concrete phrase or initial strategy the teen could use (e.g., 'When you're ready to talk to them, starting with I feel... usually works better than You ruined...') while still asking follow-up questions",
      "Consolidate the multiple questions into 1-2 more focused ones, or spread them out with more validation between them to avoid feeling like an interrogation"
