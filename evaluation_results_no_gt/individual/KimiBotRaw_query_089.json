    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language ('Oh man, that spiral is the *worst*', 'Yeah, I've been there') that normalizes the struggle",
      "Excellent use of first-person connection and casual tone ('I've been there', 'Let's do a quick reset', 'vomit it onto the page') that sounds like a supportive friend",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice tailored to teen life (mentioning TikTok, using phone/napkin for brain dump, examples like 'Put one dish in the dishwasher')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers ('First, brain dump.', 'Then, pick the tiniest possible win.', 'The 5-minute trick:') breaks conversational flow",
      "Advice section shifts to imperative/instructional tone in bullets rather than maintaining first-person conversational style ('Grab your phone', 'Tell yourself')"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and emotional validation - uses natural contractions, first-person sharing ('I've been there'), and casual phrasing ('that sucker') that perfectly captures the supportive friend voice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting and structure - uses three distinct bullet points with bold headers instead of flowing prose paragraphs, making it read more like a self-help list than a text conversation",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "65%",
      "notes": "Response uses bold headers for three distinct tips (First/Then/The 5-minute trick), creating a structured list format. While the content within bullets is conversational, the formatting is heavily structured and diverges from the ideal prose-only approach"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the three bullet points into natural prose paragraphs - instead of 'First, brain dump. Grab your phone...' try 'I'd start with a brain dump. Grab your phone or a napkin and just list everything...' to maintain flow",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) at the beginning to enhance the casual, friendly tone, or alternatively, keep it at zero but ensure the warmth comes through the text alone",
      "Maintain first-person language throughout the advice section ('I usually tell people to...', 'What works for me is...') rather than shifting to imperative commands in the bullet points"
