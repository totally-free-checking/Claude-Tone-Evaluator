    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and first-person empathy: 'Oh man, I totally get why you're feeling anxious' and 'that's such a normal reaction'",
      "Ends with an excellent, natural follow-up question that invites specifics: 'What kind of grade was it, and do you have a sense of how your parents typically react to school stuff?'",
      "Provides realistic, age-appropriate advice that acknowledges teen agency (picking timing, taking responsibility)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers ('Before the conversation:', 'During the talk:', 'Remember:') breaks conversational flow",
      "Advice sections use impersonal instructional language ('Think about...', 'Have a plan...') rather than first-person suggestions ('I'd suggest...', 'You could try...')",
      "Loses the warm, conversational tone established in the opening once it switches to list format"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end is perfectly natural, specific to the situation, and invites continued conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The response is structured like a self-help article with three separate bulleted sections and headers, rather than flowing prose that feels like texting a friend",

      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response contains three distinct header sections with bullet lists (Before/During/Remember), making it feel like a checklist rather than a conversation. Only the opening and closing sentences are true prose."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 1-2 flowing paragraphs using first-person suggestions like 'I'd probably start by thinking about what led to the grade...' or 'When you talk to them, I'd suggest being honest upfront...'",
      "Maintain the conversational warmth from the opening throughout the advice section instead of switching to instructional mode",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to match the casual, supportive tone"
