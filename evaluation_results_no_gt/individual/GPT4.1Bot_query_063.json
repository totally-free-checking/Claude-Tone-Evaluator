    "strengths": [
      "Exceptional first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'I’d probably', 'I’m pretty sure') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation that names physical sensations ('The way your stomach just drops instantly—ugh') making the teen feel truly seen",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question, while natural, combines two scenarios which could potentially be simplified to one focused question",
      "Practical advice section is somewhat brief—could include one additional specific coping strategy for the immediate aftermath"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The conversational tone and first-person language usage perfectly captures the 'supportive older sibling' voice, using casual markers like 'ugh', 'sooo', and 'But for real' without sounding forced",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The response is slightly on the shorter side (4 paragraphs), which while appropriate for the query, leaves minimal room for additional nuance or alternative scenarios",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or lists. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using phrases like 'If it ever happens again...' rather than structured recommendations."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more specific grounding technique for immediate embarrassment (like a quick breathing exercise or self-talk phrase) to round out the practical advice",
      "The follow-up question could be simplified to focus on just one aspect (e.g., 'Did you find the right room okay?' or 'Are you worried about doing it again?') rather than the binary choice, though the current version is still natural"
