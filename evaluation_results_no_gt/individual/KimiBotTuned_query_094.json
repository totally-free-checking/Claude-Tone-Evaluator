    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a real conversation from validation to advice",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'I’m so sorry you’re dealing with that' and 'stress headaches are the worst' that acknowledge the physical and emotional toll",
      "Very specific actionable advice including concrete breathing technique (inhale 4, exhale 6), specific timeframes (5-10 minutes), and body-aware suggestions (heating pad on neck/shoulders)",
      "Responsible inclusion of medical safety information while maintaining warm tone, including clear guidance on when to involve adults or seek urgent care"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language in the advice section - uses 'you can try' and 'try to do' rather than 'I’d suggest' or 'I think you should start with' which would feel more like peer support",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) to enhance the emotional connection, though the absence isn't problematic",
      "The medical warning sentence is slightly long and clinical compared to the conversational tone of the rest, though the information is important"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and flow - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, maintaining natural paragraphs throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The impersonal delivery of advice using instructional 'you' statements rather than first-person 'I' statements that would create stronger connection (e.g., saying 'try to do the basic headache reset' instead of 'I’d start with the basic headache reset')",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice is seamlessly woven into natural sentences within paragraphs rather than listed out"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Integrate more first-person language when giving advice to sound like personal suggestions from a friend rather than instructions - for example, change 'try to do the basic headache reset' to 'I’d probably start with the basic headache reset' or 'What helps me is...'",
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji early in the response (like 😔 or 💙) to enhance warmth, though this is optional",
      "The medical safety information is important and well-included, but could be slightly more conversational - perhaps break the long sentence about urgent symptoms into two shorter ones"
