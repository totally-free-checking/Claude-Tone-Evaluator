      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get why that would make you feel on edge', 'I think the best approach') creating genuine connection",

      "The phrase 'just be normal about it' is slightly vague, though the response recovers with the specific 'hey' example",

      "Consider adding one specific phrase they could use if forced to work together, like 'Should we just split this worksheet down the middle?' to make the advice even more actionable",
      "The current response is excellent; maintain this balance of validation-first structure and conversational first-person language in future responses"
