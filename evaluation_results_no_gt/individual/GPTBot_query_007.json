    "strengths": [
      "Provides extremely specific and actionable advice including exact message templates the teen can copy/paste to their partner and instructor",
      "Follow-up questions are highly specific to the situation (asking about assignment type, required parts, current progress) rather than generic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses 'you should' instead of 'I think you should' or 'I'd probably'",
      "Heavy use of headers (##), numbered lists (1-6), and bullet points creates a clinical wiki-style format rather than conversational prose",
      "Minimal emotional validation - only one brief sentence ('That's super stressful') before immediately jumping to 6 structured action steps",
      "Ends with a numbered list of questions (1, 2, 3) rather than a natural conversational question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality is exemplary with realistic, immediately actionable steps including specific scripts for communicating with the partner and documentation strategies",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is almost entirely structured lists and headers rather than natural prose paragraphs, making it feel like a productivity manual rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 15,
      "prose_percentage": "10%",
      "notes": "Uses extensive formatting including headers (## 1)), numbered lists (1-6), bullet points (-), bold text (**), and blockquote formatting (>) which creates a highly structured, article-like appearance with virtually no natural paragraph flow"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the response as 2-3 natural paragraphs instead of numbered sections - flow the advice into sentences like 'I think tonight you should focus on...' rather than '1) Triage tonight:'",
      "Add first-person language throughout like 'I'd probably send something like...' or 'I think the best approach is...' to create connection",
      "Start with more emotional validation like 'Ugh, that's honestly the worst feeling when you're staring down a deadline and doing all the work yourself' before giving advice",
      "End with a single natural question like 'What part of the project are you most worried about finishing tonight?' instead of a numbered list of questions"
