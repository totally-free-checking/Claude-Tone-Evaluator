      "Excellent specific actionable advice with concrete techniques like the '2-minute unfreeze' and 'first domino' methods that are realistic for overwhelmed teens",
      "Strong follow-up question that shows genuine interest and offers specific personalized help by asking for assignment details"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on numbered lists and bullet points makes it read like a productivity manual rather than a supportive conversation - uses headers, bold text, and structured formatting throughout",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - uses imperative instructional tone ('Set a timer', 'Choose one') instead of personal connection ('I'd suggest', 'When I get stuck')",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping to solutions - only 'Totally been there' before immediately shifting to cognitive strategies"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers specific, realistic techniques (2-minute rule, 10-minute chunks, environment hacks) that are immediately actionable for teens",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose vs bullets - the response is structured as 4 numbered sections with multiple sub-bullet points, reading like a wikiHow article rather than natural conversational prose",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice as natural conversational paragraphs instead of numbered lists - flow the suggestions together using transitions like 'I'd probably start by...' or 'Something that helps me is...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - use phrases like 'I get stuck like this too', 'I find that when my brain freezes', or 'I'd suggest trying...' instead of imperative commands",
      "Expand the emotional validation section before giving advice - acknowledge the anxiety and overwhelm more fully with something like 'That panicky frozen feeling is the worst' before moving to solutions"
