    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with no bullet points or over-structuring - reads as a natural text message",
      "Opens with immediate validation ('That's a really tough feeling') and normalizes the experience ('more common than you might think')",
      "Asks a specific, relevant follow-up question about triggers rather than a generic 'how are you?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses 'Sometimes it helps' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest', making it feel impersonal and clinical",
      "Uses therapeutic jargon like 'emotional disconnection' and 'identify patterns' rather than casual teen-friendly language like 'feeling on the outside' or 'noticing when it happens'",
      "Too brief and terse at only one paragraph - feels rushed rather than supportive"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or headers - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and language - reads like a therapist or self-help article rather than a supportive friend due to zero first-person pronouns and clinical phrasing",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect formatting choice with pure prose, though the content itself feels more like a mini-therapy session than a casual conversation"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout: change 'Sometimes it helps to identify patterns' to 'I'd try to notice when it happens most' or 'I think looking for patterns might help'",
      "Replace clinical terms with casual language: instead of 'emotional disconnection,' try 'when the vibes are off' or 'feeling like you're on the outside looking in'",
      "Expand to 2-3 paragraphs with more warmth - add something like 'Ugh, that's such a lonely feeling 💙 I've definitely been there' before getting into the advice"
