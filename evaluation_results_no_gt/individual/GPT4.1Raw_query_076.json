    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as conversational paragraphs",
      "Strong balance between emotional validation ('It sounds tough to feel that way') and practical reframing of what having a 'thing' means",
      "Appropriate length with 4 focused paragraphs that are substantial but not overwhelming for mobile reading"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - missing 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I've been there' which makes it feel like an article rather than a supportive friend texting",
      "Validation feels slightly detached/generalized ('A lot of people worry') rather than personally empathetic ('Ugh, I know that feeling' or 'That insecurity is the worst')",
      "No emoji usage - while not required, a single warm emoji like 💙 or 😅 could enhance the supportive tone for this vulnerable topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - maintains perfect conversational paragraph flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone lacking first-person connection - reads like general advice rather than a supportive friend sharing personal perspective ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it')",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect execution of prose format. Response uses natural paragraph breaks without any bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective to create connection: open with something like 'Ugh, I totally get that feeling' or 'I remember stressing about this exact thing' instead of general statements about 'a lot of people'",
      "Use 'I think' or 'I'd say' when offering advice - for example change 'It can help to try new activities' to 'I'd say try sampling a few new activities' or 'I think it helps to...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 💙 or 😅) to immediately signal friendly, casual support for this vulnerable admission"
