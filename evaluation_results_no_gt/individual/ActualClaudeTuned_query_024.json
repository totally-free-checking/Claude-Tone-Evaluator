    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get why that would hurt', 'I think you could casually bring it up', 'I'd try not to overthink it') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with an older sibling",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing ('saw you guys hung out yesterday, looked fun!') that a teen could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to normalization ('Honestly, this happens way more than people talk about') could potentially feel slightly minimizing to a very sensitive teen, though the intent is clearly to comfort",
      "Could include one more explicitly validating phrase like 'You have every right to feel hurt' before moving to the 'it might not be intentional' perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and perfect emoji restraint (single 💙 placed early to set warm tone)",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly rapid shift from emotional validation to rationalization/normalization - could linger on the 'that sucks' feeling for one more sentence before explaining why it happens",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more beat of pure validation like 'That really sucks and you're allowed to feel hurt about it' before moving to the 'this happens to everyone' perspective",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but you could add 'I'm here to talk more about it if you need' to reinforce the supportive relationship"
