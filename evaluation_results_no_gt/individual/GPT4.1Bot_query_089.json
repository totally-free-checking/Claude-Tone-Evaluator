    "strengths": [
      "Exceptional use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get what you mean', 'I've absolutely been there', 'If I were you, I'd') creating authentic peer-like connection rather than distant advisor tone",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading exactly like a natural text conversation with natural transitions between thoughts",
      "Immediate and sustained emotional validation ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling!', 'it's way more normal than anyone admits') before offering any solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Absence of emojis when one might enhance warmth (like 😅 or 😊) though the text alone remains warm",
      "The transition into advice could benefit from a slightly softer bridge phrase like 'Here's what helps me' before 'If I were you' though this is minor"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, maintaining conversational flow throughout the entire response",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - completely absent when including one supportive emoji could have visually reinforced the warm, casual tone",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with natural conversational flow. No bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text used. Advice is integrated naturally into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to visually reinforce the supportive tone, though the current text-only approach is still effective",
      "The advice section is slightly dense; consider breaking the third paragraph after 'keep going' to create more white space for mobile readability"
