    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I'm sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word scripts the teen can actually use ('Why does everything have to be a contest with you?' and the direct conversation opener)",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to explaining the friend's psychology ('Sometimes they're trying to feel better about themselves') happens quickly and could slightly dilute the emotional support",
      "Could benefit from one more explicit validating statement like 'You're not alone in this' before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, using 'I think', 'I'd say', and casual contractions throughout without any corporate or clinical language",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The balance slightly favors advice over emotional validation, with only one paragraph of validation before moving into explanations and solutions",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, or bullet points. Uses italicization for emphasis ('so') which enhances conversational tone without breaking prose flow"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure validation before explaining why the friend might act this way",
      "The follow-up question is good but could be even more open-ended by removing the examples, though the specificity does show active listening"
