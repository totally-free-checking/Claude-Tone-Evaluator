    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, strong emotional validation ('Oh man, I totally get why that might feel overwhelming!') that mirrors the teen's anxiety about being rushed",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use with parents ('I appreciate that you want to help me plan ahead, but talking about college right now feels pretty overwhelming...')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural conversational flow - reads like a supportive older sibling texting, with no structural formatting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) to enhance the casual, friendly tone at the opening",
      "The perspective shift to 'your parents probably just want to help' in paragraph 2, while balanced, could potentially stay in the teen's emotional experience slightly longer before offering the reframe"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - maintains conversational flow throughout while embedding practical advice within sentences rather than lists",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly limited first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest') - uses 'You could try' rather than 'I'd suggest trying' which would create stronger personal connection",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one warm emoji (like 😅) after the opening validation to immediately signal casual, friendly support",
      "Replace 'You could try telling them' with 'I'd suggest telling them' or 'I think you could try' to strengthen the first-person connection and make it feel more like personal advice from a friend",
      "Consider adding 'I'm here if you need to talk more about it' or similar first-person supportive closing before the question to reinforce availability"
