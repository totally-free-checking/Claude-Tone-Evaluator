    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling') that immediately acknowledges the 'brain freeze' experience",
      "Provides excellent specific actionable strategies (the '2-minute cheat,' 'chaos method,' changing location) that are realistic and immediately usable for a teen"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured bullet points with bold formatting and headers instead of natural prose paragraphs - reads more like a listicle than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd suggest,' 'I get it') - uses imperative 'you should' style which feels more instructional than supportive",
      "Excessive emoji usage (4 emojis) exceeds the ideal 0-1 max and contributes to the listicle formatting"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, creative, and realistic strategies specifically tailored to assignment paralysis that a teen could actually implement right now",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose vs bullet formatting - uses a header ('Some options to break the freeze:') followed by 4 heavily formatted bullets with emojis and bold text, which is the opposite of the natural paragraph flow ideal",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response starts with 2 paragraphs of prose but then shifts to a heavily structured list format with a header, bold text labels for each option, and emojis. The advice is delivered entirely through bullet points rather than woven into conversational narrative."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose paragraphs - instead of listing 'The 2-minute cheat,' 'Eat the snack,' etc. as separate bullets, weave them naturally into conversation like 'I'd probably start by just opening all the documents without any pressure to write, or maybe try what I call the chaos method where you rotate between assignments...'",
      "Add first-person perspective to create connection: replace 'You just have to trick your brain' with 'I think the key is tricking your brain' or 'I'd suggest trying to trick your brain' to sound more like a supportive friend sharing personal advice rather than an instruction manual",
      "Reduce emojis from 4 to 0-1 max, and remove the bold formatting and header to maintain the conversational text-message feel rather than a formatted self-help article"
