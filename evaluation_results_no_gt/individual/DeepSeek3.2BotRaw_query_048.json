    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling', 'It's completely valid to feel this way')",
      "Specific, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the details ('Like, who's doing the comparing, or what it is they're saying?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Complete absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') makes the response feel impersonal despite casual vocabulary",
      "Follow-up question appears in the middle of the response rather than at the end, closing with validation instead of engagement",
      "Lacks concrete practical advice or actionable strategies beyond vague 'naming it helps' - no specific scripts for talking to parents or coping mechanisms"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero bullet points, reading like a text message rather than a structured guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The complete lack of first-person singular pronouns (I, me, my) - the response never says 'I think' or 'I'd feel the same way', creating distance rather than the intended supportive peer connection",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Uses italics once for emphasis on 'you' which enhances the conversational tone without breaking flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: try 'I totally get why that sucks' or 'I'd be so frustrated too' instead of only using 'you' statements",
      "Move the engaging question to the very end of the response to invite continued conversation rather than closing with a statement",
      "Include specific, actionable advice such as example phrases to say to parents ('I've been feeling compared a lot and it hurts') or concrete coping strategies for when comparisons happen"
