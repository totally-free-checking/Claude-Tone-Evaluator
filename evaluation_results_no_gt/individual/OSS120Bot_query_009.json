      "Immediate emotional validation with specific feeling words ('awkward feeling', 'mix of nervous and maybe even a little betrayed') that acknowledge the emotional weight of the situation",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd try pulling them aside', 'I can totally see why') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic conversation script ('I noticed you've been acting different lately—did I do something that made you uneasy?') that gives the teen concrete words to use"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The suggestion for a 'schedule for checking in on each other's phone use' might be slightly optimistic for families with trust issues, though it's presented as an optional boundary-setting idea",
      "Could acknowledge the 'betrayed' feeling a bit more deeply before moving to reassurance, though it does mention it"

      "Consider lingering a moment longer on the validation of feeling betrayed or invaded before offering the 'it's not catastrophic' reassurance",
      "The boundary-setting suggestion is good, but could acknowledge that not all parents are open to mutual agreements, offering an alternative for stricter family dynamics"
