      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and visceral language like 'anxious, stomach-drop feeling' that makes the teen feel truly seen",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use like 'Yeah, I just felt like changing it up' and suggests realistic strategies like debuting changes around supportive friends",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could strengthen first-person connection in the second paragraph by adding 'I think' or 'In my experience' before 'people comment way less' to better match the ideal character's natural use of 'I think', 'I'd say' language",

      "Add first-person framing to observations like changing 'Honestly, people comment way less' to 'Honestly, I think people comment way less' or 'In my experience, people comment way less' to strengthen the personal, conversational connection",
