    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and acknowledgment of the 'awful feeling' of friend conflict",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd probably try', 'I noticed') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for the conversation including exact phrasing a teen could use",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, reading like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for awkward situations, might slightly understate the emotional weight for some users compared to warmer alternatives",
      "The boundary-setting comment about 'if they're being really unreasonable' comes somewhat abruptly after the supportive script"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language usage - consistently uses 'I think', 'I'd say', and natural contractions throughout, sounding exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor emoji choice - while not incorrect, the 😅 (nervous sweat) emoji emphasizes the awkwardness rather than pure warmth/support, though this is a very minor deviation",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph form with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using a heart or supportive emoji (💙 or 😊) alongside or instead of 😅 to emphasize care over awkwardness, though the current choice works for the situation",
      "The boundary-setting advice about unreasonable behavior is valuable but could be softened with a phrase like 'At the same time, remember that...' to transition more smoothly from the supportive script"
