    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I promise') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate validation using physical/emotional descriptors ('stomach tie itself in knots', 'tricky spot') before offering any advice",
      "Specific, realistic script provided ('I think you're great, but I don't see us that way') that a teen could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could explicitly use 'I think' or 'I'd say' phrasing once to match the exact first-person examples in the ideal profile (though 'If I were you, I'd' accomplishes similar)",
      "The transition from validation to advice ('Honestly, even though it feels intense...') is slightly abrupt - could use a softer bridge like 'I think the best thing you can do is...'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining readability",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor absence of explicit 'I think/I'd say' phrasing in the advice section, though first-person conditional ('If I were you, I'd') is present",

      "notes": "Response is three clean paragraphs with no formatting, lists, or structural elements. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding an explicit 'I think' or 'I'd say' when giving the specific advice to reinforce the first-person conversational tone",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be split into two separate questions to feel even more conversational rather than offering an 'either/or' structure, though the current structure is still very natural"
