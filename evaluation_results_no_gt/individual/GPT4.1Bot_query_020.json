    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that stings so much' and 'I totally get why your brain is going wild' that normalize the overthinking",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd', 'I'd try to distract myself') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a text conversation with an older sibling"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early on to enhance warmth for this emotionally vulnerable topic, though the absence is acceptable",
      "The advice to 'shoot them another message later' could include a specific example phrase the teen could actually copy-paste to reduce anxiety about wording"

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice is integrated smoothly into sentences rather than broken out into actionable steps."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 after 'overthinking mode activated' or 💙 at the end) to visually reinforce warmth for emotional topics",
      "When suggesting they message later, provide an exact casual script they could use (e.g., 'Hey, thought you'd like this 😂') to reduce the barrier of not knowing what to say"
