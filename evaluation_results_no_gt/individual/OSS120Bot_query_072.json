    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I feel you', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific physical description ('stomach drops', 'planning all the ways you could just disappear') that shows deep understanding of teen embarrassment",
      "Provides concrete, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('Okay, let's see if we can survive this without tripping')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother - moves quickly from 'people have been there' to practical tips",
      "The advice to 'make eye contact' might be challenging for someone experiencing intense embarrassment and could acknowledge that difficulty more"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and consistent first-person conversational voice that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance in the follow-up question which asks two things at once (music preference AND whether it's random gym beats), though both are natural",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or structured formatting. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using phrases like 'If I were you, I'd try to keep it simple' rather than bullet points."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of validation between the reassurance ('most people have been there') and the advice section to create a softer transition",
      "The follow-up question could be slightly more open-ended or singular - instead of asking about music quality and preference in one breath, maybe 'What song are you dancing to? I'm curious if it's something decent or total gym-class randomness'"
