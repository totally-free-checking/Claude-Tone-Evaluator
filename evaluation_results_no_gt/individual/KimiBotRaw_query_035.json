    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation that normalizes the struggle of pretending to be fine: 'And the whole 'smiling through it' thing? Honestly exhausting. You don't actually have to be fine right now if you're not.'",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, flowing like a conversational text message between friends",
      "Excellent follow-up question that offers two specific, natural options: 'Want to talk about what happened, or would you rather just have someone confirm that yes, this absolutely sucks...'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') that would make the response feel like a specific supportive friend sharing their perspective rather than general wisdom",
      "Absence of any emoji when one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) could enhance the casual, supportive tone at the opening"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow without any bullet points, lists, or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person 'I' statements despite otherwise casual tone, making it feel slightly impersonal compared to a friend saying 'I get how hard that is'",

      "Add first-person perspective statements to increase personal connection, such as 'I think the acting fine part is especially tough' or 'I'd probably want to hide too if that happened to me'",
      "Consider including one warm, casual emoji at the start (like 😅) or end (like 💙) to immediately signal the supportive, informal tone"
