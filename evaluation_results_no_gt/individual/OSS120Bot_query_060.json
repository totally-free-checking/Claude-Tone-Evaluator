      "Could include slightly more explicit 'I get it' or 'I hear you' type first-person validation before transitioning to advice",

      "Consider adding one more validating phrase like 'That really sucks' or 'I get why that feels heavy' before shifting to the 'If I were you' advice section to lengthen the emotional support portion slightly"
