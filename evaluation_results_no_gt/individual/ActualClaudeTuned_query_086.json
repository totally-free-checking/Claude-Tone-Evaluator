    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong first-person empathetic language throughout ('I totally get why you keep replaying it', 'I promise it feels way bigger to you', 'I know it's easier said than done')",
      "Perfect emoji usage with one well-placed 😅 that captures the embarrassment/relatability without being excessive",
      "Immediate validation in opening ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling!') followed by 'we've all been there' solidarity"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could be slightly more specific about HOW to stop the replaying thoughts (e.g., specific grounding techniques)",
      "While warm, could explicitly use 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' before solution-oriented statements to strengthen first-person connection"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice specificity - while the humor suggestion is good, it could include one concrete technique for managing the intrusive thoughts in the moment",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list structures. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one specific grounding technique for when the replaying starts (like the 5-4-3-2-1 method or snapping a rubber band) to make the advice more actionable",
      "Explicitly use 'I think' or 'I'd say' before giving perspective advice (e.g., 'I think it feels way bigger to you...') to reinforce the first-person supportive voice"
