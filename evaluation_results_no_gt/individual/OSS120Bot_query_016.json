    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong specific advice including the exact script to text the coach ('Hey, I just realized I have practice now...') and realistic suggestions like makeup drills",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable metaphors ('that sudden rush... is the worst', 'your brain just hit the snooze button')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective in the advice section - uses impersonal constructions like 'It might also help' and 'usually works' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think'",
      "Could include a brief supportive closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk' before the question to reinforce the supportive relationship"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with embedded advice - perfectly avoids bullet points and lists while maintaining conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Impersonal advisory voice in the solution section - missing first-person language like 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' that would make it feel more like personal guidance from a friend",

      "Include a brief personal support statement before the question, such as 'I'm here if you want to talk through how to reschedule things' to strengthen the first-person connection"
