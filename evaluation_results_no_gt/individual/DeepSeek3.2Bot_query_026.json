    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm sorry—that 'we need to talk about your attitude' talk is the worst' that perfectly captures the teen's frustration and makes them feel understood",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were in your shoes', 'I'd try') creating genuine connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts like 'Can you give me an example of what you mean?' that the teen can actually use in the conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'feel way bigger and more dramatic in your head' could potentially minimize the teen's feelings before pivoting to blame the parent",
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for awkwardness, might not fully match the 'annoyed' emotion expressed in the query—a warmer emoji or none might better validate their frustration"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points, creating a seamless conversational flow that reads exactly like texting with a supportive friend rather than a self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight minimization in the second paragraph where it suggests the talks feel bigger 'in your head' before clarifying it's the parent's fault building things up",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect paragraph structure with four natural prose blocks; no headers, bold text, numbered lists, or bullet points; advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider validating the specific emotion of annoyance/anger a bit more explicitly before the reframing about parents building things up to avoid any hint of minimization",
      "The 😅 emoji works for the awkwardness of the situation, but a 💙 might better convey warmth and support for an annoyed teen, or consider no emoji to match their frustration level"
