      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Oh no, that's the worst feeling!' and 'Ugh, I'm sorry you had to deal with that' that make the teen feel instantly understood",
      "Specific, actionable scripts provided for exactly what to say ('I need a second to think about that' and 'I'm blanking right now—can I circle back to this later?') that are realistic for a school setting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions rather than one focused question, which slightly dilutes the conversational flow ('How did you end up handling it? Did anything specific trigger the blank-out?')",
      "Could incorporate more first-person 'I' statements in the advice section (e.g., 'I'd suggest...') to strengthen the personal connection, though it does use 'I promise' and 'I'm sorry' effectively"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a formal advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up section asks two questions back-to-back rather than a single engaging question, making it feel slightly more like an interview than a natural conversation flow",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural conversational paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Uses italics sparingly for emphasis on 'everyone' which is acceptable and enhances tone without breaking prose flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider condensing the final two questions into one natural follow-up like 'How did you end up handling it, and was there something specific that triggered the blank-out?' to maintain the conversational feel",
      "Add one or two more first-person perspective statements in the advice section such as 'I'd probably say something like...' or 'I think the key is...' to reinforce that this is a personal response from a supportive peer rather than generic advice"
