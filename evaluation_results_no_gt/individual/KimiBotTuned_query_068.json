    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as a conversation with 4 well-structured paragraphs",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, I'm really sorry' and acknowledging the stress of feeling an adult is 'against you'",
      "Highly specific and realistic advice including exact script wording ('Hey, can I ask something? I feel like I've been getting on your nerves...') and practical logistics ('catch them for like 30 seconds after class')",
      "Excellent follow-up question that gives specific categories (something they said, grading, way they act) to help the teen pinpoint the issue"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language from the bot's perspective - missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' which would create stronger personal connection",
      "Could explicitly validate shared experience more directly (e.g., 'We've all been there' or 'I remember feeling this way') rather than just 'It's super easy to...'",
      "The emoji 😅, while appropriate for the 'tense' feeling, could be supplemented with a warmer tone-setting phrase to ensure the validation lands before the nervous laughter emoji"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language usage - the bot validates with 'I'm sorry' but doesn't use 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it' to share personal perspective or stance on the advice given",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out. Uses em-dashes and parentheses naturally for asides."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to advice sections, such as 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd suggest trying...' to make it feel more like personal guidance from a friend rather than general suggestions",
      "Consider adding an explicit 'You're not alone' or 'We've all had that one teacher' validation to strengthen the shared experience aspect before moving to solutions",
      "Could end with 'I'm here if you need to talk more about this' or similar to reinforce the supportive relationship"
