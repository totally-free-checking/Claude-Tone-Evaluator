    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate validation with relatable language: 'Ugh, that spiral feeling after being left on read by your crush is the absolute worst - it's like your brain just won't stop replaying the message over and over'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout: 'I totally get why it's messing with you', 'If I were you, I'd try', and 'we've all been there' creates genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing: 'hey, just checking in - everything good?' which gives the teen a concrete script to use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to perspective ('Honestly, it feels way bigger in the moment than it probably is') could slightly soften the validation before offering the reframe, though it does acknowledge the feeling",
      "The follow-up question, while specific, assumes they want to share the content rather than asking how they're feeling now, which could feel slightly investigative rather than supportive depending on the teen's state"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - the response flows as conversational paragraphs with advice embedded naturally within sentences rather than listed out",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The emoji choice (💙), while appropriately placed and singular, is slightly generic compared to more situation-specific options like 😅 or no emoji, though this is a minor deviation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. The advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs, reading like a text from a supportive friend rather than a structured self-help guide."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue maintaining the strong first-person presence with phrases like 'If I were you' and 'I'd say' - this creates the essential 'supportive friend' dynamic",
      "Consider slightly extending the pure validation phase before offering perspective that the situation 'feels way bigger than it is' to ensure the teen feels fully heard before any reframing occurs"
