    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts for follow-up texts (e.g., 'Hey, did you end up seeing this? No worries if you got busy') that are realistic and non-desperate",
      "Offers concrete time-based guidance (<24 hours, 1-2 days, 3+ days) that gives teens clear benchmarks for action",
      "The reality check section acknowledges multiple possibilities without being dismissive of the pain"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with headers (###), bold text, and bullet points throughout - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal instructional tone throughout",
      "Asks four questions at the end which feels like an interrogation or intake form rather than a natural conversation starter",
      "Uses clinical psychological terminology ('threat-scanning', 'adrenaline loop', 'rumination', 'anxious attachment triggers') that feels clinical rather than warm",
      "Jumps from brief validation immediately into structured 'steps' and 'plans' without maintaining emotional connection"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific text message scripts and timeframes are exactly what a spiraling teen needs, just delivered in the wrong format",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - the response is formatted like a wikiHow article with headers, subheaders, bold text, and multiple bullet lists instead of conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 18,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses ### headers for 6 sections, bold text for emphasis throughout, and extensive bullet lists. Only the opening sentence is true prose. Reads as a structured guide rather than a supportive message."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the structured sections into 2-3 natural paragraphs flowing from validation to advice - remove all ### headers and bullet points",
      "Add first-person empathetic language like 'I get how much this sucks' or 'I've definitely stared at my phone waiting for a text too' to create personal connection",
      "Reduce the four questions at the end to one natural follow-up like 'How long has it been since you sent the text?' instead of the numbered list",
      "Remove clinical terms like 'threat-scanning' and 'adrenaline loop' - replace with casual language like 'your brain is spiraling' or 'that anxious feeling'",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a supportive tone without being excessive"
