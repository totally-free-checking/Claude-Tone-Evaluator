    "strengths": [
      "Exceptional use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd message...', 'I'd also start finishing...') creating a genuine peer-to-peer supportive tone",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts and templates the teen can literally copy-paste ('Hey, it's due tomorrow—what can you finish tonight...', 'Can you do slides 4–6 and send by 9pm?')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive text from an older sibling"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question combines two distinct questions ('What kind of project is it... and have you already texted them...') which slightly dilutes the focus, though it remains conversational",
      "Could include one additional validating phrase immediately before the advice paragraph to create an even stronger emotional buffer, though the transition is already quite smooth"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The compound follow-up question at the end, while natural, slightly splits the conversational focus by asking about both project type and communication status simultaneously",

      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining a conversational text-message feel throughout."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider separating the final question into a single focused inquiry or ensuring the compound question flows as one cohesive thought (which it mostly does)",
      "The validation is strong but could be slightly extended with one more empathetic phrase like 'I know that panic feeling' right before diving into the practical steps to create an even softer transition"
