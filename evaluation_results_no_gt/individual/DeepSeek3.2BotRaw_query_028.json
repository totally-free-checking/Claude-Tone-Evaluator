    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Perfect emoji usage with exactly one well-placed 😊 that enhances warmth without being excessive or corporate",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I'm here to listen','We can also talk') creating genuine personal connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation recognizing the user is considerate for worrying about their words, and normalizing the experience with 'it happens to all of us'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing a specific follow-up question at the end; concludes with a statement ('We've all had moments...') rather than an engaging question to continue the conversation",
      "Practical advice is entirely deferred ('we can also talk about what you could do next') rather than offering even one small actionable suggestion for the immediate situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, numbered lists, or over-structuring, maintaining perfect conversational flow across three readable paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - completely fails to end with a question that would invite the teen to share more details about what happened",

      "notes": "Response uses three clean paragraphs with zero bullet points, headers, bold text, or other formatting structures. Advice and validation flow naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "End with a specific, natural question like 'What exactly happened?' or 'Who was it with?' to invite the teen to share more and continue the conversation",
      "Consider offering one small immediate actionable tip (such as suggesting they send a quick clarifying text) while still leaving room for them to share more details for deeper advice"
