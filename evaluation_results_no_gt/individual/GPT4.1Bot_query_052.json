    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'If I were you', 'I'd think', 'I promise') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, that's such a tough spot' and specific acknowledgment of guilt"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Middle paragraph slightly verbose with multiple similar reassurance phrases ('nobody really talks about', 'I promise', 'tons of people')",
      "Could benefit from one subtle emoji (like 😅) early on to enhance visual warmth, though text-only works for this serious topic"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow with consistent first-person perspective ('If I were you', 'I'd think') that makes advice feel personal rather than prescriptive",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight redundancy in the reassurance section where it repeats that 'tons of people move on' after already saying 'everyone feels like this'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the start to set visual tone, though the 'Ugh' opening effectively conveys emotion textually",
      "The advice section could be slightly condensed by removing one of the reassurance phrases to maintain momentum, though current length is acceptable"
