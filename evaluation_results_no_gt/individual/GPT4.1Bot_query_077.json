    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with specific language like 'that anxious, what if I mess this up feeling is totally real' and the relatable metaphor of 'carrying someone else's emotional backpack'",
      "Strong use of first-person perspective with 'I think the most important thing here is listening to your gut' creating a personal connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use like 'Hey, this is a lot for me too, but I care about you' and clear guidance on when to break confidentiality for safety"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from an additional first-person supportive closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk more' to reinforce the supportive relationship",
      "While the absence of emojis is appropriate for the serious topic, a single supportive emoji like 💙 could potentially enhance warmth without undermining gravity"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and conversational flow that reads like a supportive friend texting rather than a formal advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Could slightly strengthen the first-person supportive presence with phrases like 'I'd say' or 'I get it' or an explicit 'I'm here for you' statement to deepen the personal connection",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one brief first-person supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk more' to reinforce the bot's presence as a supportive entity",
      "For serious topics like potential safety concerns, the current emoji-free approach is appropriate and respectful, so maintain this restraint rather than adding casual emojis"
