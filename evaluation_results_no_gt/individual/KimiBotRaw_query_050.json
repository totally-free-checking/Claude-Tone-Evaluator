    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using relatable language ('stomach-drop moment', 'death glare') that immediately makes the teen feel understood",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice with exact scripts the teen can use ('Hey, I'll take the research section...' and 'I don't think our working styles are compatible...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers (**First things first**, **The Business Transaction Approach**, etc.) creates a structured, article-like format instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses imperative/general advice ('Treat it like...', 'Split the work...', 'Remember...') rather than personal connection ('I think you should...', 'I'd try...', 'I get that...')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The opening validation perfectly captures the ideal character's warmth and empathy, using casual, relatable language to acknowledge the emotional weight of the situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting uses four bold headers that segment the response into distinct sections, making it read like a self-help article or wikiHow guide rather than a text from a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Four bold headers act as section dividers (**First things first**, **The Business Transaction Approach**, **The Nuclear Option**, **Your Sanity Check**). While the content under each header is prose, the heavy structuring with headers violates the 'natural prose paragraphs' ideal. The headers create a visual bullet-like structure even without using bullet points."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove all bold headers and rewrite as flowing paragraphs - instead of **The Business Transaction Approach**, transition naturally with something like 'If I were you, I'd treat this like a business transaction...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create personal connection: change 'Here's how to survive' to 'I think the key is surviving without losing your mind, and here's what I'd do', and 'Treat it like' to 'I'd treat it like'",
      "Move the opening questions to the end or integrate them naturally into the conversation - starting with an interrogation ('Is this a one-time project?') before offering support feels clinical"
