      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd maybe try') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for the teen to use with parents ('I'm open to talking about what's out there, but I'm not ready to commit to anything yet')",
      "Perfect emoji usage with single 😅 at opening that captures the 'yikes, too soon' feeling without being excessive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question uses an em-dash which creates a slight pause; could flow more conversationally as two separate sentences or a simpler structure",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text message from a friend",

      "Consider splitting the final question into two shorter sentences for even more conversational flow: 'What do you think is making them bring it up so soon? Are they just worried, or is there a specific reason?'",
      "Could add one more validating phrase like 'That pressure sucks' or 'You shouldn't have to deal with that yet' to strengthen the emotional acknowledgment before moving to advice"
