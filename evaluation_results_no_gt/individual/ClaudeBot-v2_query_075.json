      "Immediate emotional validation using relatable physical language like 'stomach-flippy situation' that captures teen anxiety perfectly",
      "Zero bullet points with pure conversational prose that flows naturally like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact conversation starters ('How do you know [host]?') and realistic strategies like the '45-minute out'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could strengthen explicit first-person connection with statements like 'I've totally been there' or 'I get it' beyond the single 'I'd try'",

      "Add one or two explicit first-person validation statements like 'I remember feeling exactly this way' or 'I get how nerve-wracking that is' to strengthen the personal, supportive bond",
      "Consider focusing the follow-up question on one aspect (either the event type or the relationship to the host) to make it easier for the teen to answer and continue the conversation naturally"
