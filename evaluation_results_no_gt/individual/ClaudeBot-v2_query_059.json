    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I were you') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I've noticed I'm usually the one starting convos—can you hit me up sometimes too?')",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such a crappy feeling') acknowledging the confidence impact before offering solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched with 'crappy feeling' as it typically conveys nervous laughter rather than empathy for a difficult emotion",
      "Could include slightly more validation about the specific fear of rejection or loneliness before jumping to the 'pull back' strategy"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 💙 or 😔 instead of 😅 for 'crappy feeling' to better match the empathetic tone, or omit the emoji entirely since the 'Ugh' already conveys the sentiment",
      "The advice to 'pull back' is good but could be softened with a bit more validation about how scary that might feel, since teens often fear losing friends entirely when they stop initiating"
