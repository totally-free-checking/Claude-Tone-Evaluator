      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers (**Immediate action**, **Know your rights**) instead of natural prose paragraphs",

      "Remove corporate-style headers like 'Immediate action' and 'Know your rights' which feel like a wikiHow article rather than texting with a supportive friend"
