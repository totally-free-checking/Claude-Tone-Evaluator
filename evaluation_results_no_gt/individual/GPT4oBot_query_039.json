      "Immediate emotional validation with specific empathetic language like 'Ugh, I'm so sorry—you've got so much on your plate already, and that kind of pressure can feel like it's just weighing you down'",
      "Natural first-person connection throughout using 'I totally get it' and 'I'm so sorry' that makes it feel like a real person texting",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script for the conversation with parents: 'I'm working hard, but this pressure makes me feel really stressed, and it's tough to stay motivated when I feel overwhelmed'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring that reads like a natural conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions back-to-back ('Have you been able to set aside time... Or does it feel like...') which slightly violates the 'not multiple questions at once' guideline, though they flow naturally",

      "Strengthen the first-person connection in the advice paragraph by changing 'If you can, maybe try talking to them' to something like 'I think talking to them might really help' or 'I'd suggest trying to talk to them' to maintain the personal voice established in the validation section",
      "Consider combining the final two questions into one cohesive question like 'Have you been able to set aside time to just chill, or does it feel like school and grades have kinda taken over everything?' to avoid the slight awkwardness of multiple question marks while still covering both angles"
