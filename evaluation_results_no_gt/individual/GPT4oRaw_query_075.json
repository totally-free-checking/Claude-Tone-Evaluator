    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Uses first-person validation effectively ('I totally get that feeling') and provides specific, actionable conversation starters ('How do you know [the host]?')",
      "Maintains casual, conversational tone throughout with appropriate contractions and teen-accessible language"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - closes with a statement rather than engaging the user to continue the conversation",
      "Pivots quickly from validating anxiety to positive reframing ('But honestly, it could be an awesome opportunity') which slightly minimizes the nervousness",
      "Lacks a warm emoji that could have enhanced the empathetic tone for this anxiety-inducing situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains perfect conversational flow throughout",

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as three natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end such as 'What kind of event is it?' or 'Are you leaning toward going?' to keep the conversation going",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 😊) to match the 'nerve-wracking' sentiment and enhance emotional connection",
      "Spend one more sentence validating the anxiety before pivoting to the positive spin - acknowledge that it's okay to feel nervous before jumping to 'it could be awesome'"
