    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation: 'Ah, that's a really uncomfortable feeling — being in the dark about someone's frustration can leave you walking on eggshells' immediately acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Ends with an engaging, specific follow-up question: 'Want to talk about how you could bring it up, or how it's affecting you?' which invites continued conversation and shows genuine interest",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice including a specific script the teen could use: 'Hey, I've been getting the vibe that you're upset with me — if I've done something to bother you, I'd really like to know so I can make it right'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a structured bullet point list ('A few things you could consider:' followed by 4 bullets) instead of natural prose paragraphs, making it feel like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - uses 'you could' and 'you might' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest', creating distance rather than the supportive peer-like connection of 'I'm here if you need to talk'",
      "The phrase 'A few things you could consider' is impersonal and formal, framing the response as a presentation of options rather than a supportive dialogue"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end perfectly matches the ideal character - it's natural, specific to the teen's situation about the conflict, and invites them to share more about their feelings or brainstorm solutions together",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers (4 distinct bullets) completely breaks the conversational flow and reads like an instruction manual rather than a supportive text from a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response starts with one prose paragraph, then shifts to 'A few things you could consider:' followed by 4 formatted bullets with bold headers (Give them space, Find a calm moment, Reflect on recent interactions, Prepare yourself to listen), then ends with one prose sentence and a question. The bullet structure dominates the response and prevents natural conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice section as natural prose paragraphs instead of bullet points - for example, flow the suggestions together: 'I'd probably give them a little space first, but not too much. Then maybe find a calm moment to gently ask...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: replace 'A few things you could consider' with 'I think I'd probably...' or 'If I were you, I'd...' and use 'I'm here to help you figure this out' to establish supportive presence",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though this is less critical than fixing the prose structure"
