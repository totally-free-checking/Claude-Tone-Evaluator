    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with visceral language like 'stomach-clenching anxiety' and 'totally get why you're on edge' that makes the teen feel immediately seen",
      "Strong use of first-person perspective throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I promise') creating authentic connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured self-help guide"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice section could include a specific script or phrasing for how to approach the teacher about extra credit or corrections",
      "While the absence of emojis is appropriate for the anxiety topic, a single supportive emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response could enhance warmth slightly"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow - it completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining clear organization through paragraph breaks",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice section is slightly generic regarding teacher communication; it mentions 'ask for extra help' but doesn't provide the specific conversational scripts that would make a nervous teen feel more confident approaching their teacher",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. The response uses four natural paragraphs that flow from validation to reframing to advice to engagement, exactly matching the ideal conversational texting style."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a specific script for approaching the teacher, such as: 'You could say something like, Hey, I know I struggled on that test - is there any way I can do corrections or extra credit to show I understand the material?'",
      "While the tone is warm without emojis, consider if a single emoji after the opening validation (like 😅 or 💙) might enhance the supportive vibe, though the current text-only approach works well for the anxiety context"
