    },
    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable spot to be in') that acknowledges the specific anxiety of second-guessing oneself",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I'd maybe keep', 'we've all had moments') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for talking to the friend ('Hey, I just wanted to check in about your boyfriend. Is everything chill with you guys?') rather than vague 'just communicate' advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one more explicit 'I think' or 'I feel' statement to strengthen the first-person perspective in the advice section",
      "The follow-up question, while good, could be slightly more conversational by dropping the second sentence or making it more informal"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text message from a friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly limited use of explicit first-person opinion phrases ('I think', 'I feel') in the middle advice section, though 'I'd' constructions partially compensate",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the very beginning to set tone, though the absence is also appropriate for this serious topic",
      "Add one explicit 'I think' or 'In my opinion' when suggesting the distance-keeping strategy to reinforce the personal, subjective nature of the advice",
      "The follow-up question is good but could be more casual: 'What exactly made you uncomfortable?' feels slightly more natural than the current phrasing"
