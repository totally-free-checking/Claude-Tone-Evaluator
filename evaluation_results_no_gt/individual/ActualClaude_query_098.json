      "Strong immediate validation with 'Hey, that sounds really tough!' and reassurance that feelings don't make them a bad person",
      "Effectively normalizes the experience with 'way more common than you might think' and 'Hearts can be pretty messy sometimes'",
      "Good casual language and contractions throughout that avoid formality"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bulleted list of three questions which breaks the conversational prose flow significantly",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making the response feel impersonal despite casual word choice",
      "The follow-up question at the end ('Want to talk through what's going on a bit more?') is generic rather than specific to their situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The emotional validation and normalization of feelings - it successfully removes shame from the situation with warm, accepting language like 'don't be so hard on yourself' and 'Totally normal'",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The bullet point section in the middle - this creates a structured, interrogative feel rather than natural conversation, and the lack of first-person pronouns makes it feel like reading a self-help article rather than texting with a supportive friend",

      "notes": "The response contains a distinct bulleted section with three questions that interrupts the paragraph flow. These questions should be integrated naturally into prose sentences or asked as part of the conversational flow rather than listed out"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace the bullet points with natural prose flow, such as: 'I'd want to know - are you actually dating either of these people, or are these more like crushes? And what specifically is making you feel most guilty about it?'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection, such as 'I think the guilt you're feeling probably comes from...' or 'I'd say the main thing is being honest with yourself...'",
      "Make the ending question more specific to their situation, such as 'What's your gut telling you about these two people?' instead of the generic 'Want to talk more?'"
