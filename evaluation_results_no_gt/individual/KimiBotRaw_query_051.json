    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'That really sucks' and 'such a specific kind of lonely' that specifically acknowledge the 'backup friend' pain",
      "Strong use of first-person supportive language ('I'm sorry', 'I'm rooting for you') that creates genuine connection",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice tailored to the situation (saying 'I'm busy' to late-night texts, observing who notices when you pull back)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers ('It's usually not about your worth', 'You can quietly stop auditioning') instead of flowing prose paragraphs",
      "The transition 'A few things that might help, even just a little:' sets up a list format rather than integrating advice naturally into conversation",
      "Advice section uses impersonal 'You can...' statements rather than first-person suggestions like 'I'd suggest...' or 'I think you could...'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Emotional validation and warmth - immediately acknowledges the specific pain of being a 'backup' with empathetic language that makes the user feel seen and understood",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting structure - uses three distinct bullet points with bold headers instead of natural prose paragraphs, making it read more like a self-help article than a text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response starts with 2 prose paragraphs, then shifts to 3 bullet points with bold headers (e.g., '**It's usually not about your worth.**'), then ends with a prose paragraph. The bullet formatting is the primary deviation from the ideal conversational prose style."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the three bullet points into natural flowing prose paragraphs - instead of bold headers, weave the advice into sentences like 'I think it's important to remember that this usually isn't about your worth...'",
      "Replace the setup phrase 'A few things that might help, even just a little:' with a transitional sentence like 'Honestly, I've found a few things that might help...' to maintain conversational flow",
      "Add more first-person framing to the advice section, such as 'I'd suggest you try quietly stopping the auditioning...' instead of 'You can quietly stop auditioning'"
