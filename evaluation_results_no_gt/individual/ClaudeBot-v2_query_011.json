    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's so irritating') and normalizes the feeling of wanting individuality",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I just want you to hear me') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts for the conversation including follow-up responses if the friend 'plays dumb'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Moves quickly to psychological explanation ('people copy when they're insecure') which could slightly dilute the initial emotional validation",
      "The 😅 emoji after 'irritating' creates a slightly mixed signal (nervous laughter vs. frustration), though it works for the awkwardness of the situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows as conversational paragraphs that read like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Could benefit from one additional sentence of pure emotional validation before explaining the psychology behind why people copy others",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose structure with four natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-formatting. Advice is woven into narrative sentences rather than broken out into steps."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more line of validation like 'That feeling of losing your individuality is so valid' before explaining why people copy",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be slightly more open-ended by removing the examples to invite more storytelling, though the examples provided are helpful categorizations"
