    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation throughout with phrases like 'I'm so sorry - that's such a violation of your privacy' and 'I get why this feels frustrating' that acknowledge the seriousness of the situation",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend with smooth paragraph transitions",
      "Strong use of first-person language ('I think', 'I get why') that creates genuine connection and avoids impersonal advice-giving",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts like 'hey, could you take down that pic of me? I'd prefer not to have it posted' that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched for a serious privacy violation topic - it conveys nervousness/awkwardness when a more supportive emoji like 💙 or 😊 might better enhance warmth, or it could be omitted entirely",
      "The transition to 'The good news is you definitely have options here' comes quickly after validation and could potentially sit with the emotional weight of the violation a moment longer before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and consistent first-person language ('I think', 'I get it') that creates an authentic peer-support feel without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice (😅) following the phrase 'violation of your privacy' creates slight tonal dissonance for a serious boundary violation, though the quantity (1 emoji) is ideal",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is formatted entirely as natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out, perfectly matching the ideal conversational style."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using a more emotionally aligned emoji like 💙 or 😊 for serious privacy violations, or omit the emoji entirely since the prose is already warm enough without it",
      "The advice to report to platform authorities is good, but could briefly acknowledge that this might feel like a big step/escalation, validating that it's okay to feel weird about reporting a friend or acquaintance"
