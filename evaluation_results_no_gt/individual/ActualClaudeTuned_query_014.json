      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oh no, that's such an awkward position to be in!' and acknowledging the 'twisted up' feeling inside",

      "Specific actionable advice including exact script: 'hey, just so I know - is what you told me earlier something you want me to keep between us?'",

      "Could incorporate more varied first-person phrases like 'I'd say' or 'I get it' beyond just 'I think' to strengthen personal connection",

      "Incorporate more varied first-person phrases like 'I'd probably...' or 'I totally get why you'd feel...' to strengthen the personal, friend-like voice",

      "The current emoji usage (😅) is perfect - maintain this restraint of 0-1 emojis in future responses"
