    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads as natural conversational paragraphs",
      "Strong emotional validation in opening: 'I'm really sorry you're feeling this way' and 'it sounds tough to watch someone you care about change'",
      "Good balance between acknowledging feelings and offering concrete advice about talking to the friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks a follow-up question to continue the conversation - ends with statements rather than an engaging question",
      "Conversational tone is somewhat formal and tentative ('It's normal to feel concerned,' 'could be really helpful') rather than casual first-person language like 'I'd say' or 'I think'",
      "Missing casual interjections that would make it feel more like texting a friend (e.g., 'Ugh,' 'That sucks,' 'Honestly')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "End with a specific question like 'What changes have you noticed in them?' or 'Do you want to brainstorm what to say?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Replace tentative phrases like 'It's normal to feel concerned' with more casual validation like 'Ugh, that's such a worrying feeling' and add first-person opinions like 'I'd say the best approach is...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😕 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the supportive tone without being excessive"
