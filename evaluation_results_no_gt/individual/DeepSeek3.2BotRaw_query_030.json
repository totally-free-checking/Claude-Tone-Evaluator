      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use in the moment (e.g., 'I don't feel great about sharing homework — let's study together instead')",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that invites continued conversation ('Want help practicing what to say?')",
      "Opens with immediate validation acknowledging the awkwardness of the situation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers (###) makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a text conversation - the entire middle section is structured lists",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses 'You could' and 'Here are options' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think'",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end is natural, specific to the situation, and invites further dialogue perfectly",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs - instead of listing options, weave them into a conversational flow like 'If you want to keep it light, I'd probably say something like...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get that') to make it feel like a real person talking rather than an instruction manual",
      "Remove all headers and bold formatting - a teen friend wouldn't text you with subheadings and bullet lists",
      "Expand the emotional validation to balance the heavy advice section - acknowledge how hard it is to set boundaries with friends before listing what to say"
