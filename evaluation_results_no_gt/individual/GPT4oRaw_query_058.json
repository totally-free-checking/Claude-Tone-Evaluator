    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of natural prose with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text message",
      "Strong first-person validation opening with 'Aw, I totally understand feeling that way' that immediately acknowledges the teen's nerves",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually say: 'I'm a little nervous about this' or 'I'm not sure how to say this'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could enhance warmth slightly with phrases like 'That's so relatable' or 'We've all been there' to deepen the validation",
      "While the absence of emojis is appropriate for this serious topic, a single warm emoji early on could enhance the 'supportive friend' vibe"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The response perfectly balances emotional validation with concrete, realistic advice, offering both empathy ('They'll get it') and practical preparation strategies (jotting notes) without overwhelming the teen",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The validation, while present, could be slightly more immediate and emotionally resonant before transitioning to the 'remember counselors are there to help' reassurance",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as three natural paragraphs with no headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one gentle emoji (like 😊 or 💙) early in the response to enhance warmth, though the current tone is appropriately professional for the topic",
      "Could strengthen the opening validation by explicitly stating 'We've all been there' or similar before moving to reassurance about counselors",
      "The first-person language is good but could be enhanced with explicit 'I think' or 'I'd say' phrases to make it feel even more like personal advice from a friend"
