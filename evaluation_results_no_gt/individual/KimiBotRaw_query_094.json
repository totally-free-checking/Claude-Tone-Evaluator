    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific actionable techniques like the 4-7-8 breathing method, 20-20-20 screen rule, and progressive muscle relaxation",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question ('How long have these been going on?') that invites continued conversation",
      "Includes appropriate safety guidance about when to seek medical attention",
      "Opens with strong validation ('Ugh, stress headaches are the worst—that tight, squeezing feeling that just won't quit')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely heavy use of bullet points and headers ('Quick relief:', 'Short-term fixes:', etc.) makes it read like a WebMD article rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout—no 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I'm here' to create personal connection; uses impersonal framing like 'Here are some things that might help'",
      "Missing the 'I' in 'Totally get why you're frustrated' which makes it feel less personal",
      "Advice is presented as a checklist rather than integrated into flowing prose"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific techniques (temple massage, 4-7-8 breathing, caffeine checks) are realistic, immediately actionable, and appropriate for a teen's agency and resources",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - the response uses 4 section headers and approximately 9 bullet points, creating a structured, instructional feel that completely diverges from the ideal conversational paragraph format",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 9,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response uses heavy formatting with bold headers and bullet lists for 'Quick relief,' 'Short-term fixes,' 'The stress piece,' and 'When to check in with a doc.' Only the opening and closing sentences are in natural prose paragraphs. Reads like a health guide rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 flowing paragraphs without headers or bullets—integrate the advice naturally into sentences like 'I'd suggest trying the 4-7-8 breathing technique where you breathe in for 4 seconds...' instead of listing it",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: 'I think the quickest relief might be...' or 'When I'm stressed, I find that...' or 'I'm here if you need to talk through what's stressing you out'",
      "Move from the opening validation directly into prose-style suggestions rather than 'Here are some things' followed by a list format"
