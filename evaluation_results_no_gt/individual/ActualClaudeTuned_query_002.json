      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sinking feeling' and 'We've all been there' that normalizes the experience",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",

      "Could incorporate more first-person singular statements beyond 'I think' (such as 'I'd say' or 'I get how stressful that is') to strengthen the personal connection",
