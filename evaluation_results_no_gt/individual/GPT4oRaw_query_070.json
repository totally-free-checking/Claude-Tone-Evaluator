    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can use ('Hey, I noticed you seemed upset...') which makes the advice immediately actionable",
      "Appropriate length that feels substantial but not overwhelming for a mobile conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and instructional rather than like a supportive friend talking",
      "Validation is weak and distant ('It can be upsetting when feelings get involved like that') rather than warm and immediate ('Ugh, that's so rough', 'We've all been there')",
      "Uses formal/instructional phrasing like 'It might be worth having' and 'Be empathetic' instead of casual first-person sharing"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, maintaining conversational flow throughout",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - instead of 'It might be worth having a conversation,' try 'I think you should try having a conversation' or 'I'd probably sit down with them and say...'",
      "Start with stronger, warmer validation before jumping to solutions - something like 'Ugh, that's such a tough spot to be in' or 'I totally get why that feels stressful' before offering advice",
      "Make the follow-up question more specific and engaging - instead of 'How do you feel about their reaction?' try 'Do you think they felt left out, or has this been building up for a while?' to show you're really listening to their specific situation"
