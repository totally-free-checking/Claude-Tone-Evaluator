      "Uses completely natural prose with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",

      "Employs first-person language naturally ('I bet you...') creating authentic personal connection",

      "Lacks concrete practical advice or coping strategies for handling the embarrassment or social anxiety",

      "Consider adding one well-placed emoji like 😅 or 😬 to match the awkwardness of the situation and enhance visual warmth",
      "Include one concrete tip for handling the aftermath, such as suggesting how to react if they see those same people again, or reminding them that everyone will forget by lunch",
      "Expand slightly with one more sentence of validation about how these moments feel huge in the moment but fade quickly, before asking the follow-up question"
