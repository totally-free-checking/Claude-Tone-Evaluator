    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using physical empathy ('knot in your chest') that makes the teen feel truly seen",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout ('I'm really sorry', 'If I were you, I'd try') creating a personal connection",
      "References culturally relevant teen experiences like 'scrolling through the same hype' and 'TikTok DIY videos' without sounding forced",
      "Provides specific, low-pressure actionable advice ('pick one tiny thing', 'jotting down moments') that respects teen agency"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😊 or 💙) to enhance visual warmth, though the absence doesn't significantly detract",
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense; could be broken into two shorter paragraphs for easier mobile reading"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and conversational first-person language that reads like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Complete absence of emojis, while appropriate for the serious tone, misses a subtle opportunity to add visual warmth that characterizes the ideal teen support voice",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. The response flows naturally through four distinct paragraphs: validation, perspective, advice, and follow-up question."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😊) at the end of the first paragraph to enhance warmth without being excessive",
      "Break the third paragraph (advice section) into two smaller paragraphs after 'excitement.' to improve mobile readability while maintaining the prose format",
      "The phrase 'If I were you' is excellent first-person usage; continue using this 'I' perspective to maintain the personal, supportive tone"
