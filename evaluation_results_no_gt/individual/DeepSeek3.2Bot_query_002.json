    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person empathetic language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I think', 'I'd say') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to the teacher ('I'm really sorry, I totally forgot this was due...') making advice immediately usable",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural conversational flow"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question assumes the user already spoke to the teacher ('How did your teacher react when you told them?'), which may not match the timeline of the situation",
      "Could include slightly more emotional validation before transitioning to the practical advice section, though the opening is strong"

      "Consider adjusting the follow-up question to account for whether they've spoken to the teacher yet, such as 'Do you think you'll be able to talk to them today?' or 'What's your plan for telling them?'",
      "The transition from validation to advice is good, but could add one more validating sentence like 'It's so stressful when that happens' before 'I'd say the best move' to maximize emotional support"
