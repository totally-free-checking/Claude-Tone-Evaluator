    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with physical imagery ('sits in your chest') that makes the fear feel understood and normalized",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact scripting for talking to the teacher ('I'm really worried I'm not going to pass—can you tell me what I should focus on first') which removes the barrier of not knowing what to say",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points—advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs using phrases like 'check two things first' embedded in text"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest'—uses imperative advice ('check two things,' 'it's worth emailing') rather than personal perspective statements",
      "The word 'levers' in paragraph 2 feels slightly corporate/formal compared to the rest of the casual tone, though used in quotes to soften it"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with advice fully integrated into conversational paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of explicit first-person perspective statements ('I think,' 'I'd say') makes the advice feel slightly more instructional than personal connection",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent use of continuous prose throughout all four paragraphs. Advice is embedded naturally within sentences rather than listed out. No bold text, headers, or numbered lists used."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one or two explicit first-person phrases like 'I think the best move is...' or 'I'd suggest starting with...' to strengthen the personal connection and differentiate from generic advice articles",
      "Consider replacing 'levers' with more casual language like 'moves you can make' or 'things you can try' to maintain the conversational teen-appropriate voice throughout"
