      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such an awkward spot to be in!' and acknowledging the specific 'pit-in-your-stomach feeling'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, particularly 'If I were you, I'd try...' which creates a personal, friend-to-friend dynamic",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script ('I'm really flattered, but I just see you as a friend') that a teen can actually use",

      "Consider condensing the final two questions into one focused question like 'How are you feeling about having that conversation with them?' to avoid overwhelming the user with multiple prompts",
