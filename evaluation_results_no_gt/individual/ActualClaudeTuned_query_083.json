      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think everyone has been there', 'If I were you, I'd maybe try', 'I think it's totally normal') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation with an older sibling",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, that's like one of the most confusing situations ever' followed by normalization of the experience",
      "Specific actionable advice including concrete observation strategies (comparing behavior with others vs. user) and low-risk experimentation (eye contact, playful teasing)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could deepen emotional validation slightly by acknowledging the anxiety or self-doubt that often accompanies this confusion",
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother - currently shifts somewhat abruptly from 'impossible to tell' to observational tactics"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person perspective that makes it feel like texting with a supportive friend rather than receiving a self-help article",

      "Consider adding one more sentence acknowledging the specific anxiety of potential rejection or embarrassment to deepen emotional validation before moving to solutions",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be split into two separate questions to feel even more conversational rather than the 'or' construction"
