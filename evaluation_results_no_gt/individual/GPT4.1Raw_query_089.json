    "strengths": [
      "Excellent conversational tone using first-person language naturally ('I totally get that feeling', 'I can help you figure out')",
      "Strong opening validation that normalizes the experience ('don't beat yourself up', 'Procrastination happens to everyone')",
      "Natural, engaging follow-up question that invites specifics ('tell me what's on your plate right now')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured bullet points with bold headers instead of flowing prose paragraphs",
      "Transitions to advice with 'Here are a couple of simple tips' which feels like a self-help article format",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the four bullet points into 1-2 flowing paragraphs where the advice naturally weaves together instead of being listed out",
      "Add one more sentence of emotional validation about how overwhelming it feels when things pile up before transitioning to the advice",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💪) early in the response to match the casual 'Ugh' opening"
