      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sounds so annoying!' and 'We've all had that friend' creates instant rapport and normalizes the experience",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use like 'Hey, I've noticed you're doing that thing I just started – it's kinda funny, but I like having my own style too!'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one more explicit first-person support statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "The follow-up question, while good, could be slightly more open-ended to invite deeper sharing beyond just categorizing the copying"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting in conversational paragraphs",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief closing validation like 'I'm here if you need to vent more' to reinforce the supportive relationship",
      "The perspective that the friend admires them is well-handled, but could briefly acknowledge that the annoyance is still totally valid to avoid any hint of minimizing their feelings"
