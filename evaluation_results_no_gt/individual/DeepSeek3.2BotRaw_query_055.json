    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation with 'Ah, that feeling hits hard sometimes' immediately acknowledges the emotional weight and normalizes the experience",
      "Appropriate single emoji usage (🌱) at the end reinforces the growth message without being excessive or cringe",
      "Practical advice is specific and teen-appropriate, mentioning concrete actions like deleting/archiving and suggesting actual script 'Hey, I wanted to clarify...'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points (3 items) breaks the conversational prose format; advice is delivered as a list rather than flowing naturally within paragraphs",
      "Lacks first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it,' making the advice feel impersonal and detached rather than like a friend texting",
      "Fails to end with a follow-up question; while 'Want to talk about what happened?' appears early, the response concludes with a statement, missing the opportunity to re-engage the user"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - single appropriate emoji enhancing warmth without excess",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - heavy bullet point usage contrary to natural paragraph flow",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "45%",
      "notes": "Response uses three distinct bullet points to deliver the core advice, breaking the conversational flow. The middle section is entirely structured as a list rather than integrated into natural prose paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Remove the bullet points and rewrite the advice as flowing sentences within a paragraph, e.g., 'If it's on social media, I'd suggest just deleting or editing it if you can. For messages, you could always send a quick follow-up...'",
      "Integrate first-person language throughout, such as 'I think the best approach depends on...' or 'I'd say give yourself some time...' to create a more personal, supportive connection",
      "Move the question to the very end of the response to encourage continued conversation, or add a new specific question like 'What kind of post was it - something personal or just something you think might be cringey?'"
