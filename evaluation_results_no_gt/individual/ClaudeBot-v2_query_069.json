      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think about it', 'I'd treat it', 'I'm really sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Zero bullet points or formatting - flows as natural conversational prose with smooth transitions between validation, explanation, and advice",
      "Immediately validates the emotional experience with 'Ugh' and acknowledges the second-guessing nature of the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while capturing the awkwardness of the situation, might slightly understate the seriousness of potential bullying for some users (though it works for the 'uncertainty' aspect)",
      "Could include one more explicit 'you're not alone' type validation in the middle section to break up the advice-heavy third paragraph"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero structural elements - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in paragraphs",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences and paragraphs."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😕 or 💙 instead of 😅 for situations involving potential bullying to match the emotional weight while keeping warmth",
      "The compound question at the end works well, but could be split into two sentences for even more conversational flow, though it's not necessary"
