    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I totally get why you're feeling annoyed' that mirrors the teen's frustration perfectly",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say,' 'I totally get') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('Okay, I hear you,' 'I'll think about it') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The perspective shift to 'he's probably coming from a place of caring' could potentially feel slightly minimizing to some teens, though it's framed gently",
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance the warm, casual tone (like 😅 or 😤) to match the 'Ugh' energy at the start"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, flowing like a text conversation with an older sibling",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight risk of the 'parents are like that' perspective feeling dismissive, even though it's intended to help reframe the situation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice is woven into conversational sentences rather than structured as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the beginning (like 😅) to visually match the 'Ugh' sentiment and enhance the casual tone",
      "Could soften the perspective shift about the dad's intentions with a phrase like 'I know this might be annoying to hear, but...' to ensure it doesn't feel dismissive of their frustration",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific - keep using this approach of asking context-specific questions rather than generic 'How are you feeling?' questions"
