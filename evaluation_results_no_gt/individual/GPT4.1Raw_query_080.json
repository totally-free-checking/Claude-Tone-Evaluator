      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",

      "Completely lacks concrete practical advice or coping strategies for managing the immediate terror/anxiety while waiting for the conversation",

      "Consider offering a gentle reframe or perspective shift that's actionable ('If you can, try to remember that our brains always assume the worst...')"
