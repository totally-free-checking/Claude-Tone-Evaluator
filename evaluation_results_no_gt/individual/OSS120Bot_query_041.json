    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate first-person validation ('Ugh, I feel you') and empathetic language ('such a gut punch') that mirrors the user's casual tone",
      "Uses natural prose throughout with zero bullet points or formatting, reading like a supportive text from a friend ('Honestly, most of us have been there')",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice tailored to teen constraints (borrowing from friends, cafeteria, teacher's stash, nearby store with 'little cash')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice could be slightly smoother; 'If you can' feels slightly abrupt after the emotional acknowledgment",
      "The phrase 'it usually isn't as big of a deal' risks minimizing the feeling, though the qualifier 'as it feels in the moment' helps preserve validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format - maintains perfect conversational flow across four paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, creating an authentic texting-like experience",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight abruptness in pivot from emotional validation to practical solutions - could use one more transitional sentence to bridge 'we've all been there' with the problem-solving advice",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout. Advice is embedded naturally within sentences ('see if a friend has a spare snack you can borrow or hit the cafeteria') rather than listed. No headers, bold text, or numbered lists used."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief transitional phrase between validation and advice like 'Here's what I'd do' or 'A few ideas:' to smooth the pivot from feelings to solutions",
      "The follow-up question is strong, but could be made slightly more specific to their current situation by asking 'Do you have any friends nearby who might have extras?' before shifting to the general 'go-to snack' question"
