    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using relatable examples ('like when you find a cool hidden gem of a restaurant') that immediately make the teen feel understood",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I've noticed we've been twinning a lot lately...') and realistic deflection phrases ('Oh, just some random shop')",
      "Ends with an engaging, specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the nuances of their situation ('Has it been happening with specific things... or is it literally everything?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers ('**The subtle route**', '**The direct conversation**', '**The boundary route**') makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a text conversation with a friend",
      "Lacks first-person narrative voice - doesn't use 'I'd say', 'I think', or 'I get it' to share personal perspective; instead uses imperative commands ('Start keeping...', 'Mix up...', 'Pick a calm moment')",
      "Structures advice as categorized lists rather than natural flowing prose, creating distance between the supporter and teen"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic strategies with specific wording teens can actually use in the moment",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - uses extensive bullet points, headers, and structured lists instead of conversational paragraphs",

      "notes": "Response uses three distinct header sections with multiple bullet points under each, creating a very structured, article-like format rather than natural conversation flow"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the three sections (subtle route, direct conversation, boundary route) into flowing prose paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd probably start with something subtle...' or 'If that doesn't work, I'd suggest having a direct conversation where you say something like...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout using phrases like 'I get why that feels invasive' or 'I think the best approach depends on your friendship dynamic' to create a more personal, supportive connection rather than an instructional tone",
      "Remove all headers and bold formatting; instead use transition phrases like 'Another option is...' or 'You could also try...' to maintain the conversational, text-message feel"
