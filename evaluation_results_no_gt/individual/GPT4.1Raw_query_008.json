      "Provides concrete, actionable advice with a specific script example the teen can actually use ('Hey, I got invited to a party by [friend's name]...')",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured formatting with numbered bullet points and bold headers ('1. **Pick the right time:**', '2. **Share the details:**') which reads like a wikiHow article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal directives instead ('Try asking', 'Let them know', 'Talk about')",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping straight to solutions - only one brief sentence acknowledging it's nerve-wracking before 'Here are a few tips'",
      "Ending is an offer rather than an engaging question ('If you want, I can help...' instead of asking something specific about their situation)"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality and specific example script provided are realistic and immediately actionable for a teen",

      "notes": "Response uses a numbered list with bold headers (1-4) plus a separate formatted example block. This is extremely over-structured and reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation. The advice should flow naturally in paragraphs instead."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural prose paragraphs instead of using numbered tips - flow the advice naturally using transitions like 'I'd probably start by finding a moment when they're relaxed...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: change 'Try asking when they seem relaxed' to 'I'd suggest waiting for a moment when they seem relaxed...' and 'Let them know who invited you' to 'I'd make sure to tell them who invited you...'",
      "Deepen the emotional validation at the start before giving advice: expand on 'That's totally understandable' with something like 'That pre-party parent conversation is always nerve-wracking - I remember that feeling!'",
      "Change the ending to a specific question about their situation rather than a service offer: 'What part of asking them feels most stressful to you - is it the timing or worried they might say no?'"
