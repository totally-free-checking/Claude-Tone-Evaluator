      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable feeling' and 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with that' which makes the teen feel heard right away",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs like 'If it helps, you could start with...'",
      "Highly specific and realistic advice including concrete examples like 'granola bar, fruit,' specific seating locations ('end of a table, near a wall'), and actionable coping strategies ('sip water, look at your phone')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice section - uses 'you could' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could,' which makes the advice feel slightly less personal",
      "Could benefit from one more 'I' statement like 'I get how that feels' or 'I've seen friends deal with this' to strengthen the personal connection in the middle section"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing first-person 'I think/I'd say' language in the practical advice section, making it slightly less personal than ideal",

      "Add first-person framing to advice using phrases like 'I'd suggest starting with...' or 'I think sitting with one trusted friend helps' to make it feel more like personal guidance from a friend",
      "Consider adding 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing support before the final question to reinforce availability"
