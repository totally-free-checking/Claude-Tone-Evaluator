    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so uncomfortable and kinda violating' - acknowledges both the emotional impact and the boundary violation",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say,' 'I totally get,' 'I noticed') creating genuine conversational connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use: 'Hey, I noticed you've been acting different since you checked my phone. What's going on?'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while conveying awkwardness, might slightly minimize the seriousness of the privacy violation aspect",

      "Consider using 💙 or 😔 instead of 😅 to better match the serious nature of privacy violations while maintaining warmth",
      "The validation is strong but could briefly acknowledge that feeling violated is completely valid before explaining parents' motivations"
