    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' and acknowledging that detention 'feels crappy'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact phrasing to use with the teacher ('I'm not trying to argue, I just want to understand...') and realistic escalation steps (dean/counselor, parent)",
      "Natural, engaging follow-up question that invites the teen to share their specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - relies heavily on second-person 'you can' instead of sharing personal perspective",
      "Emoji choice (😅) is slightly mismatched to the emotion - it conveys nervousness/awkwardness rather than the frustration or injustice of the situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective - sounds like good advice but missing the 'I'm here with you' connection of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest'",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create stronger connection - instead of 'you can usually at least get your side heard,' try 'I think you should try to get your side heard' or 'I'd suggest talking to the teacher...'",
      "Consider using 😤, 😕, or 💙 instead of 😅 for unfair situations, or omit the emoji entirely for serious topics",
      "Could add a closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk through what to say' to reinforce the supportive first-person presence"
