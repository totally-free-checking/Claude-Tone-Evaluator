      "Opens with strong emotional validation: 'I'm really sorry you're stuck in that frustrating spot—getting blamed for something you didn't do feels like a punch to the gut, right?' immediately acknowledges the pain",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—flows naturally like a text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script: 'I understand why this looks weird, but I actually wasn't the one who… could we go over what happened?'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective in the advice section—uses impersonal 'you can' and 'try to' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you should'",
      "The 😅 emoji, while warm, may feel slightly mismatched for the serious situation of being falsely accused (suggests nervous laughter rather than genuine empathy)"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective to advice: change 'you can gather any proof' to 'I'd probably start by gathering any proof' or 'I think your best move is...' to sound more like a supportive friend sharing personal insight",
      "Consider either removing the 😅 emoji for this serious topic or replacing with 😕 or 💙 to better match the gravity of being falsely accused, or simply rely on the warm prose without emoji"
