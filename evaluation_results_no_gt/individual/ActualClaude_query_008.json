    "strengths": [
      "Provides specific, actionable logistics to mention to parents (host details, location, transportation, supervision) that demonstrate responsibility",
      "Ends with a natural, context-specific follow-up question ('What kind of party is it?') that invites further conversation",
      "Includes realistic script suggestions like 'I wanted to check with you first...' and practical advice to ask what would make parents comfortable rather than getting defensive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers (**Be upfront and give details:**, **Timing matters:**, etc.) instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel instructional and impersonal rather than conversational",
      "Minimal emotional validation - only briefly mentions 'nerve-wracking' before immediately jumping into structured, list-based advice"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific logistical details and suggested phrases are realistic and immediately actionable for a teen",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting structure - uses four sections with bold headers and extensive bullet points, reading like a wikiHow article or instruction manual rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 9,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses four distinct header sections with bullet lists (**Be upfront and give details:**, **Timing matters:**, **Show you're being responsible:**). Only the opening sentence and final paragraph are in natural prose form; approximately 75% of the content is structured as bullets or headers."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert all bullet points into flowing prose paragraphs - instead of listing questions as bullets, write conversationally: 'I'd probably start by gathering the details they'll definitely ask about - like who's hosting it, where exactly it is, and how you're planning to get there and back.'",
      "Add first-person connection and deeper emotional validation at the start: replace 'That's exciting about the party invite!' with something like 'Ugh, that pre-asking anxiety is so real! I totally get why you're nervous about bringing it up - it's vulnerable to put yourself out there like that.'",
      "Remove all bold headers and instructional formatting - write it like you're texting a supportive friend rather than writing a how-to guide, using natural transitions like 'Honestly, timing matters a lot here...' instead of '**Timing matters:**'"
