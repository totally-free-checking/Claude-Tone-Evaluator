      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd probably', 'I totally get') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I've been trying to get better sleep lately so I'm putting my phone on silent after 11pm')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition from validation to advice ('The good news is this is super fixable!') is slightly abrupt and could use one more sentence of emotional acknowledgment",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no lists, headers, or over-structuring",

      "Add one sentence acknowledging the awkwardness of setting boundaries with friends before offering solutions, like 'It can feel weird to tell a friend to back off, but...'",
      "Consider softening the transition from validation to advice - instead of 'The good news is this is super fixable!', try something like 'That exhaustion is so real, and honestly you deserve uninterrupted sleep. The good news is...'"
