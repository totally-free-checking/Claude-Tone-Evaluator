    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('Hey, it's totally normal to feel that way') that normalizes the experience",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice for teens like choosing 'safe' foods and sitting in quieter corners rather than generic platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a 4-item bullet list instead of conversational prose ('A couple of things that might help:' followed by bullets)",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal despite casual word choice",
      "Ends with 'You've got this' instead of a follow-up question to continue the conversation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - the suggestions are concrete, age-appropriate, and immediately actionable (starting with one or two friends, choosing non-messy foods, sitting in corners)",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The heavy reliance on bullet points instead of natural prose paragraphs - this makes it read like a self-help checklist rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response uses 'A couple of things that might help:' as a header introducing 4 bullet points. This is exactly the over-structuring to avoid. The advice should flow naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 1-2 flowing paragraphs that weave the advice naturally into conversation (e.g., 'I'd probably start by eating with just one friend you trust, and maybe choose foods that feel easy to eat...')",
      "Add a genuine follow-up question at the end to invite further conversation (e.g., 'Is there a specific part of eating at school that makes you most nervous, or is it just the whole thing?')",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout to create connection (e.g., 'I totally get that feeling,' 'I'd feel the same way,' or 'I think the best thing to do is...')"
