    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'that unfairness just sits with you and makes you want to shout at the walls'",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try', 'I know it feels like', 'I promise') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including an exact script the teen could use when talking to the teacher"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😤 or 😅) at the start to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though the absence doesn't significantly hurt the response",
      "The reassurance 'this won't define the way teachers or your friends see you' could potentially feel slightly dismissive of the immediate emotional impact, though it is well-intentioned"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - it consistently uses natural casual speech ('Honestly', 'like', 'knock out some homework') and first-person perspective ('I'd try', 'I were you') that makes it feel like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while zero emojis is acceptable, adding one appropriate emoji could have enhanced the warmth slightly, though this is a minor nitpick",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😤 or 🙄) at the beginning to match the 'Ugh' sentiment and enhance visual warmth",
      "The advice about talking to the teacher could briefly acknowledge that this might feel intimidating ('I know confronting a teacher can feel nerve-wracking, but...') to validate potential anxiety about that step"
