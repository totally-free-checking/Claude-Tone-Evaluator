    "strengths": [
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout, such as 'If it were me, I'd probably try talking to them about it...' which creates an authentic, supportive connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable dialogue script ('Hey, I know you're joking, but some of those comments have been bothering me. Can we tone it down a bit?') that gives the teen exact words to use in a difficult conversation",
      "Maintains perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a natural text conversation with a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question 'Do you think they'd take it well if you brought it up?' is slightly closed-ended (inviting yes/no) rather than open-ended to encourage deeper reflection",
      "Could include one additional validating phrase specifically acknowledging how confusing it feels when a friend—who should be supportive—is the source of hurt, before moving to the 'this happens a lot' normalization"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider revising the follow-up question to be more open-ended, such as 'What worries you most about bringing it up with them?' to invite deeper sharing rather than a yes/no assessment",
      "Could add one sentence specifically validating the confusion of being hurt by someone trusted before noting that 'this happens a lot' to ensure the teen feels fully seen in their specific situation"
