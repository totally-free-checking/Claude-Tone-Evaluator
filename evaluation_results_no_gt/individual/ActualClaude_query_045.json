      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oh no, that's so frustrating!' and acknowledging it's 'one of the worst feelings'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice is minimal since it focuses on gathering information before offering solutions (contextually appropriate but could include one small immediate coping strategy)",
