    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I bet', 'I remember doing something similar') that creates genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and capturing the specific 'want the floor to swallow you whole' feeling",
      "Natural follow-up question that mirrors the user's own language ('dying inside') showing active listening"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice section is slightly brief - could offer one additional specific tactic for handling immediate embarrassment or peer reactions",
      "Could validate the 'want to disappear' feeling a bit more explicitly before moving to reassurance"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language usage - consistently uses 'I' statements and casual phrasing ('zoning out', 'eating at you') that makes it feel like a real person, not an AI",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice depth - while the advice given is good and realistic, it could offer one or two more specific 'in the moment' coping strategies for when the embarrassment feels overwhelming",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more specific tactic for handling the immediate aftermath, such as a breathing technique or specific self-talk phrase for when the cringe feeling hits later",
      "The validation is strong but could explicitly name the 'want to disappear' feeling the user mentioned to show you heard that specific phrase before moving to solutions"
