    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation with phrases like 'Getting cut hits right in the chest' and acknowledging that 'trying to act fine on top of that is exhausting'",
      "Specific, actionable advice including an exact script for talking to the coach ('Hey, I really want to improve—what are 1–2 things I should work on...') that feels realistic for a teen",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel slightly less like a personal conversation and more like general wisdom; no 'I' statements appear in the response",
      "The 😅 emoji, while acknowledging the awkwardness of trying to 'act fine,' could be slightly confusing as it often signals nervous laughter rather than empathy for disappointment"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow without any bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of first-person connection language; it uses 'Honestly' and 'it makes total sense' but never explicitly says 'I understand' or 'I think' to create that personal bond",

      "Add first-person language to create stronger connection, such as 'I think you're being way too hard on yourself' or 'I'd be crushed too if that happened to me' or 'I'm here if you need to vent more'",
      "Consider using 😊 or 💙 instead of 😅 for this specific situation, or simply removing the emoji since the text already conveys the awkwardness of trying to act fine"
