    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I hear you', 'If I were you', 'I'd start by') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs like a text from a friend",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen lunch situations (suggesting wraps/smoothies for easy eating, picking a corner spot, grounding techniques)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to the reality check ('most people are way more focused on their own plates') happens quickly and could use one more sentence of emotional acknowledgment first",
      "The grounding move suggestion, while helpful, is slightly more structured/clinical than the rest of the casual tone"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation style with consistent first-person perspective ('If I were you, I'd start by...') that makes it feel like a supportive friend rather than an advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight shift to a more logical/reality-based perspective ('the pressure is usually bigger in our heads') comes quickly after validation without a softer bridge",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely in natural paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or lists. Advice is woven seamlessly into conversational sentences rather than being presented as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one more sentence of emotional validation between the opening empathy and the 'most people are focused on their own plates' reality check to soften that transition",
      "Consider replacing 'grounding move' with more casual language like 'little trick' or 'thing to try' to maintain the conversational vibe throughout"
