    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific, relatable language: 'Ugh, that really sucks—feeling like you're the only one stuck inside while everyone else is out having fun is so frustrating and isolating'",
      "Excellent use of first-person conversational language throughout: 'I'd say,' 'I totally get,' and 'I get that you're worried' in the suggested script",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrases the teen can use when talking to parents, making it immediately applicable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transitions slightly quickly to explaining parents' perspective ('most of them just worry because they care') which could potentially feel like minimizing the frustration, though it does acknowledge 'even if it doesn't feel that way right now'",
      "The tag question 'isn't it?' at the end of the first sentence, while conversational, slightly breaks the flow of pure validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - the response flows as conversational paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The balance between validation and advice leans slightly toward the explanatory/advice side in the middle paragraph, though it maintains warmth throughout",

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose with four distinct paragraphs. No bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers used. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure validation after acknowledging the parents' perspective to ensure the teen feels fully heard before moving to solutions",
      "The response is exemplary overall; maintain this exact balance of casual first-person language ('I'd say,' 'I totally get') and specific scripting for difficult conversations"
