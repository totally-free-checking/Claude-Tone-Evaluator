      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'I'm so sorry' and 'It totally sucks' that acknowledge the unfairness and frustration",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with specific advice embedded in sentences",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'd suggest', 'I'm so sorry') creating personal connection",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen could use: 'I understand why it looked that way, but here's what really happened'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'stuff like this happens to a lot of people' while validating could slightly minimize the individual's specific experience, though the follow-up 'it feels way bigger in the moment' helps",
      "Could include one more 'I' statement in the advice section to strengthen the personal connection, though 'I'd suggest' is already present"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - maintains conversational flow throughout while embedding practical advice naturally within paragraphs",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider varying the validation slightly to avoid any potential minimization - instead of 'stuff like this happens to a lot of people,' perhaps 'I know it feels isolating, but this kind of mix-up happens more than you'd think'",
      "Add one more first-person reflection in the advice section, such as 'If it were me, I'd try to talk to them as soon as possible' to strengthen the personal connection"
