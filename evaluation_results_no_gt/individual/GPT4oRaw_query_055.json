    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Oh no, I hear you' and 'it happens to the best of us' that normalizes the mistake",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrases the teen could use for a follow-up post ('Hey, I changed my mind on that last post')",
      "Ends with a nuanced follow-up question that distinguishes between embarrassment and worry, showing genuine interest in their specific emotional state"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it'—relies heavily on 'you' statements which feels slightly less personal",
      "Could deepen emotional validation before moving to solutions; jumps quickly from 'don't stress' to actionable advice without fully sitting with the regret feeling first"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, lists, or over-structuring—maintains perfect conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Limited use of first-person language (missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk') making the advice feel slightly more instructional than personal",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as three natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, bold text, or numbered items. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective phrases like 'I think deleting it is probably your best bet' or 'I'd feel the same way in your shoes' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after 'Oh no' to enhance the relatable, casual tone, though the absence is not problematic",
      "Include a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing to reinforce the supportive relationship before asking the follow-up question"
