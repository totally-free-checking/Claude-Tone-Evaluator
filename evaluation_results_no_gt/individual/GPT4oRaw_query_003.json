      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Strong use of first-person language ('I totally get') and casual contractions that create authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice options (casual small talk vs. keeping to yourself) that respect the teen's agency"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Contains two questions which slightly disrupts the flow (one in the first paragraph and one at the end); ideally would have one strong closing question",
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance warmth for this awkward social situation (a 😅 or 😬 would fit naturally)",

      "Consider adding one well-placed emoji (like 😅) early in the response to enhance warmth and acknowledge the awkwardness visually",
      "Move the first question ('Are they giving off awkward vibes...') to later in the response or integrate it into the final question to avoid multiple question marks",
      "Add slightly more emotional validation before the first question - perhaps one more sentence acknowledging how uncomfortable that 'history' feeling is"
