    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout with natural use of 'I'd,' 'If I were you,' and 'I'm so sorry' creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation that names specific feelings ('infuriating,' 'chest feel tight') and normalizes the experience",
      "Specific actionable script provided ('I get why this looks bad, but I didn't do it...') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Third paragraph is quite long and dense; breaking into two shorter paragraphs would improve phone readability",
      "While appropriate for the serious topic, a single well-placed emoji (like 😓 or 😤) could enhance warmth without undermining gravity"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - advice flows conversationally within paragraphs using first-person guidance",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Length of the third paragraph which packs multiple steps (gathering proof, what to say, written statement, involving parents) into one dense block",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural paragraphs with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice is embedded in conversational prose using 'If I were you, I'd...' structure rather than imperative commands."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Break the long advice paragraph into two smaller ones after the suggested script to improve mobile readability",
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😓) after the opening validation to enhance warmth, though the current text-only approach is acceptable for this serious topic"
