    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person advice framing ('If I were you, I'd probably...') that creates a supportive, personal connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation using relatable metaphors ('carrying around this ticking time bomb') and normalization ('It's totally normal to feel a bit uneasy')",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points, headers, or over-formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly verbose in the middle section where it reassures about caring for the friend - could be tightened by one sentence",
      "The 'ticking time bomb' metaphor, while evocative, might slightly heighten anxiety rather than soothe it for some users"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational first-person advice delivery - flows perfectly as a text conversation without any structural crutches",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Length is marginally longer than ideal (4 paragraphs vs optimal 2-3), though still within acceptable range",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect paragraph structure with natural transitions between validation (paragraphs 1-2), practical advice (paragraph 3), and re-engagement (paragraph 4). No formatting distractions."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the 'If I were you, I'd...' framing as it creates strong personal connection and distinguishes this from generic advice",
      "Consider tightening the second paragraph by combining the validation of 'caring about your friend' with the first sentence to improve pacing slightly"
