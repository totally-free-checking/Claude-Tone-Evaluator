    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and naming the specific feeling of not feeling welcome",
      "Natural first-person language throughout (e.g., 'I'd keep it super simple,' 'I feel kinda awkward') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable script provided for talking to the friend: 'I feel kinda awkward around your parents—did I do something, or is there a way you want me to act around them?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one strategically placed emoji (e.g., 😅 or 😬) early in the response to visually reinforce the awkwardness and warmth, though the absence doesn't significantly detract"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose flow and conversational formatting - completely avoids bullet points and structured advice, instead weaving suggestions naturally into paragraphs that read like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while zero emojis is acceptable, one well-placed emoji could have enhanced the warmth given the specific 'awkward' nature of the situation",

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one emoji (like 😅) after the opening validation to match the 'awkward' tone of the query and add visual warmth",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of contextual engagement in future responses"
