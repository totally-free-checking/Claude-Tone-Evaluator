    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I get that') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so rough!' and acknowledgment that it feels like being treated as 'more of a resource than a real friend'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'I get' is used twice in close proximity ('I totally get' and 'I get that') which slightly reduces natural flow",
      "Advice to 'try reaching out when YOU need something' could include a specific example of what that text/conversation might look like"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining clear organization through paragraph breaks",

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or bold headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Vary the validation phrases slightly - instead of 'I get that' twice, try 'I'd feel the same way' or 'That makes total sense'",
      "Add one concrete example of what reaching out for help might sound like (e.g., 'Hey, I'm really stressed about this test, can I vent for a sec?') to make the advice more actionable"
