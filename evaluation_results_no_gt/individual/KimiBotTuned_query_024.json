    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that really sucks' and 'hits you right in the stomach' that perfectly captures the physical feeling of rejection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I saw you all hung out—no worries, but I felt kinda left out. Next time can you invite me?'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—it reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd feel the same way,' or 'I get it'—uses observational language ('this happens to a lot of people') rather than personal connection",
      "Could include one more 'I' statement to establish the bot as a specific supportive presence rather than general advice-giver"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow—completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining readability",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person 'I' statements (such as 'I think' or 'I'd say') makes the response slightly less personal despite being conversational",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one first-person phrase like 'I'd feel the same way' or 'I think the best approach is...' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider adding 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar closing support before the follow-up question to reinforce availability"
