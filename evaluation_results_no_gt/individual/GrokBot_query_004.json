    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person validation with phrases like 'I get it—I've been there too' and 'I'd try sending a gentle nudge' that create genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Specific, actionable advice including the exact script 'Hey, you've seemed kinda off lately—everything okay?' which gives the teen concrete language to use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly more gradual, though the balance is still strong",
      "The emoji usage, while appropriate, could potentially be seen as slightly light for a situation where the teen might be genuinely worried, though the 😅 fits the 'spiraling' context well"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language ('I get it', 'I'd try', 'I've been there') that makes it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling rather than receiving automated advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The response moves relatively quickly from emotional validation to practical solutions, though it maintains warmth throughout; it could linger slightly longer on the emotional acknowledgment before offering the 'what to do'",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. The advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining conversational flow throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of pure emotional validation before the advice paragraph to really sit with the feeling of confusion and hurt",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific; maintain this level of situational specificity in future responses"
