    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and specific acknowledgment of feeling 'exposed and powerless'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try,' 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word scripts the teen can use ('Yeah, that's not true. I'm not getting into it') and ('I know you've been saying ___ about me')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice, while expressing awkwardness, might slightly minimize the seriousness of the emotional pain for some users; a warmer emoji like 💙 or 😊 might land better",
      "Could include slightly more validation after the first paragraph before moving to the 'rumors survive on reactions' explanation, though the transition is relatively smooth"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - the advice flows conversationally within paragraphs exactly like a supportive friend texting, avoiding any checklist or self-help article structure",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection - using 😅 (grinning with sweat) for a painful rumor situation, while attempting to convey the awkwardness of the scenario, risks coming across as slightly minimizing compared to more supportive choices",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph structure with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice is seamlessly integrated into conversational prose using phrases like 'You can say something simple...' and 'If you know who started it...'"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😊 or 💙 instead of 😅 for serious emotional situations to avoid any perception of minimizing the pain, though keeping it to 0-1 emojis is perfect",
      "The balance between validation and advice is strong, but you could add one more validating sentence after 'Honestly, rumors usually survive...' to ensure the teen feels fully heard before moving to solutions",
      "The specific phrase suggestions are excellent - continue providing exact scripts teens can use word-for-word as this reduces the cognitive load when they're stressed"
