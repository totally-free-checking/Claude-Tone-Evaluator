    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd definitely', 'I'd text') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with specific physical descriptions ('your heart probably dropped into your stomach') and relatability ('We've all been there')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, reading like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice, while acceptable, slightly mismatches the panic emotion described (better suited for embarrassment/nervous laughter than genuine distress)",
      "The follow-up question combines two questions ('What did you lose, and do you remember...') which could feel slightly interrogative though still natural"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') that creates genuine peer-like support rather than institutional advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection (😅) doesn't perfectly align with the panic/fear emotion described, though it works for the relatability angle",

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining conversational integrity throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😟 or 😰 instead of 😅 for panic situations, or omitting the emoji entirely, as 😅 implies nervous laughter which may not match the 'freaking out' intensity",
      "The first-person language usage is exemplary - continue using 'I think', 'I'd suggest', and 'I get it' patterns to maintain the supportive friend persona"
