    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('You're definitely not alone—lots of people experience this') that normalizes the experience",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging question ('What's been on your mind lately?') that specifically invites the teen to share more about their racing thoughts",
      "Provides concrete, teen-appropriate coping strategies (doodling, funny videos, note apps) that are realistically accessible"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold formatting ('**Try some deep breathing:**') creates a clinical, self-help article feel rather than conversational texting",
      "Lacks first-person perspective in advice section—uses imperative commands ('Try,' 'Give yourself,' 'Distract') instead of personal recommendations ('I'd suggest,' 'I usually find')",
      "Opening validation uses somewhat formal phrasing ('I'm really sorry you're feeling that way') rather than casual teen-appropriate empathy ('Ugh, that brain-spin feeling is the worst')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question perfectly matches the ideal character—it's natural, specific to the situation about racing thoughts, and invites continued conversation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting diverges most significantly from the ideal: it uses a structured bullet list with bold headers rather than flowing prose that integrates advice naturally into conversation",

      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses a 4-item bullet list with bold headers and colons, creating a structured, instructional format rather than conversational flow. The advice is presented as a checklist rather than woven into natural sentences."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice section as natural prose using first-person recommendations: instead of 'Try some deep breathing,' use 'I'd suggest trying some deep breathing—even just a minute helps me slow down my thoughts'",
      "Remove all bullet points and bold formatting; integrate the four coping strategies into 1-2 flowing paragraphs that feel like a friend sharing ideas",
      "Add one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the casual, supportive tone, and replace formal phrases like 'If you'd like' with more casual language like 'Honestly' or 'I get it']}}}  \boxed{  "
