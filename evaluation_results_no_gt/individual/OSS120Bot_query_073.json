    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using 'Ugh, I get it' and acknowledges the 'draining' feeling of competitive friends",
      "Uses natural prose throughout with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use, including exact phrasing ('I love that you're passionate, but...') and concrete examples like the 'snack-eating contest' joke"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses second-person 'you could try' rather than first-person 'I'd suggest' or 'I think,' making it slightly less personal",
      "Follow-up question is technically a compound question (two parts), though they flow naturally together"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

      "Replace 'you could try' with 'I'd suggest' or 'In your shoes, I'd...' in the advice section to maintain the first-person connection established in the opening",
