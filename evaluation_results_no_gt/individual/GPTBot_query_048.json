    "strengths": [
      "Excellent specific scripts and phrases the teen can actually use (e.g., 'When you compare me to [sibling], I feel discouraged and like my efforts don't count')",
      "Strong opening validation that immediately acknowledges the feeling ('Ugh, yeah—that really does suck')",
      "Good specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the details of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers instead of natural prose paragraphs - reads like a self-help article rather than a text from a friend",
      "Lacks first-person empathetic language throughout - uses imperative instructional tone ('Name what's happening', 'Ask for what you need') instead of personal connection ('I'd suggest', 'I think you could try')",
      "Emotional validation is brief (one sentence) compared to extensive structured advice, creating an imbalanced feel"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides concrete, realistic scripts tailored to the sibling comparison scenario",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - uses 4+ bullet points with bold headers rather than conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response starts with one prose paragraph then immediately shifts to 'A few things that can help:' followed by heavily formatted bullet points with bold headers and sub-examples. Reads as structured advice rather than natural conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose paragraphs using first-person suggestions like 'I'd probably try saying something like...' or 'Maybe you could mention that...' to feel more like a friend texting rather than a guide",
      "Add more first-person empathetic language throughout such as 'I totally get how exhausting that is' or 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with this' to build personal connection",
      "Expand the emotional validation section before jumping to solutions - spend more time acknowledging how invalidating comparisons feel before offering the 'how to fix it' advice"
