    "strengths": [
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can use word-for-word (\"Hey, I got invited to a party on [day]...\")",
      "Ends with an engaging follow-up question that invites the teen to share more about their specific family dynamics",
      "Appropriate single emoji usage (😊) that enhances warmth without being excessive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured formatting with bold headers (Option 1, Option 2, Option 3) and bullet points rather than natural conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language and emotional validation - no 'I totally get why that feels nerve-wracking' or 'I'd feel anxious too' to create personal connection",
      "Reads like a wikiHow article or instruction manual rather than a supportive friend texting; very impersonal delivery"

      "notes": "Response is organized as a listicle with bold headers for each option (**Option 1**, **Option 2**, **Option 3**) and a 'Quick tips:' section with dash-based bullets. Lacks natural paragraph flow, reading more like a self-help article than a text conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite as 2-3 natural paragraphs instead of numbered options, weaving the different approaches into sentences like 'If your parents prefer directness, you could try saying...' or 'For a more casual vibe, I'd suggest...'",
      "Add first-person validation and empathy at the beginning like 'Oh man, I remember stressing about this exact thing!' or 'I totally get why that feels awkward - asking parents can be nerve-wracking'",
      "Remove headers and bold formatting entirely; integrate the advice naturally into prose with transitions between ideas"
