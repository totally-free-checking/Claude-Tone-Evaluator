      "Opens with immediate, strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such a rough feeling') that acknowledges the hurt of feeling used by friends",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I'm a little swamped right now—what's up?' and 'I miss just hanging out like we used to') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person perspective language (no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it') which makes it feel slightly more like general advice than a personal conversation",
      "Could include one more brief validating phrase before diving into the specific scripts to maintain the emotional connection through the advice section"

      "Add first-person phrases like 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd probably feel the same way' to create a stronger sense of personal connection and solidarity",
