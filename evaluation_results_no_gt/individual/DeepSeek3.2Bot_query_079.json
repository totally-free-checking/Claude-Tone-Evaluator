    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get that', 'I'd try', 'I bet you're noticing') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs ('I'd try grabbing a seat somewhere a bit more tucked away at first, or maybe eating with just one or two close friends')",
      "Specific, realistic advice tailored to teen agency (choosing seating location, selecting less messy foods, starting with close friends) rather than generic platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The reassurance that 'people are usually focused on their own food' could potentially feel slightly minimizing to someone with social anxiety, though it's softened by the inclusive 'our heads' framing",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅) at the opening to immediately signal casual support, though the absence is not problematic for this topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation style with first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any formatting structure or bullet points",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight missed opportunity for emoji usage to enhance warmth at the opening, though this is minor given the topic's sensitivity",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with natural flow. Advice is embedded within sentences using 'or maybe' transitions rather than list formatting. No headers, bold text, or structural elements present."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) at the very beginning to immediately set a casual, friendly tone",
      "The follow-up question is excellent but could be split into two separate questions for even more natural conversation flow, though the either/or format works well"
