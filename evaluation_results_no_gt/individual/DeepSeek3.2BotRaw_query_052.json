    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message",
      "Strong follow-up question with specific examples (letting others down vs. giving up) that show genuine interest in understanding the specific situation",
      "Immediate validation opening with 'That's a really common and understandable feeling'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses 'we' instead of 'I' (e.g., 'when we know' instead of 'I know' or 'I'd say'), making it feel impersonal like an article rather than a friend",
      "No practical advice or concrete suggestions offered - only asks questions without providing any initial framework for handling the guilt",
      "Could be warmer and more emotionally resonant - validation feels clinical rather than deeply empathetic (e.g., 'Guilt can pop up' vs. 'Ugh, that guilt is the worst')"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with no bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language and personal perspective - uses impersonal 'we' statements and lacks 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' phrasing that would make it feel like a real person",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or structured formatting. Response flows as natural paragraphs ideal for texting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout (e.g., 'I totally get that,' 'I'd feel the same way,' 'I think stepping back is brave') to create personal connection instead of using impersonal 'we' statements",
      "Include at least one small piece of practical perspective or advice before asking questions - for example, 'Sometimes quitting is actually the smart choice, even when it feels crappy' - so the teen gets immediate value, not just an interrogation",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the supportive tone, or alternatively, use more emotionally vivid language like 'Ugh, that sinking feeling' to increase warmth"
