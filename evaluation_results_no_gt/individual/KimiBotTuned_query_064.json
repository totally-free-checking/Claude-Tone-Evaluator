    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, specific validation ('Ugh, I'm so sorry — that oh no, where is it panic hits so hard') that captures the exact feeling of losing something important",
      "Uses pure natural prose with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice tailored to the school environment (checking under desks, specific locations like cafeteria/gym/bus, asking teachers)",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging two-part question that invites the teen to share specifics and continues the conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses imperative commands ('try to rewind', 'check the spots') rather than first-person framing ('I'd suggest trying to rewind', 'I think you should check') which creates a slight shift away from the warm first-person opening",
      "Could benefit from one more brief validating phrase in the middle to break up the longer practical advice paragraph"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - maintains conversational flow throughout with no over-structuring or list formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Shift from first-person empathetic language ('I'm so sorry') to imperative advice-giving without maintaining the 'I think/I'd suggest' perspective throughout",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within paragraph form as continuous thoughts."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to the advice section to maintain warmth (e.g., change 'try to rewind your day' to 'I'd start by trying to rewind your day' or 'I think the best first step is...')",
      "Consider adding a brief mid-response validation like 'I know it's hard to think clearly when you're panicking' to break up the longer advice paragraph and maintain emotional connection throughout"
