      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'I totally get why you're annoyed'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd probably,' 'I totally get,' 'I think' implied in tone) creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) is slightly mismatched for the emotion - it conveys nervous laughter/embarrassment rather than the frustration of unfair treatment",
      "Advice leans heavily toward passive acceptance ('just get through it') which, while realistic, could benefit from acknowledging the desire to advocate for oneself more explicitly"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language ('I'd probably,' 'I totally get') that makes it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😤, 😠, or 😞 instead of 😅 to better match the frustration of unfair treatment, or omit the emoji entirely since the text conveys warmth well",
      "While the advice to avoid escalating is realistic, you could add one sentence validating that it's okay to feel upset about the unfairness even while choosing not to fight it, to ensure the teen doesn't feel like they should just suppress their feelings"
