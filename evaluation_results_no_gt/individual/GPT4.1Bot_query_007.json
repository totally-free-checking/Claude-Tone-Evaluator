      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'Ugh, that's seriously the worst' and 'That pit-in-your-stomach feeling'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you', 'I can help you') creating genuine connection",
      "Specific, actionable advice including a concrete script for emailing the teacher ('Hey, I wanted you to know...')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Normalization ('this happens to so many people') comes slightly quickly after validation, potentially minimizing the unique stress of the situation before fully sitting with it",
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😤) to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though the absence isn't problematic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with zero bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight rush to normalize the situation with 'this happens to so many people' which, while true, could momentarily feel dismissive before the strong validation lands",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the start (like 😅) to immediately signal friendly support, though the text alone is warm enough",
      "Allow the validation to land for one more sentence before normalizing with 'this happens to so many people' - maybe acknowledge the specific unfairness of the timing ('due tomorrow') first"
