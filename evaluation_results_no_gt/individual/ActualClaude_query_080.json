    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with flowing paragraphs",
      "Strong immediate validation that normalizes the anxiety ('ultimate anxiety trigger', 'stomach drop instantly') making the teen feel understood",
      "Appropriate emoji usage (😬) that enhances the empathetic tone without being excessive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Limited first-person language - only uses 'I know' once instead of naturally incorporating 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' throughout",
      "Practical advice is somewhat generic ('take a deep breath', 'try not to spiral') and could include more specific coping strategies for the waiting period",
      "Asks two separate questions (who said it, and when) which slightly dilutes the conversational focus compared to one engaging follow-up"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring, creating a genuine conversational flow that feels like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Lack of consistent first-person perspective language - relies on general statements rather than personal connection phrases like 'I think' or 'I'd say'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Incorporate more first-person language throughout (e.g., 'I totally get why that would freak you out', 'I'd be panicking too', 'I think the worst part is the waiting') to strengthen the personal connection",
      "Offer more concrete, specific coping strategies for the immediate anxiety (e.g., 'Write down the worst-case scenario and then write three reasons it's probably not that', or 'Text a friend to sit with you while you wait')",
      "Consider focusing on one strong follow-up question rather than splitting between 'who said it' and 'when' - perhaps combine into 'Who said it and when do you have to talk?'"
