      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'That's the worst feeling' and reassuring normalization ('It's happened to almost everyone')",
      "Excellent specific, actionable advice with exact phrases to use like 'Let me think about that for a second' and 'Wow, my mind just went blank — can I come back to that?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses structured bullet points with bold headers ('Buy a moment:', 'Breathe:', 'Admit it lightly:') instead of natural prose paragraphs, creating a self-help article feel rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') and uses impersonal constructions like 'our memory' and 'our brains' instead",
      "Fails to end with a follow-up question to continue the conversation, closing with the statement 'You've got this' instead of engaging the user further"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific, realistic phrases and strategies that a teen can actually use in the moment",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - relies on a formatted bulleted list with bold headers, which significantly diverges from the conversational paragraph style required",

      "notes": "Response uses a bulleted list with bold headers which creates a structured, instructional feel. The advice should be woven into natural sentences flowing within paragraphs rather than listed as discrete options."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose paragraphs: instead of listing options with headers, weave them naturally like 'If it happens again, I'd suggest buying a moment by saying something like... You could also try taking a quick breath... And honestly, if you really blank, just admitting it lightly works too...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: use 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' instead of 'our brains' or 'our memory' - for example, 'I know my brain does that under pressure' or 'I'd probably say something like...'",
      "End with a specific, engaging follow-up question to invite continued conversation, such as 'Has this happened to you before, or was this the first time?' or 'How did you handle it after you blanked?'"
