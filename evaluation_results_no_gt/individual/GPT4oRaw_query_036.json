      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads like a natural text message",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging question that invites the teen to share more about their specific situation ('Want to share a bit more about why you feel that way?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it,' or 'I'm here' which makes it feel impersonal despite being casual",
      "No practical advice or actionable suggestions provided - only validation without any 'here's what you could do' component",
      "Too brief for the emotional weight of the topic - only 2-3 sentences feels potentially dismissive"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: try 'I totally get why that would feel stressful' or 'I'd probably feel the same way in your shoes' instead of distant observations",
      "Include 1-2 sentences of practical advice after validation, such as specific ways to approach the friend or observe the situation, before asking the follow-up question",
      "Expand slightly to 3-4 sentences total so it doesn't feel rushed - maybe add one emoji like 😬 or 💙 to enhance warmth given the brevity"
