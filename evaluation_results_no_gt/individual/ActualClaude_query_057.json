    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and acknowledging the unfairness",
      "Uses natural teen-appropriate casual language like 'what actually went down' and 'got in trouble'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel like general observations rather than a personal conversation",
      "Very limited practical advice - only suggests venting/talking through it without specific strategies for handling the detention or teacher",
      "Ends with a statement about venting rather than a question to continue the conversation"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout, such as 'I totally get why you're upset' or 'I'd be so annoyed too' to create personal connection",
      "End with a specific question like 'Do you think you'll try to talk to the teacher about it?' instead of a statement",
      "Include one emoji like 😤 or 😅 early in the response to enhance warmth",
      "Offer more concrete advice, such as specific phrases to use when talking to the teacher or ways to make detention less miserable"
