      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I totally get', 'I appreciate') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh' and acknowledging the 'trapped feeling' before offering solutions",

    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one might enhance warmth for this stressful situation (like 😅 or 📱)",
