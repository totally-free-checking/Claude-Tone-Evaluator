      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I'm sorry','I'm here to listen','I've got you') creating genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks a specific follow-up question at the end—ends with offers to help rather than an engaging question to continue the conversation",
      "Practical advice is vague and deferred ('if you want some tips... I've got you') rather than offering one concrete immediate strategy for the panic",

      "Consider adding slightly more specific emotional validation like 'That post-test dread is the worst' to show you really get the specific feeling"
