      "Opens with immediate, warm validation using 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'stomach-drop moment' that perfectly captures the teen's emotional experience",
      "Uses natural first-person advice format ('If I were you, I'd...') that feels like a supportive friend sharing personal perspective rather than dispensing generic tips",

      "Could include one more explicit first-person validation statement like 'I get how that feels' in the middle section to strengthen the personal connection",
