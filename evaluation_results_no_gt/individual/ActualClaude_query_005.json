      "Opens with strong validation using casual language ('Ugh, rumors are the worst!') and empathy ('I'm sorry you're dealing with that')",
      "Follow-up questions are natural and context-specific ('Is this happening at school, work, or in your friend group?') showing genuine interest",
      "Practical advice is realistic and teen-appropriate, covering specific scenarios like rallying real friends and not fueling the fire"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet-point structure with the phrase 'Here are some approaches that often work:' followed by 5 categorized bullet sections, reading like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice sections - uses impersonal imperatives ('consider having,' 'Ask people,' 'Try not to') instead of 'I think you should' or 'I'd try'",
      "Emotional validation is brief (only the first sentence) before jumping immediately to structured solutions, creating an imbalanced feel"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - ends with natural, specific questions that invite the teen to share more details about their situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the response is structured as a listicle with headers and sub-bullets rather than conversational paragraphs",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as natural prose paragraphs instead of bullet categories, flowing ideas together as a friend would text ('I think addressing it directly could help, but keep it calm...')",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout the advice using 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'In my opinion' rather than generic imperative statements",
      "Weave emotional validation throughout the response rather than isolating it to the first sentence, and combine the practical tips into 2-3 flowing paragraphs without headers or bullet points"
