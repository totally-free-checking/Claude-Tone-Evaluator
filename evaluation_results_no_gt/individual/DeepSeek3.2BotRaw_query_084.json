      "Excellent natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structured lists - reads like a text message",

      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think', 'I'd feel', or 'I get it' to create personal connection",
      "Minimal practical advice or actionable suggestions for handling the grounding or processing the unfairness",

      "Consider slightly more elaboration on validation before the question to show deeper engagement with their feelings"
