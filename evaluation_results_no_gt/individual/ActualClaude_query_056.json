      "Provides concrete, actionable advice with specific phrases the teen can use like 'How can I best support you right now?'",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers (**Simple but meaningful things:**, **Practical support:**, **If it seems serious:**) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language (no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I'm here'), making it feel impersonal and instructional",
      "Emotional validation is brief and perfunctory before immediately jumping into structured solution lists"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers specific, realistic actions a teen can actually take like bringing food, running errands, or suggesting professional help",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - uses three separate bulleted sections with bold headers instead of conversational paragraphs, reading like a checklist",

      "notes": "Response contains three bold headers with approximately 10 bullet points total. Only the opening two sentences and closing two sentences are in prose form; the majority is heavily structured lists."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert all bullet points into natural prose paragraphs that flow like a text conversation, integrating the advice into sentences rather than lists",
      "Add first-person perspective using phrases like 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get how overwhelming that feels' to create a personal, supportive connection rather than an instructional tone",
      "Expand the emotional validation at the beginning to better balance support with solutions - spend more time acknowledging how hard it is to see a friend struggle before offering fixes"
