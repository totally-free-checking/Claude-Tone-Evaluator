      "Excellent immediate validation with specific emotional acknowledgment ('That feeling of not having any say in your own plans is honestly the worst')",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') that creates genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for the conversation with mom including exact phrasing they can use"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched to the frustration level of the situation (nervous laughter emoji vs. anger/frustration)",
      "Could slightly expand validation of the autonomy violation before moving to 'parents do this' normalization, though it does acknowledge 'That doesn't make it right'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with advice flowing organically within conversational paragraphs",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😊 or 💙 instead of 😅 for frustrating situations involving lack of agency, as 😅 implies nervous laughter which may not match the teen's anger",
      "The phrase 'Setting that boundary early' is slightly clinical/therapy-speak; could soften to 'Laying that out now' or 'Getting ahead of this' to maintain the casual friend tone"
