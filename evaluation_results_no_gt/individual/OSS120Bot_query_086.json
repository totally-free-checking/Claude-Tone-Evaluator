      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using relatable casual language ('Ugh, that feeling... is the worst', 'cringe-fest episodes') that normalizes the experience",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact scripts to use ('yeah, that was awkward, sorry about that') and concrete grounding activities (walk, favorite song, texting)",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up consists of two questions rather than one focused inquiry, which slightly splits the conversational focus",

      "Strengthen first-person voice in the advice section by using phrases like 'I'd suggest giving yourself...' or 'I think a quick walk...' instead of impersonal directives to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consolidate the final two questions into one focused inquiry (e.g., 'What exactly happened, and how are you feeling about it now?') or choose the most engaging single question to maintain conversational focus"
