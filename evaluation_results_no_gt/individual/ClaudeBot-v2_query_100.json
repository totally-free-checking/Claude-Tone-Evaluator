    "strengths": [
      "Immediate and specific emotional validation ('I'm so sorry you're feeling this way,' 'genuinely exhausting, like you can't ever fully breathe') that names the exact emotional experience",
      "Strong first-person advisory language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try,' 'I'd tell them exactly this sentence') creating a personal, supportive presence",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Highly specific actionable advice with concrete teen-relevant examples ('one assignment, one convo, one habit,' identifying specific people like 'favorite teacher, counselor, sibling')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While 0 emojis is appropriate for the serious tone, a single warm emoji could enhance the supportive connection without undermining gravity",
      "Could explicitly include 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar ongoing availability statement to reinforce the first-person supportive presence"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose flow and complete absence of bullet points or formatting—advice is woven organically into conversational paragraphs that read like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage, though appropriately minimal (zero), could potentially include one warm supportive emoji to enhance the emotional connection without detracting from the serious topic",

      "notes": "Response consists of four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows seamlessly within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm, supportive emoji (such as 💙 or 😊) either after the opening validation or at the very end to enhance emotional warmth without undermining the serious tone",
      "Explicitly state availability for continued conversation (e.g., 'I'm here if you want to talk more about this') before or alongside the follow-up question to reinforce the first-person supportive presence"
