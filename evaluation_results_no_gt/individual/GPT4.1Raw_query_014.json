      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses 'It can feel' and 'might help' instead of 'I get how awkward that is' or 'I'd probably feel torn'",

      "Add first-person language to create connection: instead of 'It can feel awkward,' try 'I totally get how awkward that feels' or 'I'd be so torn in that spot'",

      "Make the follow-up question more specific to their situation rather than generic: 'Do you think they realize they told you, or did it slip out accidentally?'"
