    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts the teen can use with their mom, such as 'I need you to ask me before signing me up for things'",
      "Offers practical, actionable steps for different scenarios including cancellation and privacy protection",
      "Asks relevant contextual questions to tailor advice (what was signed up for, age, payment method)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely heavy use of bullet points and numbered lists (over 10 bullets) instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Minimal emotional validation - only 'That's really frustrating' before jumping to practical questions and advice",
      "Lacks first-person empathetic language like 'I get it' or 'I'd feel the same way', using 'I' only in functional contexts",
      "Reads like an instructional guide or wiki article rather than a conversation with a supportive friend"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality and specific communication scripts provided are realistic and immediately actionable for a teen in this situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is almost entirely bullet points and numbered lists, completely lacking the natural prose paragraph style required for a conversational teen support bot",

      "notes": "Response uses a 3-bullet question list, 5 numbered steps with sub-bullets each, and minimal connecting prose. Reads as a structured guide rather than a text conversation."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite as 2-3 natural paragraphs without bullet points, flowing validation into advice conversationally",
      "Add genuine emotional validation upfront like 'Ugh, that's such a violation of your autonomy' or 'I get why you'd feel disrespected'",
      "Use first-person empathetic language like 'I'd be so annoyed too' or 'I think the best approach is...' to create connection",
      "Reduce the initial question barrage to one natural follow-up question at the end, such as 'What did she sign you up for, if you don't mind me asking?'"
