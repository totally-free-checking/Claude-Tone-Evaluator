    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads as a natural, flowing conversation rather than a structured guide",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('It's totally understandable to feel anxious') and normalization ('you're definitely not alone') which creates safety"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language and personal voice - missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it,' or 'I'm here' statements that would make it feel like a real person connecting rather than generic advice",
      "Practical advice is vague and generic ('share what you're feeling,' 'willing to work on improving') without specific phrases or concrete scripts the teen could actually use",
      "Follow-up question is transactional and yes/no ('Would you like some ideas...') rather than an engaging, specific question about their situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, creating a conversational text-like flow",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective and personal voice - the response never shares 'I' perspectives like 'I think' or 'I'd feel the same way,' making it feel impersonal despite being warm",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, or bold text. The response flows as natural paragraphs throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person empathetic statements like 'I get why you're dreading this' or 'I'd feel sick to my stomach too' to create a personal connection",
      "Replace the yes/no closing question with an open-ended, specific question like 'What do you think they'll be most upset about - the grade itself or that you didn't tell them right away?'",
      "Include one concrete script example in the initial response rather than only offering to provide ideas later, such as 'You could try saying: I need to tell you something that I'm really anxious about...'"
