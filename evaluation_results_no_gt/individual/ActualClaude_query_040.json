    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts the teen can actually use like 'Hey, I appreciate you reaching out, but I need some space to respond'",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question about the relationship type that shows genuine interest and helps tailor future advice",
      "Offers realistic, immediately actionable suggestions that respect teen agency (Do Not Disturb settings, specific texting frequency boundaries)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers (**Direct but kind:**, **Set specific boundaries:**) instead of conversational prose paragraphs",
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I'm here if you need to talk' which makes it feel impersonal rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Emotional validation is brief (only one sentence) before immediately jumping to structured advice lists, creating an imbalanced feel"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question at the end is perfectly executed - it's specific, natural, and invites the teen to share more context without being generic",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is extremely over-structured with four separate bold headers and multiple bullet lists, reading like a self-help article rather than a text conversation with a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response uses four bold header sections (**Direct but kind:**, **Set specific boundaries:**, etc.) with multiple bullet points under each. Only the opening and closing sentences are prose. This is the opposite of the ideal conversational paragraph format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of listing options, weave them into sentences like 'I'd probably start by saying something like...' or 'You could try telling them...'",
      "Add first-person connection throughout - use phrases like 'I get how overwhelming that feels', 'I'd say the best approach is...', or 'I'm here if you need to talk through it more' to sound like a real person rather than an advice column",
      "Expand the emotional validation section before giving advice - spend a paragraph acknowledging how stressful and suffocating constant notifications feel before moving to solutions"
