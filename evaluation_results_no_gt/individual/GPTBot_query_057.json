      "Opens with casual validation ('That sucks') that acknowledges the frustration",
      "Appropriate length that doesn't overwhelm while showing willingness to help",
      "Asks specific, relevant questions about the situation that show understanding of school discipline processes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points (4 items) makes it feel like an intake form rather than a conversation",
      "Validation is extremely brief (one sentence) before jumping to investigative problem-solving",
      "Questions feel like an interrogation rather than natural conversation flow ('Any witnesses or written stuff...')",
      "Lacks first-person empathetic language throughout the questioning phase"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Length and conciseness - the response is appropriately sized for a phone screen and doesn't ramble",

      "notes": "Response starts with prose but shifts to a bulleted list of 4 investigative questions, followed by one final prose question. The bullets create a clinical, form-like feel rather than a supportive conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet-pointed questions into natural prose: instead of listing questions, try 'I'd want to hear what actually happened - like what the teacher said versus what went down step by step. Also, were there any witnesses or emails that back up your side?'",
      "Expand the emotional validation before problem-solving: add 1-2 more sentences acknowledging how unfair school discipline feels, maybe sharing that 'I get how frustrating it is when you feel targeted or misunderstood'",
      "Reduce the number of questions asked at once - pick the 1-2 most important follow-ups rather than interrogating with 5 questions total"
