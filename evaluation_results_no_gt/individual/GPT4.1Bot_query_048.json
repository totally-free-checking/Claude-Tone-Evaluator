      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I know that punch-in-the-gut feeling', 'If I were you, I'd try to remember', 'venting to a friend (or to me!)') creates genuine connection",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that really sucks' and vivid empathy ('makes you feel invisible or like nothing you do is enough')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—flows like a natural text conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could include specific script examples for what to say to parents doing the comparing (e.g., 'It hurts when you compare us')",

      "Consider adding one specific script example for setting boundaries, such as: 'You could try saying something like, \"I know you don't mean to, but when you compare me to [sibling], it makes me feel like I'm not good enough\"'",
      "The response is strong enough that adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) at the end of the first paragraph could enhance emotional connection without feeling forced, though the current no-emoji approach works for the serious tone"
