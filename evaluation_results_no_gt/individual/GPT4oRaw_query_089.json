    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong first-person connection with phrases like 'I totally get' and 'I'm here to help' that create genuine support",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen procrastination (10-15 minute timer, one small task) rather than generic platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could deepen emotional validation slightly by naming the specific feeling (e.g., 'that panicky feeling when you realize everything is due')",
      "Lacks first-person advisory framing in the middle section - uses 'you can' and 'try focusing' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could'",
      "Missing a warm emoji that could enhance the 'Oh no' opening sentiment (though zero emojis is acceptable)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining readability",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "First-person language in the advice section - while it opens and closes with 'I', the practical suggestions are delivered impersonally ('try focusing', 'you can set') rather than as personal recommendations ('I'd suggest focusing', 'I usually set a timer')",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, numbered lists, or headers. Uses natural paragraph transitions like 'First,' and 'And hey,' to guide the conversation without structural formatting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 😊) to match the 'Oh no' sentiment and enhance visual warmth",
      "Frame the practical advice using first-person language like 'What helps me is...' or 'I'd suggest starting with...' to maintain the conversational friend-to-friend tone throughout",
      "Deepen the initial validation by acknowledging the specific emotional weight ('that sinking feeling when you realize how much has piled up') before moving to 'the good news'"
