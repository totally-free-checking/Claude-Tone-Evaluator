      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",

      "Advice could be more specific - suggests 'reaching out' but doesn't offer concrete phrases or scripts the teen could actually use",
      "Lacks emoji that could enhance warmth for this anxious situation (though none is acceptable)",
