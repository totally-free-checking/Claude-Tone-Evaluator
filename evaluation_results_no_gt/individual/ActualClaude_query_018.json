      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with that' and specifically naming the 'stressed, helpless feeling'",
      "Practical advice is realistic and teen-appropriate (headphones, texting friends, emphasizing it's not their fault)",
      "Good follow-up questions that show genuine interest in their specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bulleted list for advice instead of natural prose flow ('A few things that might help in the moment:' followed by 3 bullets)",
      "Lacks first-person language when giving suggestions (says 'A few things that might help' instead of 'I think you could try' or 'I'd suggest')",
      "Slightly formal structure with 'A few things that might help' rather than conversational flow"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The emotional validation at the beginning perfectly captures the warm, empathetic tone needed for this sensitive situation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points to flowing prose: 'If you can, I'd suggest putting on headphones or playing some music to drown it out. Maybe text a friend or find something to distract yourself. And remember - their fighting isn't your fault or responsibility.'",
      "Add first-person perspective to advice: Instead of 'A few things that might help,' try 'I think the best thing you can do right now is...' or 'I'd probably put on headphones...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the start (like 💙 or 😔) to enhance the supportive tone, though this is optional for such a serious topic"
