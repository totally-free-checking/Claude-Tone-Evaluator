    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get that', 'I think', 'If I were you', 'I might start') which creates genuine connection and warmth",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong validation sequence that normalizes the feeling before offering the insightful reframe that a 'thing' doesn't have to be a talent but could be character traits like listening or humor"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks an emoji that could have enhanced warmth for this emotionally vulnerable topic (though the absence isn't harmful)",
      "The phrase 'If I were you, I might start' is slightly wordy - 'I'd probably just try' would feel more casual and immediate"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose flow and conversational structure - it avoids all bullet points and headers while maintaining clear organization through paragraph breaks, reading exactly like a supportive older sibling or friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The complete absence of emojis when one gentle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response could have enhanced the warm, validating tone for this specific topic about feeling left out",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to visually signal safety and warmth for this vulnerable admission",
      "Try slightly more casual phrasing like 'I'd probably just' instead of 'If I were you, I might start' to reduce wordiness and increase immediacy",
      "The reframe about 'your thing' being character traits rather than skills is excellent - lean into this type of perspective-shifting advice more often"
