    "strengths": [
      "Provides excellent specific scripts and phrases the teen can actually use with parents (e.g., 'It's just a friend. I'm not doing anything unsafe, but I'd like some privacy in my conversations')",
      "Ends with a strong, specific follow-up question asking about age range and parent reactions to help tailor future advice",
      "Acknowledges different contexts (under 18 vs older, online friends vs school friends) which shows nuanced understanding"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely over-structured with headers, numbered lists (1-5), and bullet points making it read like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Lacks emotional validation - doesn't acknowledge how frustrating or invasive it feels to have parents constantly asking; jumps immediately to explaining parents' perspective and solutions",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - feels impersonal and instructional rather than like a friend texting",
      "Uses formal formatting like '###' headers and bold text (**1) Reassure + set a boundary**) which breaks conversational flow"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific, realistic scripts and actionable strategies for handling the situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose vs bullets - the response is heavily structured with approximately 12+ bullet points across multiple numbered sections and headers, reading like a guide rather than natural conversation",

      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 5 numbered sections with multiple bullet points under each, plus additional bullet sections under 'If they keep pushing' and 'Quick reality check'. Only 2-3 short paragraphs of actual prose at beginning and end."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 flowing paragraphs of natural prose instead of using numbered lists and bullet points - advice should flow within sentences like 'I think I'd try saying something like...' rather than 'Option 1: Reassure + set a boundary'",
      "Start with immediate emotional validation before any advice: 'Ugh, that's so annoying - you deserve some privacy and it's totally normal to feel defensive when they ask constantly'",
      "Add first-person language throughout: 'I get why that feels invasive', 'I'd probably start by saying...', 'I think the key here is...' to create connection rather than sounding like an instruction manual",
      "Remove all headers (###), bold text, and numbered lists - format it like you're texting a friend, not writing a guide"
