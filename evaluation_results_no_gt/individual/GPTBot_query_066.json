    "strengths": [
      "Excellent specific techniques like the physiological sigh and 5-4-3-2-1 grounding that are immediately actionable and realistic for teens",
      "Includes a safety check at the end asking about self-harm thoughts with offer to help find immediate support",
      "Follow-up questions are specific and tailored to differentiate between racing thoughts vs physical anxiety and timing of symptoms"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely over-structured with headers (###), bold text, and numbered lists instead of conversational prose - reads like a medical pamphlet rather than a text from a friend",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I get it,' 'I've been there,' or 'I'd say' to create personal connection",
      "Opens with clinical explanation ('nervous system is stuck in high alert') rather than warm emotional validation like 'Ugh, that feeling is the worst' or 'I'm sorry you're dealing with that'",
      "Tone is educational/instructional rather than empathetic - focuses on 'here are techniques' without first acknowledging the emotional weight"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality - the specific techniques (physiological sigh, brain dump with timer, worry appointment) are concrete, evidence-based, and realistic for a teen to implement immediately",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting and prose style - using headers, numbered lists, and bullet points instead of natural conversational paragraphs makes it feel like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses ### headers, **bold labels**, numbered lists (1-4), and bullet dashes throughout. Only the opening sentence and safety check are in prose. Reads like a wikiHow article or clinical handout rather than a text conversation. The advice is embedded in instructional formatting rather than flowing naturally within paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in conversational paragraphs without any headers, bold text, or numbered lists - flow the advice naturally using transitions like 'You could try...' or 'Something that helps me is...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout: 'I totally get that feeling,' 'I'd start by...,' 'I think the best thing...' to create the sense of talking to a supportive friend rather than reading a manual",
      "Move emotional validation to the very beginning with warm, casual language like 'Ugh, that brain-spinning feeling is the absolute worst' before offering any techniques",
      "Add one appropriate emoji early (like 😅 or 💙) to set a warm, casual tone, and reduce the clinical terminology like 'physiological sigh' and 'nervous system' to simpler language like 'this breathing trick' or 'when your body is on edge'"
