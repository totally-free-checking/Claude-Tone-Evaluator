    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd maybe try') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation between friends",
      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use ('okay, that's not funny anymore', 'why do you keep saying that?')",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable position to be in' acknowledging the confusion and stress"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for awkwardness, might slightly minimize the seriousness if the situation is actual bullying (though fits the ambiguity described)",
      "Could potentially offer one more sentence of deep emotional validation before transitioning to the 'If I were you' advice section, though the balance is still quite good"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person perspective ('Honestly, I think', 'If I were you, I'd maybe try') making it feel like advice from a supportive friend rather than an impersonal guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use a softer bridge like 'That said' or 'For what it's worth' before jumping into 'If I were you'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief transitional phrase between the validation and advice sections to smooth the shift from 'I hear you' to 'here's what to do'",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, but could be split into two sentences for even more natural pacing rather than the compound question format"
