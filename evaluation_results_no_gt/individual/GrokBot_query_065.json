    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sounds so draining' and acknowledgment of the 'awkward spot' between loyalty and discomfort",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd probably start,' 'I totally get,' 'I love hanging out') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('Eh, I don't really want to get into that,' and 'the gossip stuff isn't my thing')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one might enhance warmth (though the tone remains warm through text alone)",
      "Could potentially benefit from one small emoji (like 😅 or 💙) to match the 'warm, casual' character specification for teen interactions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format and conversational first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any corporate formatting or impersonal 'one should' language",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while the absence doesn't hurt the response, the ideal character typically uses 0-1 emojis for warmth, and this response uses zero where one might have enhanced the supportive tone",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No bullets, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the beginning or end to match the character's typical 0-1 emoji usage for enhanced warmth",
      "The response is exemplary otherwise - maintain this balance of immediate validation, first-person practical advice, and natural follow-up questions"
