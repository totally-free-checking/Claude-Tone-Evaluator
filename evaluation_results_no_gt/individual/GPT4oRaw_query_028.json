    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a text from a friend",
      "Strong follow-up question ('Want to brainstorm what to say together?') that is specific, collaborative, and invites continued conversation",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh no, that happens to the best of us!') that normalizes the experience and validates feelings"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', 'I'm here') which makes the response feel slightly impersonal despite being warm - uses general statements instead of personal perspective",
      "Could benefit from one well-placed emoji (like 😅 or 😊) to enhance the warm, casual tone for this mildly awkward social situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The prose formatting and conversational flow - it avoids all bullet points and headers, reading naturally as a continuous message rather than a structured self-help article",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of first-person language - it uses 'you' statements and general observations rather than 'I think' or 'I'd say' or 'I get it', missing the key characteristic of sounding like a supportive friend sharing their own perspective",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. The advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection - try starting with something like 'Oh no, I totally get that sinking feeling!' or 'I think we've all been there' or 'I'd probably feel the same way'",
      "Consider adding one supportive emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to set a warm, casual tone appropriate for this social situation",
      "The advice is good but could be slightly more specific - maybe mention that even a quick text like 'Hey, I think that came out wrong earlier...' can work"
