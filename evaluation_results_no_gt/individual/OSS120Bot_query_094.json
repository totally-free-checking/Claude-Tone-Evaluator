      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs like 'If you can, try setting a tiny \"reset\" routine...'",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation using empathetic first-person language ('I'm so sorry you're dealing with those pounding headaches') and relatable imagery ('punch to the brain')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses imperative/commands ('try setting', 'Making a habit') rather than first-person suggestions ('I'd suggest', 'I think you should') which would feel more personal and supportive",
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched for the context of physical pain/headaches—it conveys nervous laughter/relief rather than empathy or comfort",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace the 😅 emoji with 💙 or 😔 for physical pain contexts, or omit it entirely, as the sweat-drop smiley suggests nervousness rather than empathy for headaches",
      "Add first-person framing to advice sentences, changing 'try setting a tiny reset routine' to 'I'd suggest trying a tiny reset routine' or 'What helps me is...' to strengthen the personal connection",
      "Consider adding an explicit supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk more about this' to reinforce the first-person supportive presence"
