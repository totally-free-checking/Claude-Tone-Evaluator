    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Oof, that sounds really tough and embarrassing' and 'It's totally normal to feel upset about this - anyone would!'",
      "Good follow-up questions at the end that are specific to the situation ('is this a pattern with this coach or more of a one-off thing?')",
      "Offers realistic, actionable advice for a teen's agency level (talking to teammates, considering a private conversation with coach)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bullet point list ('When you're ready, it might help to think about:' followed by three bullets) instead of natural prose paragraphs as required",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal constructions like 'it might help to think about' and 'sometimes coaches think'",
      "Could benefit from slightly more warmth in the middle section which feels somewhat clinical"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up questions at the end are natural, conversational, and show genuine interest in the specific details of the teen's situation",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The use of bullet points to deliver advice instead of flowing prose paragraphs - this reads like a self-help checklist rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "Uses 'When you're ready, it might help to think about:' followed by a bulleted list of three questions/advice points. This is exactly the red flag pattern mentioned in the instructions ('Here are X ways to handle this:' followed by numbered items). The bullets break the conversational flow and make it feel structured rather than like texting with a friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet point section to natural prose: instead of 'When you're ready, it might help to think about:' followed by bullets, write something like 'I'd suggest taking some time to think about whether this was a specific trigger or if your coach has a habit of being harsh. Maybe you could even have a private conversation with them to clear the air, or talk to teammates you trust for perspective.'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: use phrases like 'I get how humiliating that feels,' 'I'd say give yourself some time to process first,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk more about it.'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the supportive tone, or ensure the language conveys slightly more personal warmth to compensate for the absence of emojis."
