      "Immediate emotional validation with first-person language ('I totally get why you're freaking out') that makes the teen feel understood",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Natural use of collaborative first-person plural ('we can figure this out together', 'let's just think') that creates partnership"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Does not end with a follow-up question (ends with exclamation/statement), missing the opportunity to continue the conversation",
      "Could offer slightly more specific actionable advice (such as asking specific teachers or friends who were nearby)"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - completely avoids bullet points and structured lists, maintaining conversational flow throughout",

      "End the response with an open-ended question to invite the teen to share more (e.g., 'Do you have any idea where you might have left it?' or 'What are you most worried about happening?')",
      "Consider adding one more specific suggestion like asking a teacher who was in the room or texting friends to check if they grabbed it by mistake"
