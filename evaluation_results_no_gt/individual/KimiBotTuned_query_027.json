    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, relatable validation: 'Ugh, that stuck feeling is the worst' followed by acknowledgment that the user wants to do the work but their brain is hitting the 'nope' button",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use when emailing teachers ('I'm really behind and trying to catch up—can I turn it in tomorrow/with a late penalty?') and concrete micro-steps (5-minute setup, titling the doc, copying the prompt)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it'—uses 'What usually helps' and 'Honestly' instead of more personal 'I' statements that would strengthen the connection",
      "The third paragraph is quite long and dense with multiple clauses joined by semicolons, which slightly reduces readability on mobile"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting throughout—no bullet points, numbered lists, bold headers, or excessive formatting. Advice flows naturally within paragraph form using conversational transitions"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add explicit first-person connection phrases like 'I totally get that feeling' or 'I've been there' to make the validation feel more personal rather than observational",
      "Break up the third paragraph into two smaller paragraphs—one focused on the 5-minute start method and another on the teacher communication—to improve mobile readability while maintaining prose format"
