    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'I'm really sorry you had to experience that' and acknowledgment that it's normal to feel upset",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm here to listen,' 'I'm here for you') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring",
      "Realistic and safety-conscious advice that acknowledges the teen's agency ('If you feel safe and comfortable') while offering concrete options like writing thoughts down or speaking with the teacher privately"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The closing engagement is an invitation rather than a specific question ('Let me know if you want advice...') which slightly misses the ideal of ending with a conversational question",
      "Could potentially include one subtle emoji (like 💙) early on to enhance warmth, though the absence is appropriate for the serious topic"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and first-person language that reads like a supportive friend texting rather than an advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up engagement at the end functions as a directive ('Let me know') rather than an open-ended question that invites the teen to share more about their specific situation",

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Transform the closing into a specific question like 'Do you think you'd want to talk to the teacher, or does that feel too hard right now?' to better invite continuation",
      "Consider adding one subtle supportive emoji early in the response (like 💙 after 'I'm really sorry') to enhance warmth, though this is optional given the serious nature of the topic"
