    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - reads like a genuine text conversation",
      "Strong emotional validation with phrases like 'That's a tough spot to be in' and 'your feelings are valid' that acknowledge the discomfort of the situation",
      "Good follow-up questions that are specific to the situation ('Do you have a specific reason for the \"weird vibe,\" or is it more of a general discomfort?') rather than generic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice is vague and lacks specificity - mentions 'talking to your friend' but doesn't provide concrete phrases or scripts the teen could actually use",
      "Missing natural first-person language in the advice portion - uses impersonal statements like 'Trusting your intuition is important' instead of 'I think you should trust your gut' or 'I'd probably start by...'",
      "Tone is slightly formal in places ('whether that's keeping an eye out') rather than using casual teen-appropriate language like 'Ugh, that's so uncomfortable' or 'Honestly, I'd be confused too'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers vague options ('keeping an eye out, talking to your friend') without concrete, actionable steps or specific language the teen could use",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, or over-formatting. Response flows naturally in three short paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add specific first-person reactions and advice using 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' to make it feel more like a supportive friend talking rather than general statements",
      "Provide concrete example phrases for talking to the friend (e.g., 'You could try saying something like, \"Hey, I noticed X and it made me feel weird - is everything okay with you two?\"')",
      "Open with slightly more casual, immediate validation like 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable spot' before moving to the more measured 'tough spot' language"
