    "strengths": [
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I've noticed things feel tense since you checked my phone')",
      "Includes safety considerations and differentiates between various types of 'weird' behavior (angry vs quiet vs restrictive)",
      "The follow-up questions are specific and relevant (asking about age, specific behaviors, and rule changes) rather than generic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal instructional tone ('you can', 'A few things you can do') throughout",
      "Heavy over-formatting with 6 numbered sections, bullet points, and bold text makes it read like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Jumps immediately to solutions after only one sentence of validation - insufficient emotional support upfront"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality is nearly perfect, offering realistic scripts and considering different scenarios a teen might face",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is completely wrong for this character - it uses numbered lists and bullet points extensively instead of natural prose paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "10%",
      "notes": "Response uses a numbered list (1-6) with sub-bullets under most items, plus bold text formatting. Only the opening sentence and final conditional statement are in prose. This is exactly the 'Here are X ways to handle this' format the rubric identifies as a red flag."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely in natural paragraphs without any numbered lists or bullet points - flow the advice conversationally instead of listing it",
      "Add first-person empathetic language throughout ('I think the best approach would be...', 'I'd feel so violated too', 'I'm wondering if...') to create connection",
      "Start with 2-3 sentences of pure emotional validation before offering any advice - acknowledge how invasive and uncomfortable this feels"
