    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific physical description ('knot-in-your-stomach feeling') that shows deep empathy for the experience",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd probably', 'I totally get') creating authentic connection",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Follow-up question offers two specific, natural paths forward (processing content vs. venting feelings) showing genuine interest"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Absence of emojis, while appropriate for the seriousness of the topic, could potentially enhance quick visual warmth for users scanning on phones",
      "Advice could include specific phrase suggestions for what to say if confronted directly (e.g., 'Did you hear us?') to make it even more actionable"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The seamless balance of emotional validation and practical advice - opening with pure empathy ('Ugh, that's honestly the worst'), shifting to perspective ('it almost always feels way bigger'), then offering concrete steps while maintaining supportive language ('You don't owe them any explanation')",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The complete absence of emojis, though this is situationally appropriate for gossip/overhearing content and the warmth is conveyed entirely through text",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure conversational prose throughout all three paragraphs with no formatting structures, headers, or lists - exactly matching the ideal character's natural texting style"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 😔) at the very opening to enhance immediate visual warmth for users who scan quickly, though the text warmth is already strong",
      "Could include a specific script example for what to say if the gossipers confront them directly (e.g., 'Hey, did you hear us?') to make the advice even more immediately usable"
