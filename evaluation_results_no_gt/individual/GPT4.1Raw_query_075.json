    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads like a natural text message",
      "Ends with an engaging question to continue the conversation flow"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I get it', 'I'd feel the same way') making it feel impersonal and detached",
      "Promises advice ('I can give you some tips') but doesn't actually provide any concrete help, leaving the teen hanging",
      "Validation is minimal ('a bit awkward') and quickly pivots to positive reframing without acknowledging the real social anxiety",
      "Too brief for the emotional weight of the situation - risks feeling dismissive"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or headers - maintains conversational flow throughout",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace 'That can feel a bit awkward' with first-person validation like 'Ugh, I totally get that anxiety - I've been in that exact situation and it's so nerve-wracking'",
      "Instead of offering to give tips, immediately provide 1-2 concrete suggestions like mentioning you could text the host beforehand or plan an exit strategy",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) early in the response to set a supportive tone",
      "Expand slightly to validate the feeling more deeply before pivoting to the positive opportunity"
