    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows naturally as a single paragraph of text",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Oh no!' and acknowledging the frustration of not having a say",
      "Uses contractions and casual language (didn't, it's, might've) avoiding formal or clinical tone"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal rather than like a supportive friend texting",
      "Places the follow-up question in the middle ('Do you know what she signed you up for?') rather than ending with it to invite continued conversation",
      "Advice is generic ('have a conversation with her') without specific phrases or concrete steps the teen could actually use"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads like a text message",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person connection language and poor question placement (middle instead of end) failing to establish the supportive 'friend' persona",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Excellent - single paragraph of natural prose with no formatting crutches, though could benefit from being split into 2 paragraphs for better flow"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: 'I totally get why that would be frustrating' or 'I'd feel the same way if my mom did that'",
      "Move the question to the very end to invite continued conversation, and make it more engaging: 'What kind of thing did she sign you up for? And how are you feeling about telling her?'",
      "Provide specific conversation starters: 'You could try saying something like, Mom, I know you were trying to help, but I really wish you'd asked me first because...'"
