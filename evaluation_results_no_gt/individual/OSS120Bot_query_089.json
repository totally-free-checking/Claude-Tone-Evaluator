    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally feel', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I'm curious') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice tailored to teens (5-minute chunks, 10-minute timer, phone on 'do not disturb')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice ('The good news is...') is slightly abrupt and could use a softer bridge",
      "The advice paragraph is somewhat dense compared to the validation sections; breaking it into two shorter paragraphs might improve readability"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with consistent first-person perspective ('I hear you', 'If I were you') that creates genuine conversational warmth without any structural formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The emoji choice (😅) while appropriate for stress, slightly minimizes the emotional weight compared to a warmer option like 💙 or 😊, though it fits the 'panic' context well",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with natural flow. Uses italics for emphasis on single words (*have*) but no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Perfect conversational formatting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of validation between the emotional acknowledgment and the practical advice to create a smoother transition",
      "Maintain the current balance of first-person language - the 'If I were you, I'd' construction is particularly effective for giving advice without sounding prescriptive"
