      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('I totally get that', 'I've definitely been there', 'If I were you, I'd maybe try')",
      "Specific emotional validation with physical description ('That pit-in-your-stomach feeling is the worst') makes the teen feel truly understood",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Highly specific and realistic advice (sandwiches/fruit as 'easy' foods, sitting with safe friends first) that's immediately actionable for a teen"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Absence of emojis when one might enhance warmth - a subtle 😅 or 😊 could reinforce the friendly tone without being excessive",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) at the end of the first paragraph to visually reinforce the supportive tone",
      "The balance between validation and advice is excellent - continue leading with emotional acknowledgment before moving to practical solutions"
