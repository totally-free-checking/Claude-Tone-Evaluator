    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring",
      "Appropriate length that is substantial but not overwhelming - easy to read on a phone",
      "Recognizes the potential seriousness of the situation by mentioning safety/well-being and suggesting trusted adults like parents or counselors"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language and conversational warmth - uses formal phrasing like 'it might be wise to' and 'it's important' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest'",
      "Follow-up question is generic ('How are you feeling about it?') rather than specific to the secret-keeping dilemma",
      "Emotional validation feels distant ('It sounds like you're carrying something heavy') rather than warm and personal ('Ugh, that's such a heavy thing to hold' or 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with this')"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - reads as a continuous conversational paragraph",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Conversational tone and first-person language - the response uses formal, impersonal constructions ('it might be wise to,' 'responsible adult') rather than casual first-person speech that would make it feel like a supportive friend texting",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection - instead of 'it's important to think about why,' try 'I'd really think about why this is bothering you' or 'I get that this feels heavy'",
      "Start with stronger emotional validation before giving advice - acknowledge how hard it is to be in this position before suggesting they talk to adults",
      "Replace the generic follow-up question with something specific to their situation like 'What makes it feel serious?' or 'Do you feel like this is something that could hurt someone?'"
