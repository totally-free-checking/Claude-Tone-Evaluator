      "Excellent first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('I'm so sorry,' 'I think the first step,' 'I'm here to help you figure it out')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural elements—reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledgment that the situation is 'confusing and uncomfortable' before offering any advice",
      "Specific, actionable guidance including exact phrases to use ('Hey, that's not really funny to me,' 'Can you chill with that?') and clear escalation steps"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions rather than one, which slightly dilutes the conversational flow (though both questions are specific and natural)",
      "The emoji, while appropriate, could be considered slightly unnecessary for the serious topic, though its placement at the end softens the closing nicely"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and consistent first-person language throughout, creating an authentic conversational flow that feels like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Having two follow-up questions at the end rather than a single engaging question, which makes the closing feel slightly more like an interview than a natural conversation pause",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider consolidating the two closing questions into one more open-ended question like 'How often is this happening and how are you feeling about confronting them?' to maintain the conversational single-thread feel",
      "The first-person usage is exemplary—continue using 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' and 'I'm here' language to maintain the personal, supportive voice that distinguishes this from generic advice"
