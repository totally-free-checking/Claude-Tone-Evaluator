      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think we're usually way harder on ourselves,' 'I'd say a simple...') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use ('hey, I was thinking about what I said earlier and I'm sorry if it came across wrong') rather than vague advice",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question combines two distinct questions ('What exactly did you say, and how did they react'), which feels slightly less natural than a single focused question",

      "Consider separating the final question into a single focused inquiry like 'What exactly did you say?' rather than combining two questions, which can feel slightly overwhelming",
      "Add explicit first-person availability language like 'I'm here if you need to talk through it more' to reinforce that you're present for ongoing support beyond just this response"
