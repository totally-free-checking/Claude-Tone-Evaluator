    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I hear you', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I'm trying something new') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation between friends",
      "Specific actionable advice including concrete examples (haircut, hair color, clothing) and a ready-to-use social script ('I'm trying something new, what do you think?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'eye-browsing' is slightly awkward/unusual compared to 'eyeing' or 'browsing'",
      "Could potentially offer one more sentence of validation after the practical advice section to bookend the emotional support"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person perspective ('If I were you, I'd start with...') that makes it feel like advice from a supportive friend rather than an impersonal guide",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The reassurance 'most people are way more focused on their own stuff' while true, transitions slightly quickly from deep empathy to logic; could use one more beat of emotional acknowledgment before the reality check",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one brief validating phrase after the practical advice section to reinforce that their fear is still valid even while taking action",
      "The emoji usage (😅) is perfectly placed to convey the nervous-excited feeling of changing one's appearance - maintain this level of restraint (0-1 emojis) for future responses"
