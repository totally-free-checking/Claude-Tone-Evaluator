    "strengths": [
      "Immediate warm validation with 'Ughhh I'm so sorry, that's such a stomach-flip moment' and the relatable 'slow motion' brain replay metaphor",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('how'd you do on the homework/test?' or 'how's your day going?')",
      "Excellent engaging follow-up question that is specific to the situation (asking about eye contact duration)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person framing in the advice section (uses 'you could' instead of 'I think you could' or 'I'd suggest')",
      "Could benefit from one more 'I' statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to reinforce personal connection",
      "The transition from validation to perspective ('it feels way bigger in your head') is slightly quick, though softened by 'Honestly'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with engaging specific follow-up question - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person 'I think' or 'I'd say' language in the advice portion, making suggestions slightly less personal",

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no formatting, no headers, no bold text, and no lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person framing to advice using 'I think' or 'I'd probably' (e.g., 'I think you could test the waters by...') to match the character's voice",
      "Consider adding a brief closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to reinforce the supportive first-person presence",
      "The emoji usage is perfect at one 😅 - maintain this restraint in future responses"
