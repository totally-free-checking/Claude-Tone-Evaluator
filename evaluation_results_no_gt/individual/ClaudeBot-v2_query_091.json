      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledging the 'gross, heavy feeling' of being used",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I'm so sorry') that creates genuine connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji placement after 'wonder what was real' feels slightly mismatched with the serious emotional weight of betrayal and being used",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider replacing 😅 with 😔 or 💙, or removing it entirely, as the 'nervous laughter' emoji doesn't quite fit the gravity of feeling used by a friend",
      "Add one brief transitional sentence between the validation ('you deserve friendships...') and the advice ('If I were you...') to make the shift feel more organic"
