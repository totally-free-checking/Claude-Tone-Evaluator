      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst!' and acknowledgment of the specific frustration of getting back damaged items",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring",
      "Highly conversational and relatable language like 'Are you doing the thing where...' that captures how teens actually talk",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') - uses only impersonal/general statements like 'There's something frustrating' and 'Friends should'",
      "Does not end with a question to continue the conversation; closes with a definitive statement about friendship instead",

      "Add first-person language to create stronger connection, such as 'I'd be so upset too' or 'I think you have every right to say something'",
      "End with a specific question to invite continuation, such as 'Do you think you'll say something or just let it go?' or 'How bad was the damage?'",
      "Consider offering one concrete script for confrontation, like 'If you decide to speak up, you could try saying: Hey, I noticed this got damaged when you borrowed it...'"
