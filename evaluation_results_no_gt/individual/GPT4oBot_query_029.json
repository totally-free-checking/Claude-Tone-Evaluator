      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that really sucks, I'm so sorry' and acknowledging how small public call-outs can make you feel",

      "Could strengthen first-person perspective in the advice section - uses 'maybe you could' and 'that way you're showing' rather than 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could try'",
