      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice is somewhat generic - suggests 'talking calmly' and 'showing responsibility' without specific conversation starters or concrete examples",
      "Transitions quickly from validation to advice without fully exploring the emotional weight of the situation first"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - perfectly conversational paragraph structure without any bullet points, headers, or over-formatting that reads like a genuine text conversation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding specific conversation starters like 'Hey, I've noticed things feel different lately and I wanted to check in...' to make the advice more immediately actionable",
      "Could deepen validation by acknowledging specific feelings (like feeling trapped or misunderstood) before moving to the solution phase",
      "While no emoji is acceptable for this serious topic, a single gentle emoji like 😕 or 💙 at the end could enhance warmth without undermining the seriousness"
