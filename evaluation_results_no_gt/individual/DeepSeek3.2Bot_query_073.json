    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that is so draining' and acknowledging the desire to stop sharing",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I might try', 'I've noticed', 'I'd say') creating authentic connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I'm just trying to vent right now, I'm not looking to compare'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😓 or 😅) at the opening to enhance visual warmth, though the absence is acceptable for this topic",
      "The explanation about the friend being insecure, while helpful, could be framed slightly more tentatively to avoid sounding presumptuous about the friend's motivations"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in flowing paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriate to have none for this slightly serious topic, a single emoji could have enhanced the warm tone slightly",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or bullet lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji at the start (like 😓) to match the 'Ugh' sentiment and enhance visual warmth",
      "The follow-up question 'What kinds of things does your friend turn into a competition most often?' is excellent - specific and natural"
