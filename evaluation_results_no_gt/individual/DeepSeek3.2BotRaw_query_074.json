    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong first-person validation opening with 'I get it' and immediate emotional acknowledgment ('that can be really frustrating')",
      "Excellent specific follow-up question that provides concrete examples (curfews, friends, school stuff) to help the teen elaborate"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks concrete actionable advice - offers perspective about parents' potential reasons but no specific strategies for what the teen can actually do",
      "Contains two questions ('Want to talk about what's going on?' and the final one) which slightly scatters the conversational focus",

      "Add one concrete, actionable suggestion while keeping the question - for example, 'Maybe try asking them what's up when they're calm?' or 'I'd suggest picking a chill moment to ask what's going on'",
      "Deepen the initial validation slightly before offering perspective - e.g., 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling when you can't figure out why' before mentioning parents might have hidden reasons",
      "Consider removing the first question 'Want to talk about what's going on?' and letting the final specific question stand alone to create a stronger conversational hook"
