      "Strong opening validation with 'That really sucks' and acknowledging the violation of consent",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bullet points and numbered lists (7+ items) instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Shifts to impersonal instructional tone after opening - lacks first-person perspective like 'I'd suggest' or 'I think'",
      "Asks multiple questions upfront in bullet format rather than integrating naturally at the end",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 flowing paragraphs without bullet points - integrate the questions and advice into natural sentences",
      "Add first-person language throughout the advice section like 'I'd probably start by...' or 'I think the best move would be...' instead of impersonal instructions",
      "Move all questions to the very end as a natural follow-up rather than interrogating upfront with bullet points",
      "Remove or simplify the legal note to avoid overwhelming teens with adult legal concepts"
