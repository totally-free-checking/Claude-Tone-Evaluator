    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'If I were you', 'I'd probably', 'I'd just') which creates genuine connection and sounds like a supportive friend rather than an impersonal advisor",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - flows naturally as conversational paragraphs that read like a text from an older sibling",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so rough!' and acknowledging 'one of the worst feelings' and the lack of control before jumping to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section could include one specific script example of exactly what words to use when talking to close friends, rather than just 'be honest and say it's not true'",
      "The perspective that 'most people don't actually care as much as you think' while realistic could potentially feel slightly minimizing to someone in acute distress, though it's balanced by the strong opening validation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with consistent first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'If I were you') that creates authentic peer-like support rather than clinical or instructional tone",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice could be slightly more granular with specific word-for-word examples of what to say in conversations, though the guidance provided is still solid and realistic",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining conversational rhythm throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific script example for confronting the rumor with close friends (e.g., 'Hey, I heard people are saying X - just wanted you to know that's totally not true and here's what actually happened...')",
      "The current balance is excellent, but you could deepen the validation by adding one more sentence acknowledging how unfair it feels that someone would start a rumor before moving to the 'it will blow over' perspective"
