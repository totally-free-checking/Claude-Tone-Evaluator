    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think it's super common', 'I'd maybe try') creating genuine connection rather than impersonal advice",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation ('That sounds so draining, honestly') that acknowledges the exhaustion before offering any solutions",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural conversational flow - reads like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured self-help guide"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice slightly mismatches the 'draining' emotional context (typically implies nervous laughter/embarrassment rather than empathy for exhaustion)",
      "Could more explicitly validate the 'stuck' feeling mentioned in the query, though 'caught in the middle' partially addresses this"

      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph format throughout with natural transitions between validation and advice; no headers, bold text, or list formatting used"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using an emoji that better matches the emotional weight of exhaustion (like 😔, 💙, or simply omitting) rather than 😅 which implies nervousness",
      "Explicitly name-check the 'stuck' feeling from their query ('feeling trapped in the middle') to show you heard that specific detail before moving to advice"
