      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ughhh that's such an annoying one' and 'Totally fair to be bothered even if it feels \"small\"' which normalizes their feelings without dismissing them",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs like 'If you've got even a little time, you could ask a friend...'",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact scripts like 'I forgot my lunch—any chance you can drop it off or send money?' that teens can actually use immediately"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it' - uses observational 'you' statements instead of personal 'I' perspective, making it slightly less intimate than the ideal",
      "Could include slightly more explicit supportive closing language like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to reinforce the supportive relationship"

    "least_ideal_aspect": "Missing first-person 'I' statements (e.g., 'I think,' 'I'd say') which makes the advice feel slightly more observational than personal",

      "Add first-person framing to advice sections, such as changing 'you could ask a friend' to 'I'd probably ask a friend' or 'I think you could try asking' to create stronger personal connection",
      "Consider adding a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar first-person supportive closing before the follow-up question to reinforce the supportive bot character"
