    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get that', 'I think the key is', 'I find that physical stuff helps') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs like 'Maybe try doing something that requires just enough attention to pull you out of the spiral'",
      "Strong immediate validation using relatable metaphors ('It's like your mind is running a marathon you never signed up for') and normalizing language ('totally normal', 'literally everyone')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice section could include one specific grounding technique with brief explanation of why it works neurologically, rather than just listing activities",
      "The emoji 😅 captures the awkwardness well but a 💙 or 😊 might have conveyed warmth more clearly for stress specifically, though this is minor"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with no structural formatting or lists",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice could be slightly more specific about implementation (e.g., explaining the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique or box breathing rather than just 'listening to music')",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with natural transitions between validation, normalization, advice, and engagement. No headers, bold text, or list formatting used."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one evidence-based grounding technique explanation (like box breathing or the 5-4-3-2-1 method) with a brief 'why this works' to make the advice more actionable",
      "The response is excellent overall - maintain this exact balance of first-person validation followed by realistic teen-appropriate suggestions"
