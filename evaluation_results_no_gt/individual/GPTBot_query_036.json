      "Excellent specific advice with concrete scripts the teen can use (e.g., 'I'm worried because I saw/heard ___, and it didn't sit right with me')",
      "Strong follow-up questions at the end that are specific to the situation and show genuine interest in helping further",
      "Comprehensive coverage of safety concerns and red flags, showing appropriate seriousness about potential danger"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Extremely heavy formatting with 6 numbered sections, markdown headers (###), and multiple bullet point lists makes it read like a wiki article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Lacks first-person conversational language (no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it') - feels impersonal and instructional rather than like texting with a friend",
      "Minimal emotional validation before diving into extensive advice - only one sentence of validation before 6 sections of solutions",
      "Overwhelming length and structure for a teen reading on a phone - feels like a manual rather than a chat"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides extremely specific, actionable guidance with exact phrases to use and realistic safety considerations",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - uses extensive bullet points, numbered lists, and headers instead of natural conversational paragraphs, reading like an advice article rather than a supportive text",

      "notes": "Response uses 6 numbered sections with markdown headers (###), extensive bullet lists under sections 2-6, and sub-bullet points. Only the opening sentence and final paragraph are prose. Reads as a structured guide rather than natural conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the 6 numbered sections into 2-3 flowing paragraphs that blend validation with advice naturally, like 'I think I'd start by getting clear on why you don't trust them...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get how stressful that is') to create a personal connection rather than sounding like an instruction manual",
      "Move the extensive red flag list and boundary scripts into conversational sentences rather than bullet points - e.g., 'If you're seeing things like isolation or threats, that changes things completely...'",
      "Start with more emotional validation before offering solutions - acknowledge how hard it is to watch a friend in this situation and validate that their instincts matter"
