    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's such a gut-punch feeling' and labeling the 'convenience friend' dynamic, which immediately makes the user feel seen",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact scripts like 'Hey, I've got you, but I've been feeling like we only connect when there's a crisis/ask' and 'I'm tapped out right now'",
      "Strong follow-up question that offers two specific conversational paths (venting vs. finding new friends) rather than generic 'How are you?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Complete absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - the response uses impersonal constructions like 'It might help to...' and 'You've got options' instead of personal perspective",
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers (3 bullet questions plus 3 bold-header advice sections) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Lacks emoji when one (like 😔 or 💙) could have enhanced the warm, empathetic tone at the beginning"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The emotional validation and specific practical advice - it perfectly captures the 'gut-punch' feeling of being used and offers realistic scripts a teen could actually use",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting structure - using bullet points and bold headers ('**The gentle test:**') instead of natural prose paragraphs makes it feel like an article rather than a supportive friend texting",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response contains 3 bullet points in the 'questions to chew on' section and 3 bold-header sections for advice categories. This heavy structuring disrupts conversational flow and creates distance rather than intimacy. The advice should flow naturally within paragraphs rather than being categorized like a wikiHow article."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace bullet points with flowing prose: Instead of 'A few questions to chew on:' followed by bullets, write 'I'd start by asking myself a few things. When you reach out just to hang out...' and weave the questions naturally into paragraphs",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: Change 'It might help to get clarity' to 'I think it might help to get some clarity' and 'You've got options' to 'I'd say you have a few options here' to create personal connection",
      "Remove bold headers and integrate advice naturally: Instead of '**The gentle test:**', write 'One approach I'd try is what I call the gentle test...' and flow into the explanation without formatting breaks"
