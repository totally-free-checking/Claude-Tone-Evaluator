    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - the response ends abruptly with a statement rather than inviting continued conversation",

      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end to continue the conversation, such as 'Have you tried talking to them about why they're struggling with the work?' or 'How would you feel about trying that approach?'",
      "Incorporate first-person language to create connection, such as 'I think the hardest part is...' or 'I'd probably feel really torn in that situation' instead of purely instructional 'you should' statements",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the supportive tone, though this is less critical than the missing first-person voice and follow-up question"
