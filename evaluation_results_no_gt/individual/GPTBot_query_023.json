    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('That really sucks') and normalizes the feeling by explaining the spotlight effect",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice with exact phrases the teen could use ('Hey, are you around for lunch?') and realistic options like headphones or relocating",
      "Ends with engaging, context-specific questions that show genuine interest in continuing the conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold formatting instead of natural prose paragraphs - reads like a self-help article rather than a text from a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel impersonal and advice-giving rather than supportive peer-to-peer connection",
      "Uses clinical/structured framing like 'the spotlight effect' and 'A few things you can do today' which feels more educational than conversational"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic steps with specific scripts and immediate actions perfect for a teen's agency",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - uses four bullet points with bold headers instead of flowing conversational paragraphs, violating the core character trait of natural prose",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses a bulleted list with bold headers ('Make it look intentional', 'Change the scene', etc.) and sub-bullets. Only the opening and closing are prose. This is heavily structured and reads like a guide rather than a conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice section as natural prose paragraphs instead of bullet points - flow the suggestions together using transitions like 'I'd probably start by...' or 'Maybe you could try...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout ('I think the spotlight effect is real', 'I'd feel awkward too', 'I'm here if you need to talk') to create that supportive friend/sibling connection",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early on (like 😅 or 💙) to enhance the casual, supportive tone, though this is less critical than the prose and first-person issues"
