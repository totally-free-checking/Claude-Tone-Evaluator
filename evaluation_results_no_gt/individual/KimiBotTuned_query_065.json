    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally as conversational paragraphs",
      "Strong immediate validation using empathetic language like 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable spot' and 'you're not being dramatic for wanting out of it'",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('I'm not really trying to talk about them like that') and redirection scripts ('Anyway, how'd your test go?')",
      "Engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specifics of the situation rather than a generic 'How are you feeling?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes the advice feel slightly observational rather than personal",
      "Missing warm closing language like 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar personal connection"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - maintains conversational flow throughout while embedding advice naturally within paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective - uses 'you should' and 'it's fair to' rather than 'I think you should' or 'I'd probably just', creating slight distance rather than the 'supportive friend' intimacy",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create more intimacy - instead of 'If you can, try setting...' use 'I think I'd probably just say something like...' or 'Honestly, I'd just set a boundary by saying...'",
      "Include a brief personal connection at the end like 'I'm here if you need to talk through it more' or 'I get how awkward that feels' to reinforce the supportive friend persona"
