    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring - reads like a natural text message",
      "Uses first-person language naturally ('I'm here to listen') creating personal connection",
      "Asks specific, contextual questions to determine if the teen wants to vent or needs advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Too brief for the emotional weight of the situation - only 2 sentences feels potentially dismissive of how hurtful overhearing gossip can be",
      "Validation is tentative and clinical ('might have been uncomfortable') rather than definitive empathy ('Ugh, that's such a sinking feeling')",
      "Asks two questions at once ('what did you overhear?' and 'are you more wondering...') which can feel slightly overwhelming"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains perfect conversational flow",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Excellent - pure paragraph form with no lists, headers, or bold text. Reads like a natural message from a friend."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand the validation section before asking questions - acknowledge how awful that sinking feeling is when you realize people are talking about you ('Ugh, that stomach-drop moment is the worst')",
      "Add one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to soften the clinical tone of 'might have been uncomfortable'",
      "Consolidate the two questions into one natural follow-up ('Do you want to tell me what you heard, or are you looking for ways to handle it?') to avoid feeling like an interrogation"
