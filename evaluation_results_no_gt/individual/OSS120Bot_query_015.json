    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text conversation",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I get how frustrating it is', 'I'd say something like') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use with their sibling ('Hey, I've noticed you've been going through my stuff...') rather than vague 'just talk to them' advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly mismatched with the intensity of the situation (privacy invasion/frustration) where 😤, 😠, or 💙 might convey solidarity better",
      "Could more directly acknowledge the 'about to lose it' intensity the user mentioned, validating the anger/being at wit's end rather than just calling it 'annoying'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining clear organization through paragraph breaks",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with natural transitions between validation, advice, and engagement. Uses dashes for emphasis within sentences rather than list formatting."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider matching emoji choice more closely to the emotional intensity - for privacy violations and frustration, a 💙 or 😤 might land better than 😅 which implies awkwardness/nervousness",
      "Could amplify validation of the anger by specifically naming the 'about to lose it' feeling ('That rage when someone violates your space is totally valid') before moving to solutions"
