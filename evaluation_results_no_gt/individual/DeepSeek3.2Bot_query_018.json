    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I think that's totally normal', 'I'd probably try') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation that acknowledges the specific weight of the situation ('heavy, awful feeling when the house doesn't feel safe')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could be slightly more comprehensive - while headphones are a good immediate suggestion, missing guidance on when/how to talk to parents later or seek outside support",
      "The transition from validation to advice ('Honestly, I'd probably try...') could include one more validating sentence before offering solutions to perfect the balance"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose format with consistent first-person language that makes it feel like a supportive friend texting rather than a bot",

      "Consider adding one sentence validating that it's not their fault or responsibility to fix their parents' conflict",
      "Include a gentle suggestion about reaching out to a school counselor or trusted adult if the fighting is frequent or intense, to balance the immediate coping advice with longer-term support options"
