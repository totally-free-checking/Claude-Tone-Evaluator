    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message rather than a structured guide",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, are you okay? You seem a little quieter than usual...' which is exactly the kind of concrete help teens need"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - the response ends with a statement and emoji rather than engaging the user to continue the conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal phrasing like 'Maybe try' and 'That gives them space' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could' which creates distance rather than connection"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with specific actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen can use when texting their friend",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with two natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end like 'Have you noticed them acting different in person too, or is it just over text?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout to sound more like a supportive friend - change 'Maybe try reaching out' to 'I'd probably just send something like...' and 'That gives them space' to 'I think that gives them space'",
      "Consider opening with slightly more personal validation like 'Ugh, I know that feeling' or 'I get how that uncertainty can eat at you' to establish the 'I've been there' connection sooner"
