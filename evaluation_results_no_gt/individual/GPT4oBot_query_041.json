    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the WORST feeling!' and 'Totally not dramatic' which directly addresses the user's concern about being dramatic",
      "Excellent use of first-person language creating connection: 'I've totally been there,' 'I promise,' and 'Honestly, you're not alone'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with three flowing paragraphs",
      "Specific, realistic advice for a teen's immediate situation (asking friends, vending machines, cafeteria) rather than generic platitudes",
      "Engaging, situation-specific follow-up question: 'Did you already realize you forgot it, or did it only hit when lunch period started?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No emoji used when one could enhance the warm, casual tone (though the exclamation marks do convey energy)",
      "Advice could include specific phrasing suggestions for how to ask friends for food, which would make it even more actionable",
      "Slightly repetitive validation in the second paragraph ('it always feels so much bigger in the moment than it really is') which somewhat restates the first paragraph's sentiment"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - the response uses zero bullet points, headers, or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting in conversational paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while acceptable to have none for this casual situation, it's the only dimension where the response doesn't fully optimize for warmth (a single 😅 or 💙 could enhance the opening without being excessive)",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or numbered items. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the beginning to enhance the casual, friendly tone without overdoing it",
      "Include specific script suggestions for asking friends, such as 'Hey, could I grab a few of your chips? I'll pay you back tomorrow' to make the advice even more actionable",
      "The validation is strong but slightly repetitive between paragraphs 1 and 2 - could tighten by varying the emotional acknowledgment slightly"
