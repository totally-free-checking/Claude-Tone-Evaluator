    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I totally get', 'I think' implied in tone) creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh' and physical description ('stomach twist') that validates the embarrassment without dismissing it",
      "Specific, realistic advice tailored to teen agency (chatting beforehand, hallway practice, talking to teacher) rather than generic platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transition to the follow-up question is slightly abrupt without a soft bridge phrase",
      "Could benefit from one additional validating phrase after the advice to bookend the emotional support before asking the question"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational flow—completely avoids bullet points and structured advice, instead weaving suggestions naturally into paragraph form like a real conversation",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or numbered lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief transitional phrase before the final question (like 'Anyway, enough advice—') to make the shift feel more conversational",
      "Continue using the first-person language ('I'd say', 'I think') as it creates strong connection and distinguishes this from generic AI responses",
      "The single emoji placement is ideal—consider keeping this 0-1 emoji pattern for future responses"
