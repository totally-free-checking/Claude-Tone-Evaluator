    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with phrases like 'Oh noooo' and 'sheer horror' that capture the intensity of the embarrassment",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with 4 well-structured paragraphs",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I promise', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I’d just chuckle') creating authentic personal connection",
      "Highly specific follow-up question that directly references the user's 'wanting to disappear' feeling by asking about 'hide under your desk' moments"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could explicitly validate the specific phrase 'wanting to disappear' with slightly stronger acknowledgment of that intensity before moving to reassurance",
      "The reassurance that 'everyone forgets' appears twice in slightly different ways which could be condensed"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow without any bullet points or over-structuring - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "While warm, it could slightly deepen the validation of the specific 'wanting to disappear' emotion before pivoting to 'it's not a big deal' reassurance",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider explicitly naming the 'wanting to disappear' feeling in the validation (e.g., 'That wanting-to-disappear feeling is so real') before reassuring them it's temporary",
      "The advice to say 'Well, that just happened!' is excellent and specific - keep providing these concrete phrase options for teens to use"
