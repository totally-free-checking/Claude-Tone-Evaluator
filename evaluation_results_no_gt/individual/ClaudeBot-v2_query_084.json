    "strengths": [
      "Exceptional emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and vivid description of the 'stuck, powerless feeling' that specifically names the teen's experience of not being heard",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I'd wait,' 'I get why you're upset,' 'I'm so sorry') creates authentic peer-like connection rather than distant advisor tone"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While the absence of emojis is appropriate for the serious topic, a single supportive emoji (like 💙) at the end of the first paragraph could enhance warmth without undermining the gravity of the situation",
      "The negotiation script assumes parents are open to dialogue, which may not apply to all family dynamics, though the alternative suggestion ('asking for a clear end date') helps mitigate this"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows conversationally through three well-structured paragraphs that read like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while appropriately minimal (zero) for this serious topic, it is the only dimension where the response doesn't actively utilize the tool to enhance connection, even though the choice is justified",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice is seamlessly woven into conversational paragraphs using natural transitions like 'If you can, I'd wait...' and 'Something like...'"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) after 'it sucks' in the first paragraph to add visual warmth without trivializing the frustration",
      "The specific script provided ('I get why you're upset...') is excellent - maintain this level of concrete phrasing in future responses"
