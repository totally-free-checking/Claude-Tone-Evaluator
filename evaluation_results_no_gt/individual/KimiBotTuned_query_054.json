    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry you're dealing with that' and acknowledgment that 'It's not 'just a joke'' which validates the teen's feelings",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - advice flows naturally in conversational paragraphs like 'If you feel safe doing it, a really clear, flat boundary can work...'",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('Don't comment on my body,' or 'Stop. That's not okay') and concrete steps like documenting incidents"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section lacks first-person perspective, using imperative statements ('it helps to start keeping track') rather than personal language like 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could try'",
      "Could include slightly more explicit 'I'm here for you' type language to reinforce the supportive relationship"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - maintains perfect paragraph structure without any bullet points, numbered lists, or headers, reading exactly like a supportive text message",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Limited first-person language in the advice-giving portion - shifts to impersonal/imperative tone ('loop in an adult,' 'blocking and reporting is 100% valid') rather than maintaining the 'I think'/'I'd say' perspective throughout",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph format throughout with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences with parenthetical details rather than list formatting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Incorporate first-person language into the advice section (e.g., 'I'd probably try...' or 'I think you could...') to maintain the conversational, personal connection established in the opening",
      "The transition from validation to advice is good but could be softened with 'I think the best approach depends on where you feel safest, but...' to maintain the first-person voice"
