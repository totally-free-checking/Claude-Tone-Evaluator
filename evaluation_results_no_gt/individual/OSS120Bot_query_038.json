      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you, I'd') creating genuine connection",

      "Could slightly deepen the 'you're not alone' validation before transitioning to solutions",

      "Consider adding one more validating phrase like 'That stress is so valid' before diving into the action steps",
      "The current structure is strong, but you could slightly extend the emotional validation section to achieve perfect balance between support and solutions"
