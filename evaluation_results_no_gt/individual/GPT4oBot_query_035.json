      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry, that hurts' and 'punch to the gut' language that mirrors teen emotional experience",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I totally get,' 'If I were you, I'd,' 'I promise') creating authentic connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice could include specific script suggestions for how to open up to someone when 'acting fine' becomes exhausting",

      "Consider adding one specific phrase or script the teen could use when talking to a friend or parent about the disappointment (e.g., 'Hey, I'm actually really bummed about the team thing')",
      "The emoji usage is appropriate but could experiment with a slightly more supportive one like 💙 or 🤗 to balance the sadness of 😞 while maintaining warmth"
