      "Provides specific, actionable advice with concrete scripts the teen can use (e.g., 'I’ve been feeling like sometimes I’m only included because of [person]...')",
      "Ends with relevant, specific questions that show interest in the details of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and numbered lists (4 bullets for signs, 5 numbered steps) instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' to create personal connection",
      "Jumps quickly to solutions after only one sentence of validation, creating an imbalanced advice-heavy tone"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, specific steps including exact phrases to use in conversation",

      "notes": "Response uses 4 bullet points for 'signs,' 5 numbered items for advice with bold headers, and sub-bullets. Reads like a wikiHow article or self-help guide rather than a text conversation. Heavy formatting with **bold text** throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite entirely as 2-3 flowing paragraphs without any bullet points or numbered lists - let advice emerge naturally in sentences rather than listing steps",
      "Add first-person connection language like 'I think I'd feel the same way' or 'I'm sorry you're dealing with this' to sound like a supportive friend rather than an advice column",
      "Move the 'signs' section into conversational prose (e.g., 'If you're noticing they only text when that person is around...') and integrate the advice into a narrative flow rather than steps"
