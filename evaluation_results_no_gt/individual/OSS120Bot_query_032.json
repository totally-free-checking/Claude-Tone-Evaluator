    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with physical empathy ('I get how that knot in your chest can keep looping') that makes the teen feel truly understood",
      "Strong first-person natural language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try,' 'I get how') creating authentic conversational flow",
      "Specific actionable script provided ('Hey, I've noticed things feel a bit off lately—everything okay?') with realistic timing advice (give them a day or two)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition to 'The good news is...' comes slightly quickly after validation, potentially minimizing the emotional weight just a touch before fully sitting with it",
      "The phrase 'this kind of vibe' is slightly generic compared to the otherwise specific emotional language used elsewhere"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs, no headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider extending the validation phase slightly longer before moving to 'good news' to fully acknowledge the anxiety of uncertainty",
      "The current emoji choice (😅) works well for the awkwardness, but ensure it doesn't unintentionally minimize the stress—consider 😊 or no emoji for heavier situations, though here it's appropriate"
