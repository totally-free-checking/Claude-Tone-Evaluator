      "Exceptional immediate emotional validation with vivid, relatable language ('That moment when everything just piles up and your brain basically goes \"nope!\" is seriously exhausting')",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'I know it sounds cheesy') creating authentic connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is slightly compound (asking what kind of assignments plus making a statement about talking it out), though it remains natural",
