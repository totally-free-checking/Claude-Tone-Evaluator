      "Practical advice is specific and actionable with realistic options like trying a food truck, splitting with a friend, or the 'snack drawer hunt'",
      "Maintains a casual, non-judgmental tone that normalizes the situation ('it happens to the best of us', 'honorary member')",
      "Appropriate length that is readable on mobile without being overwhelming"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points instead of natural prose paragraphs ('Want to pivot? You could:' followed by three bullet items)",
      "Complete absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') makes the response feel impersonal rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Fails to end with a follow-up question to continue the conversation; closes with a statement instead"

      "notes": "Response uses 'Want to pivot? You could:' as a header followed by three distinct bullet points, then switches back to prose for the final two sentences. This creates a listicle format rather than natural conversation flow."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose: 'If you want to pivot, you could turn it into a chance to try that food truck you've been eyeing, or see if a friend wants to split something nearby. Or honestly, I'd just embrace the snack drawer hunt...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection: 'I think we've all been there,' 'I'd probably go for a walk and clear my head first,' or 'I'm getting hungry just thinking about this!'",
      "End with a natural question to keep the conversation going: 'What's your usual move when this happens?' or 'Do you have a go-to spot nearby if you decide to grab something?'"
