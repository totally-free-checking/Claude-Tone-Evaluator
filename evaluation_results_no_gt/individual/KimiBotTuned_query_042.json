    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' and 'of course you're mad' that normalizes their anger",
      "Specific, actionable scripts for difficult conversations including exact phrases like 'Hey, I'm upset because when I got it back it was ruined' and 'I'm not trying to fight, I just need you to make it right'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') specified in the ideal character; relies entirely on second-person instructions ('you can', 'you're') creating slight distance",
      "Missing a closing offer of support like 'I'm here if you need to talk' that would strengthen the personal connection"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with specific conversational scripts for handling the confrontation - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person perspective and connection; the response advises using 'I' statements ('I'm not trying to fight') but the bot itself doesn't model this by sharing 'I think' or 'I'd feel' perspectives",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create personal connection, such as 'I get why you're mad' or 'I'd probably feel disrespected too' instead of only using 'you' statements",
      "Include a brief closing offer of ongoing support like 'I'm here if you need to talk through how it goes' to reinforce the supportive relationship"
