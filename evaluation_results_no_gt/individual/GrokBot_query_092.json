      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I've been there', 'I'd say') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the conversation ('Hey, I've noticed you've been hanging with these new people...') making advice immediately usable",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The heart emoji (💙), while warm, could feel slightly generic compared to more situation-specific emotional cues",
      "Could slightly deepen validation by explicitly naming the specific fear of losing the friend before moving to reassurance"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting rather than an AI generating advice",

      "Continue providing specific scripts/dialogue examples as they give teens concrete words to use in difficult conversations",
      "Consider adding one more 'I' statement of solidarity (like 'I get how scary that feels') before transitioning to the reassurance phase to maximize emotional validation"
