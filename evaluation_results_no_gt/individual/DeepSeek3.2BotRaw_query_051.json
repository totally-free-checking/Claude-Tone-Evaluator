    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation using casual language ('Yeah, that feeling really stings, doesn't it?') that immediately acknowledges the hurt",
      "Uses first-person language naturally ('I think a lot of people have felt that backup feeling') creating some personal connection",
      "Provides a specific, usable script for the teen ('Hey, I've been feeling a bit disconnected lately...') which gives concrete words to use in a difficult conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and numbered lists (4 bullets + 3 numbered sections with bold headers) instead of flowing conversational prose",
      "Ends with a concluding statement rather than a follow-up question, missing the opportunity to continue the dialogue",
      "Uses overly clinical/therapeutic language ('mutual care and chosen presence', 're-calibrate your energy', 'grieve the friendship') that feels more like a therapist than a supportive friend"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The specific conversation script provided in option 2, which gives exact words the teen can use rather than vague advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting structure with bullet points and bold-numbered headers that reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",

      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response contains 4 bullet points listing friendship patterns and 3 numbered items with bold headers for advice sections. The heavy structuring disrupts conversational flow and feels instructional rather than supportive."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points about friendship patterns and the numbered advice sections into natural flowing paragraphs - instead of listing 'Last-minute invites only,' weave it into sentences like 'You might notice you're only getting texts at the last minute when their other plans fall through'",
      "End with an engaging question to continue the conversation, such as 'Do you think this friendship is worth having a conversation about, or has this been going on too long?' or 'What pattern have you noticed most that makes you feel like the backup?'",
      "Replace clinical phrases like 're-calibrate your energy' and 'mutual care and chosen presence' with casual alternatives like 'maybe pull back a bit' and 'friendship should be about both people actually wanting to hang out'"
