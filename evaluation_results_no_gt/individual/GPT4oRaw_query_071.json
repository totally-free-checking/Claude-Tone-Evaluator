    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong use of first-person language ('I'm really sorry', 'I'm here to help') creating personal connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('under a lot of pressure', 'you're not alone') before problem-solving"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks concrete practical advice in this initial response - only offers to figure out steps later without giving one immediate actionable tip",
      "Could use more specific teen-relatable emotional language ('that sinking feeling', 'ugh, that stress') rather than somewhat generic 'Aw'",
      "Asks two questions in succession which slightly risks feeling like an interrogation, though they are related"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with no bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with two natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one small, concrete suggestion they could try immediately (like 'Maybe try breaking down the next assignment into tiny chunks?') while still asking follow-up questions",
      "Replace 'Aw' with something more emotionally specific like 'Ugh, that panic feeling is the worst' or 'Oh no, that stress is so real' to increase relatability",
      "Consider combining the two questions into one flowing question like 'Is it the coursework that's overwhelming you, or more like test anxiety?' to avoid the slight interrogation feel"
