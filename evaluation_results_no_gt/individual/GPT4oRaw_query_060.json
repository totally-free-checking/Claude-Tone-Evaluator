      "Opens with strong validation: 'Oh no, that sounds really tough and awkward—I'm sorry you're dealing with that!' immediately acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question 'How's your friend handling it?' that shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
      "Uses pure prose format with natural paragraph flow, reading like a text conversation rather than a structured guide"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal 'you could' statements instead of sharing perspective as a supportive friend",
      "Missing emoji that could enhance warmth for this awkward social situation (e.g., 😕 or 😅)",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective throughout: change 'you could ask them' to 'I'd probably ask them' or 'I think you could ask them' to sound like a supportive friend rather than a guide",
      "Include one warm emoji early in the response (like 😕 or 😅) to soften the tone and signal emotional safety",
      "Deepen the validation with 'I get it' language such as 'I get how awkward that feels when you're just trying to hang out' before moving to advice"
