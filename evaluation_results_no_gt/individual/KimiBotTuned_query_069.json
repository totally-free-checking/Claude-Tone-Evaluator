      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Contains a distracting typo/encoding error ('конкретely' instead of 'concretely') that breaks immersion",
      "Advice section could use more first-person framing ('I think...'/'I'd suggest...') rather than impersonal phrasing ('A decent way to tell is...')",
