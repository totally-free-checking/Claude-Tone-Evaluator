    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely over-structured with 6 numbered bullet points and bold headers instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Missing first-person language entirely - uses impersonal 'you should' instead of 'I think' or 'I'd suggest'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 natural paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of '1. Listen without judgment,' try 'Honestly, just listening without trying to fix everything is huge. I'd say let them vent if they want to...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout - use 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'In my experience' to create a personal connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "End with a specific, engaging question like 'What did your friend tell you they're struggling with?' or 'How are you feeling about all this?' to invite continued conversation",
      "Start with deeper validation of the user's own emotions - acknowledge that feeling helpless when a friend is struggling is scary and heavy before jumping to solutions"
