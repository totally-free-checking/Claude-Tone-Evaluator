    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual interjection ('Ugh, that's so exhausting') and vivid metaphor ('like you can't breathe') to acknowledge the trapped feeling",
      "Uses natural first-person advisory language throughout ('If I were you, I'd send...', 'I'm gonna be slower to reply') creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script language teens can actually use ('Hey, I'm not always able to text back a lot...') rather than vague suggestions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while conveying exhaustion, might slightly understate the seriousness if the situation involves potential harassment",
      "Could include one additional validating sentence between the emotional acknowledgment and the 'If I were you' advice to create even smoother transition",
      "The escalation advice ('loop in a trusted adult') comes somewhat abruptly at the end of a long sentence; could be separated for emphasis"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text message from a friend",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😊 or 💙 instead of 😅 for serious boundary issues to match the emotional weight while keeping warmth",
      "Add a brief transitional validation phrase like 'I know it's hard to actually send that text, but...' between the validation and advice sections",
      "Break the final advice sentence into two shorter ones to emphasize the adult/school staff escalation option as a distinct, important step"
