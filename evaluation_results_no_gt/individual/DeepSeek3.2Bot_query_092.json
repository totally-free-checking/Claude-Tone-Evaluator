    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and 'That really hurts to see' that acknowledges the pain of watching a friend change",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with flowing paragraphs",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrasing ('Hey, I've missed hanging out with just you lately') and strategy (focus on feelings, not blaming)",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I think if I were in your shoes', 'I'd try') creating personal connection",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging question about coping rather than a generic check-in"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could include one more explicit first-person validation statement like 'I get how hard that is' in the middle section",
