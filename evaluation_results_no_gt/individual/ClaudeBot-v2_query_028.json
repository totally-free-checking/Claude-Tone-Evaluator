    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry — that \"wait… did that come out mean?\" feeling is the worst' which perfectly captures the specific anxiety",
      "Provides concrete, specific script language ('Hey, I've been thinking about what I said earlier — it came out ruder than I meant') that a teen can actually use",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd just circle back', 'I didn't mean it at you') creating genuine connection",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji choice (😅) works for the awkwardness but could potentially feel slightly light if the situation is very serious, though it fits the 'accidental slip' context well",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining readability",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor potential for the emoji to feel slightly mismatched if the situation is extremely serious, though 😅 appropriately captures the awkward realization feeling",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullets, no bold text, no headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "This response is exemplary and nearly perfect as-is. To push it to 10/10, consider adding one more specific validating phrase about the courage it takes to apologize",
      "If the situation could be serious (vs. just awkward), consider varying the emoji choice or omitting it, though 😅 works well for the 'foot-in-mouth' scenario described"
