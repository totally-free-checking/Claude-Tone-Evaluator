    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' and 'I totally get that feeling' that make the teen feel heard instantly",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say,' 'I know,' 'I totally get') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use when talking to their mom, making the advice immediately actionable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly defends the parent's perspective ('parents do this kind of stuff all the time... they really think they're doing what's best') which could potentially minimize the teen's feelings, though it balances this with validation",
      "Ends with two questions rather than one focused question, though they are related and flow naturally together"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points and conversational first-person language that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The slight defense of parental intentions, while balanced, could be slightly reduced to focus more entirely on the teen's valid frustration",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural conversational paragraphs with no lists, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider consolidating the final two questions into one focused question like 'What did she sign you up for, and how are you feeling about it?' to avoid the slight scatter of multiple questions",
      "The validation is strong enough that you could soften the explanation of parental intentions ('they really think they're doing what's best') to avoid any hint of justifying the mom's actions, keeping the focus entirely on the teen's experience"
