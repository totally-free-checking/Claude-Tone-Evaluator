    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and first-person empathy: 'I totally get how frustrating that can be' sets a warm, understanding tone immediately",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (5-minute meditation, 10-minute walks, OTC pain relievers) rather than vague platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and headers ('Quick relief:', 'Longer-term stress management:', 'When to see someone:') makes it read like a wiki article rather than a conversation",
      "Advice sections lack first-person language - uses impersonal directives ('Try some deep breathing', 'Put a cold compress') instead of 'I'd suggest...' or 'What helps me is...'",
      "Asks two questions at once ('What kind of stress... And have you noticed...') which can feel overwhelming rather than inviting a natural back-and-forth"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, teen-appropriate suggestions with specific timeframes (5-minute meditation, 10-minute walk) and realistic medical guidance",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Formatting structure - uses three header sections with 8+ bullet points, creating a checklist feel rather than natural prose flow",

      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold headers ('Quick relief:', 'Longer-term stress management:', 'When to see someone:') followed by bullet lists. Only the opening sentence and final paragraph are prose. This is heavily structured and reads as informational rather than conversational."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the advice sections as natural paragraphs using first-person suggestions: instead of 'Try some deep breathing,' write 'I'd suggest starting with some deep breathing - even just a few minutes can help release that tension.'",
      "Remove all headers and bullet points. Flow the advice naturally: 'For quick relief, I'd try putting a cold compress on your forehead or a warm one on your neck. Gently massaging your temples helps too, and make sure you're drinking enough water.'",
      "Choose one follow-up question instead of two. Either ask about the type of stress OR about triggers, not both simultaneously, to keep the conversation feeling manageable and focused."
