    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'Honestly, I think', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I'd be honest') creating genuine connection",
      "Strong emotional validation with specific physical description of guilt ('sits heavy in your chest') and immediate empathy ('it's so hard')",
      "Provides concrete, actionable script for the difficult conversation: 'I've really valued my time here, but I need to step back to focus on other things right now'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is technically two questions joined together ('What's the activity, and what's making you want to move on from it?') which slightly breaks the 'one natural question' ideal",
      "Could potentially extend validation one more sentence before moving to advice, though the balance is still quite good"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and consistent first-person perspective throughout, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question combines two queries into one sentence, which is slightly less focused than a single, specific question",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Uses natural paragraph flow with italic emphasis on 'why' for emphasis only, not formatting. Reads like a continuous conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider making the final question singular and even more specific, such as 'What part of the activity feels heaviest right now?' rather than the double question",
      "The validation is strong but could briefly acknowledge the specific guilt about letting others down (common in teen activity quitting) before moving to the 'people stay too long' observation"
