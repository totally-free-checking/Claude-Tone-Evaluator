    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with personal empathy: 'my stomach does a little flip when I see something like that, too' creates instant connection and normalizes their fear",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally from validation to reassurance to advice like a real conversation",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout: 'If I were you, I'd take,' 'I'm so sorry,' and 'my stomach' makes it feel like a supportive friend rather than a bot"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for nervous anticipation, slightly understates the 'terrified' intensity the user expressed - a 💙 or no emoji might have matched the emotional weight better",
      "Could acknowledge the specific word 'terrified' more directly to fully match the intensity of their fear before moving to reassurance"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose flow without any formatting structures - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice in paragraphs",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider matching the emotional intensity more precisely - if they say 'terrified,' acknowledge that specific weight before the 'usually less dramatic' reassurance",
      "The response is exemplary overall; maintain this exact balance of personal first-person sharing, specific script suggestions, and open-ended follow-up questions"
