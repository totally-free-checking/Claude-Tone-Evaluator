      "Provides extremely specific and actionable advice with concrete steps (delete/edit/check reposts/specific apology wording)",
      "Asks relevant, situation-specific follow-up questions about platform type and nature of the regret"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses heavy formatting with headers, numbered lists, and bullet points instead of natural conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') and emotional warmth, reading more like a safety manual than a supportive friend",
      "Jumps immediately to solutions after minimal validation ('Totally understandable' followed instantly by 'here are the steps')"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the specific actions (checking screenshots, reporting personal info, sample apology text) are realistic and immediately useful for a teen",

      "notes": "Response uses markdown headers (## Do this first), numbered lists (1, 2, 3, 4), bullet points (-), and bold text (**Delete it**) throughout. Only 2-3 sentences are actual prose; the rest is heavily structured formatting."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite the entire response as 2-3 natural paragraphs instead of bullet lists - flow the advice into sentences like 'If I were you, I'd start by deleting it if you can, then check if anyone screenshotted it...'",
      "Add emotional validation using first-person language upfront, such as 'Ugh, I know that sinking feeling so well - we've all been there!' before giving any advice",
      "Change imperative commands ('Do this first', 'Decide the best follow-up') to personal suggestions ('I think the best first move is...', 'I'd suggest figuring out...')",
      "Reduce the three follow-up questions to one natural question like 'What platform was it on, and can you still delete it?'"
