    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, realistic scripts a teen could actually use (e.g., 'I've gotta be honest, I get a weird vibe from [name]...')",
      "Strong follow-up question that feels natural and invites specific details about the severity of the situation",
      "Good emotional validation in the opening paragraph acknowledging the 'stuck' feeling between speaking up and staying quiet"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily structured format with 5 bold headers and bullet-like sections instead of natural flowing prose ('Check in with yourself first', 'Be honest, but don't stage an intervention')",
      "Lacks first-person conversational language throughout the advice sections - reads like an instructional article rather than a friend sharing thoughts (missing 'I think', 'I'd say', 'In my experience')",
      "Transitions immediately from brief validation to 'Here are a few ways...' which feels like a self-help guide rather than a supportive conversation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The practical advice quality and specific follow-up question demonstrate strong understanding of teen agency and realistic friendship dynamics",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The formatting is overly structured with bold headers and list-like sections, violating the natural prose requirement that makes it feel like texting with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response uses 5 bold headers acting as section dividers with structured subsections. While written in sentences, the format resembles a wikiHow article or guide rather than conversational texting. The phrase 'Here are a few ways to navigate it' explicitly signals a list format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the structured advice sections into 2-3 flowing paragraphs using first-person perspective like 'I think the most important thing is...' or 'I'd probably start by checking in with yourself...' instead of imperative headers",
      "Add more 'I' statements and personal-feeling language throughout the advice portion to maintain the conversational tone established in the first paragraph",
      "Integrate emotional validation throughout the response rather than front-loading it - acknowledge feelings between advice points with phrases like 'I know that's scary to think about' or 'That part really sucks'"
