      "Excellent immediate validation with first-person empathy: 'I've totally been there, and it's okay to not like someone back like that' creates instant connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with 4 well-sized paragraphs",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly deepen validation by explicitly naming the fear of hurting the other person's feelings before jumping to 'most people bounce back'",
