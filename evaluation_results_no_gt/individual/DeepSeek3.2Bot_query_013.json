    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'If I were you, I'd try', 'I promise') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting—reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh man, that's the worst feeling!') before offering any advice",
      "Specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (holding a clicker/note card, palm pressing against desk) rather than generic 'just relax' platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could include one more sentence acknowledging how uncomfortable the physical symptoms feel before jumping to solutions",
      "Could potentially include slightly more validation about the fear of judgment specifically, though the 'nobody knows your material better' line is reassuring"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting—maintains perfect conversational paragraph structure throughout",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one more sentence of validation specifically about the physical sensation of shaking before moving to the 'If I were you' advice section",
      "The response is strong overall; maintain this exact level of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') in future responses as it creates authentic connection"
