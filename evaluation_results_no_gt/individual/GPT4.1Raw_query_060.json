    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, reading like a text message",
      "Uses first-person language appropriately with 'I'm sorry' and 'I can help' creating personal connection",
      "Validates feelings explicitly with phrases like 'your feelings are totally valid' and acknowledges the difficulty of the situation",
      "Appropriate length for mobile reading—substantial but not overwhelming"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks a specific follow-up question at the end; closes with an imperative statement ('let me know') rather than an engaging question to continue conversation",
      "Practical advice is vague and non-committal—offers to 'brainstorm' later rather than providing one concrete actionable tip now",
      "Missing casual first-person connective phrases like 'I get it,' 'I'd say,' or 'I think' that would make it feel more like a personal conversation",
      "Opening validation ('That sounds tough') is somewhat generic and could be warmer/more specific to the awkwardness of parental disapproval"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, maintaining conversational flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up engagement—fails to end with a specific question that invites the teen to share more details about what happened",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace the closing statement with a specific question like 'Do you know what specifically made them feel that way?' or 'What happened that made you think they don't like you?'",
      "Add one concrete, actionable tip before asking for more details—such as suggesting a specific way to show their true self or handle the next interaction",
      "Enhance warmth by using more casual, relatable openings like 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable situation' or 'I get how awkward that feels'",
      "Consider adding one supportive emoji (like 😕 or 😅) early in the response to enhance the warm, casual tone"
