      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I've been there,' 'If I were you,' 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I love hanging with you, but it feels like everything's a competition lately'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullets or headers - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) to enhance the casual tone, though the absence isn't problematic for this slightly serious topic",
      "The advice paragraph is slightly dense; could break into two smaller paragraphs for better mobile readability"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - maintains conversational flow throughout while delivering practical advice embedded in sentences",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 after 'exhausting' or 💙 at the end) to enhance the supportive tone, though this is optional",
      "The paragraph containing advice could be split after 'scorekeeping?' to create more white space for mobile readability, but the content itself is excellent"
