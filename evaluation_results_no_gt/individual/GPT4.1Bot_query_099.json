    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific language acknowledging the violation ('gut-punch,' 'privacy was totally ripped away,' 'mix of anger, embarrassment')",
      "Excellent use of first-person advice framing ('If I were you, I'd probably need a minute to cool off') that makes the guidance feel personal and relatable",
      "Perfect follow-up question that offers two specific, natural paths forward (wanting to talk vs. needing to vent) rather than generic engagement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could strengthen first-person connection slightly in the normalization paragraph by adding an 'I' statement like 'I've seen friends go through this' or 'I get why you'd feel violated'",
      "The transition between validation and advice could include one more explicit 'I'm here for you' or 'I hear you' type statement to bridge the emotional and practical sections"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, creating a seamless conversational flow that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slightly limited first-person language in the middle paragraph where it shifts to normalization - uses 'so many people' instead of 'I've seen' or 'I know' which creates minor distance",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one explicit first-person validation statement like 'I'd feel exactly the same way' or 'I get why you feel violated' to strengthen the personal connection in the middle section",
      "Consider varying the opening validation slightly to include 'I'm so sorry that happened to you' alongside the 'gut-punch' language for maximum warmth",
      "The advice about digital notes is excellent and age-appropriate; maintain this level of specific, actionable guidance that acknowledges teen limitations (like needing to hide things rather than just 'setting boundaries')"
