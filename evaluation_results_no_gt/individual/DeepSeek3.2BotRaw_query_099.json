    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation that acknowledges the violation of trust and emotional impact ('completely understandable that you feel violated', 'exposed and disrespected')",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including a realistic script the teen could actually use when talking to their parent ('When you read my private notes, it made me feel like my thoughts aren't safe...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses heavy bullet-point formatting with bold headers instead of natural conversational prose, making it feel like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes the response feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Ends with a statement rather than a follow-up question to continue the conversation, missing the opportunity to engage further"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides concrete, realistic steps including specific phrasing for confronting the parent",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - relies on a numbered list with bold formatting instead of flowing conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Uses 'It might help to:' introduction followed by three numbered bullet points with bold headers (Take a moment to breathe, Consider talking to them calmly, Find a new way to keep your thoughts private). This heavy structuring disrupts the conversational flow that should characterize a teen support chat."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of '1. Take a moment to breathe,' write something like 'First, I'd just give yourself permission to feel whatever you're feeling right now...'",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - use phrases like 'I think the best approach would be...' or 'I'd suggest trying...' instead of impersonal directives",
      "End with a specific, engaging follow-up question like 'Do you think you'll try talking to them about it, or do you feel like you need some space first?' to invite continued conversation"
