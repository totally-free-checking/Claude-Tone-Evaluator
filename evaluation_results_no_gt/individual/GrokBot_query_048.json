    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that really sucks') and acknowledges the specific pain of questioning yourself",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I'd try', 'I totally get', 'I promise') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script for talking to parents ('Hey, when you compare me to [sibling]...') rather than vague 'just communicate' advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The phrase 'you're your own person with your own awesome qualities' borders on generic platitude, though it's saved by the surrounding context",
      "Could potentially be slightly more concise in the middle paragraph where it explains parental perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text message from a friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The reassurance about parental perspective ('it often says more about how your parents see things') is helpful but slightly distances from the immediate emotional validation",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain the excellent use of first-person language ('I'd say', 'I think') which makes it feel like a real person talking",
      "The specific conversation script provided is exactly the kind of actionable help teens need - keep providing these concrete phrases",
      "The follow-up question about what specifically is being compared (grades vs personality) is perfect - it shows genuine interest and invites continuation"
