      "Immediate validation with 'Oh nooo, that's such a specific flavor of awkward!' perfectly captures the specific emotional experience of social embarrassment",

      "Uses 2 emojis (😅 and 🙃) which slightly exceeds the ideal 0-1 maximum for sparse, natural usage",

      "Consider adding explicit first-person supportive language like 'I'm here if you want to talk more' or 'I totally get that feeling' to strengthen the personal connection"
