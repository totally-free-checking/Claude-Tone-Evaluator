    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose format with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with smooth paragraph transitions",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'That feeling can be really heavy' and acknowledging how 'draining' the situation is",
      "Natural follow-up questions that show genuine interest in the specific situation rather than generic check-ins"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks practical advice or actionable coping strategies - focuses entirely on validation without offering any 'here's what you can try' content",
      "Missing first-person sharing language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - feels slightly observational rather than personally connected",
      "Uses slightly adult-centric examples ('at work') and therapy-speak ('inner critic') that may not fully resonate with teen experience"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero bullet points - perfectly matches the ideal character's paragraph-based approach",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of practical advice or solutions - the response validates feelings but offers no concrete strategies for coping with the 'not enough' feeling",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice about pressure sources flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one small piece of practical advice or a concrete coping strategy, such as suggesting they write down three small wins or try self-compassion phrases",
      "Incorporate more first-person connection language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to make it feel more like a personal conversation rather than an observation",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 💙 or 😔) early in the response to enhance the supportive tone, though none is acceptable for this heavier topic"
