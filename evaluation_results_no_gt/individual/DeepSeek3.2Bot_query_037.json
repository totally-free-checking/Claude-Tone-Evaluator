    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's such a gut-punch moment. Your heart just drops, doesn't it?' which immediately acknowledges the emotional impact",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try,' 'I know that's way easier said than done') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation with natural paragraph flow"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Moves quickly from validation to reframing/minimizing with 'it feels way more dramatic and awful in the moment than it usually is,' which could feel dismissive of the teen's immediate hurt",
      "Could benefit from one more sentence of pure emotional support before jumping to practical advice and perspective-reframing",
      "The 😅 emoji choice, while only one, might not perfectly match the emotional weight of being talked about (suggests awkwardness/nervousness more than hurt)"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and zero bullet points - perfectly matches the texting-a-friend aesthetic",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Balance of support versus solutions - pivots too quickly from emotional validation to advice and reframing without fully sitting with the hurt feelings first",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or over-structuring. Uses natural paragraph breaks that flow from validation to advice to follow-up question."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add one more sentence of pure emotional validation before the reframing ('That really hurts' or 'You don't deserve that') to ensure the teen feels fully heard before moving to solutions",
      "Consider using 💙 or 😟 instead of 😅 for serious/hurtful situations, or omit the emoji entirely, as 😅 implies nervous laughter which may not match the gut-punch feeling described",
      "Expand the validation section slightly to acknowledge that overhearing gossip can feel isolating before jumping to 'people make passing comments all the time'"
