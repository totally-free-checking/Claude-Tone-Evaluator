    "strengths": [
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use like 'Can we talk about school? I need to be honest about something'",
      "Appropriate length that covers the topic without being overwhelming or too brief",
      "Uses contractions and casual openings like 'Aw, I'm sorry' to attempt warmth"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on structured bullet points with corporate-style headers like 'Take Ownership and Show Effort' and 'Be Open to Conversations'",
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - closes with 'You got this!' instead of engaging the user",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and instructional rather than conversational",
      "Quickly pivots from brief validation to solution mode with 'but it's important to be honest' which feels dismissive of the fear"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers realistic, specific steps and actual scripts a teen could use when talking to parents",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses 4 numbered bullets with bold headers creating a self-help article format rather than conversational texting style",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response uses 4 numbered bullet points with bold headers (e.g., '**Prepare What You Want to Say**'). The advice is delivered entirely through this structured format rather than flowing naturally in paragraphs. Only the opening and closing sentences are in prose form."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs that flow conversationally - instead of '1. Prepare what you want to say', write something like 'I'd probably think through how to explain it first. Maybe mention if it's a tough subject or a specific assignment that tripped you up'",
      "Add a genuine follow-up question at the end like 'What do you think is making you most nervous about telling them?' or 'Do you think they'll be more upset about the grade or that you waited to tell them?'",
      "Use first-person language throughout to create connection: 'I think the best approach is...', 'I'd suggest finding a calm moment...', 'I get why you're scared...'",
      "Spend more time validating the fear before jumping to solutions - acknowledge that sinking feeling and that grades can feel like the end of the world even when they're not",
      "Remove corporate-sounding headers like 'Take Ownership' which sounds like a school handbook rather than a supportive friend"
