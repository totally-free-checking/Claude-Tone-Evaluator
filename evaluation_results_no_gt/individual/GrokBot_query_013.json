    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, presenting with shaky hands is the worst' and relatable physical description ('your whole body feel like it's betraying you')",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points - advice flows organically in sentences like 'I'd try taking some deep breaths... If you're holding notes or a clicker...'",
      "Specific, actionable advice including the concrete 4-4-4 breathing technique and realistic physical strategies (gripping clicker, tucking hands)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question combines two distinct questions ('What's the topic... or have you practiced...'), which is slightly less focused than a single engaging question",
      "Could strengthen first-person connection with phrases like 'I think' or 'I find that' rather than 'The good news is there are...' in the transition to advice"

      "Consider using 'I think' or 'I'd say' when transitioning to advice to maintain first-person warmth throughout",
      "Separate the final question into a single focus or use an 'and' instead of 'or' to make it feel more like one continuous thought rather than two distinct questions"
