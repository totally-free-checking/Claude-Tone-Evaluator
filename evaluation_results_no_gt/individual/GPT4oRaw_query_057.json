    "strengths": [
      "Uses natural prose without any bullet points, headers, or over-formatting, creating a conversational text-like flow",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation: 'Oh no, that sounds frustrating! I'm sorry you're dealing with that'",
      "Uses first-person language naturally with 'I'm sorry' and 'we can think,' creating personal connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Response is too brief (only 2-3 sentences) and feels dismissive rather than providing substantial support",
      "Advice is vague and generic: 'talk to your teacher or explain your side' without specific guidance on what to say or how to approach them",
      "Question 'What happened?' is placed in the middle of the response rather than at the end, failing to effectively invite continued conversation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads like a text message",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Expand to 2-4 paragraphs to provide more substantial emotional validation about the unfairness and more detailed advice",
      "Move the question to the end of the response or add an additional engaging follow-up question to properly invite continued conversation",
      "Provide specific, actionable advice about approaching the teacher (e.g., 'You could ask to speak with them after class and say something like...')"
