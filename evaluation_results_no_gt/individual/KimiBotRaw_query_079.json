    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation using first-person language ('I totally get that') and normalizes the experience ('way more common than you think')",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice tailored to teen contexts (sandwich halves, pasta in thermos, library corners, timing strategies)",
      "Ends with an excellent, specific follow-up question that pinpoints the exact source of anxiety (chewing vs. mess vs. feeling 'on display')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bold headers and structured formatting ('**Start small**', '**Distraction helps**') creates a listicle feel rather than natural conversation",
      "Lacks first-person framing in the advice section - uses imperative commands ('Start small', 'Bring a book') instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'You could try'",
      "Could benefit from slightly deeper emotional acknowledgment before jumping into the solution list"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - offers concrete, realistic strategies specific to school environments and teen limitations",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Prose formatting - uses bold headers and bullet-like structure throughout instead of flowing conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses 5 bold headers acting as section dividers with em-dash explanations, creating a structured list format rather than natural prose flow. Only the opening and closing sentences are true paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bold headers into flowing prose by combining related ideas into paragraphs and using transitional phrases like 'I'd start by...' or 'Another thing that helps is...'",
      "Add first-person framing to advice sections (e.g., 'I'd suggest starting small...' instead of 'Start small') to maintain the conversational 'friend texting' feel",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) at the opening to enhance the casual, supportive tone"
