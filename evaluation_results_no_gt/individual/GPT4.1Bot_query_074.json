    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, such as 'If I were you, I'd probably pick a chill time' and 'I get why that would stress you out', creating a personal, supportive connection that feels like texting with an older sibling",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or bold text; advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that is so frustrating!' and reassuring language like 'you're not alone in this' that acknowledges the pain without dismissing it",
      "Natural teen-appropriate casual language ('crank things up', 'chill time', 'super casual') that avoids being cringe while maintaining authenticity"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "While zero emojis is acceptable for this topic, incorporating one subtle supportive emoji could enhance the warmth of the opening validation",
      "Practical advice section, while realistic, could offer one additional contingency plan for situations where the direct conversation approach doesn't work"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The conversational tone and first-person language that creates genuine connection, particularly the way it balances validation with specific actionable advice like the suggested script 'Hey, I noticed you've been way more strict lately. Is something wrong?'",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The absence of emojis, though not problematic for this specific topic, misses a potential opportunity to add visual warmth that could enhance the supportive tone (though text alone carries the warmth well)",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. The advice is integrated naturally into sentences ('If I were you, I'd probably pick a chill time...') rather than being structured as a list, perfectly matching the ideal character's texting-style prose format."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider maintaining this level of specific follow-up questioning in all responses—the questions about 'going out, your grades, or just, like, everything all at once' show genuine interest and invite continuation perfectly",
      "The balance of validation-to-advice ratio is excellent here; continue leading with emotional acknowledgment ('Ugh, that is so frustrating') before moving to practical solutions"
