    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'If I were you', 'I'd try') that creates genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation ('that smile just sent your brain into overdrive') that normalizes the experience without dismissing it"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The closing question is slightly compound (asking about 'next move' and 'whether to say anything' in one breath), which could feel like two questions",
      "Could slightly deepen the validation by explicitly naming the specific anxiety ('worrying if they like you back') before moving to advice"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation flow with consistent first-person perspective ('If I were you', 'I'd try') that avoids any robotic or instructional formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question combines two related queries into one sentence, which slightly dilutes the focus of the engagement",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider simplifying the closing question to one focused inquiry rather than the compound 'what do you think... or are you still trying to figure out' structure",
      "While the grounding technique advice is good, you could enhance it by briefly acknowledging the specific fear ('worrying if the smile meant something') before offering the solution"
