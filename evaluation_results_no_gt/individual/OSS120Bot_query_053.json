    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get how frustrating', 'I think' implied in advice) creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, if anything comes up last minute...' and 'everything cool on your end?') rather than vague suggestions",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that really sucks', 'left hanging') before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The normalization 'most people end up doing that at least once' slightly softens the 'keeps cancelling' pattern, though it doesn't fully dismiss the frustration",
      "Could briefly mention that it's okay to pull back from making plans if the behavior continues (boundary-setting), though the current approach of checking in first is emotionally intelligent"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a text conversation with an older sibling, using phrases like 'keep your own vibe intact' and 'bails on you'",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Minor missed opportunity to include one subtle emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early on to enhance the warm tone, though the absence doesn't detract significantly",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or lists. Advice is woven into conversational sentences rather than structured as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 😅 after 'left hanging every time') to visually reinforce the warm, casual tone, though the current text-only approach works well",
      "The follow-up question is excellent, but you could add a brief validation that it's okay to prioritize friends who respect their time if this pattern continues after the conversation"
