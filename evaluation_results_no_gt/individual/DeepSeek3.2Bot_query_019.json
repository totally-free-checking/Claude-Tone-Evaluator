      "Strong immediate emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's one of the worst feelings' and acknowledging feeling 'misunderstood'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji 😅 may be slightly mismatched for the serious emotional weight of being accused of cheating, though it captures the awkwardness of the situation",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider either omitting the emoji or choosing one that better matches the seriousness of the situation (such as 😟 or 💙) since 😅 suggests awkward humor that may not align with the stress of being accused of cheating",
      "Add one more first-person validation phrase like 'I get how scary that must feel' or 'I'd be panicking too' to deepen the personal connection before moving to advice"
