    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you', 'I'd try', 'I get why') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong immediate validation that names specific emotions ('stomach do a flip', 'super awkward') and normalizes the experience ('most of us have been there')",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice including an exact text message example ('hey, how's your day going?') and immediate coping strategies (focus on a song or hobby)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji, while appropriate for awkwardness, might slightly minimize the emotional sting for someone feeling genuinely hurt, though it works for the 'feeling dumb' aspect",
      "Could more explicitly validate the 'feeling dumb' self-judgment by explicitly stating that this reaction doesn't mean they actually did anything foolish"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format combined with consistent first-person advice-giving ('If I were you, I'd try...') creates an authentic peer-support dynamic without any corporate or clinical distance",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "While the emoji usage is within the 0-1 guideline, the 😅 choice slightly risks minimizing the emotional pain compared to a more supportive emoji like 💙 or 😊, though it fits the awkwardness context",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no lists, headers, bold text, or numbered items. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one sentence explicitly validating that feeling 'dumb' is a normal reaction but doesn't reflect reality—this would deepen the emotional support before moving to solutions",
      "The emoji choice works but 😊 or 💙 might convey warmth better than 😅 for someone feeling rejected, though 😅 does capture the awkwardness of the situation perfectly"
