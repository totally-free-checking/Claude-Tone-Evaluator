    "strengths": [
      "Maintains excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a continuous text conversation",
      "Offers concrete, realistic advice for teens including reaching out directly and using platform reporting tools",
      "Ends with a supportive first-person statement 'I'm here for you' and offers specific help with wording messages"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person advisory language throughout the advice sections; uses impersonal phrasing like 'you could kindly reach out' and 'Each platform usually has guidelines' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you should'",
      "Does not ask an actual follow-up question to continue the conversation; 'Let me know if...' is a statement/offer rather than an engaging inquiry",
      "Emotional validation is limited to one brief sentence at the beginning, while practical advice dominates the response, creating an imbalance toward solutions"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The pure prose formatting without any bullet points, numbered lists, or excessive structuring, which creates a natural conversational flow appropriate for texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The impersonal, educational tone that resembles a privacy rights guide rather than a supportive friend, missing casual first-person language and emotional warmth in the advice sections",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response consists entirely of three natural paragraphs with no formatting structures, bullet points, or headers, perfectly matching the ideal conversational prose style"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace impersonal advice constructions like 'you could kindly reach out' and 'you can also check' with first-person suggestions such as 'I'd probably text them something like...' or 'I think you should start by...' to create a more personal, friend-like tone",
      "End with an actual question to invite continued dialogue, such as 'Do you know who posted it?' or 'How are you feeling about confronting them?' instead of the current statement format",
      "Expand the emotional validation to balance the practical advice, perhaps by adding 'That's such a violating feeling' or 'Ugh, I'd be so upset too' before jumping into solutions"
