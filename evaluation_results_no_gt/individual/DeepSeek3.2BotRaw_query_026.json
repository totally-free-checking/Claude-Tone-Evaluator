      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use in the conversation (\"What exactly about my attitude are you noticing?\" and \"I see it differently, can I explain my perspective?\")",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that invites the teen to share more about their specific situation (\"Want to talk through what you think he might bring up?\")",
      "Immediately validates the defensive feeling with \"Yeah, that's a rough opener\" and \"Been there,\" acknowledging the annoyance is justified"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a bulleted list for advice instead of natural prose flow (\"Take a breath...\", \"Ask him to be specific...\", \"If you disagree...\") which breaks the conversational tone",
      "Lacks first-person language and perspective - doesn't use \"I think,\" \"I'd say,\" or \"I get it\" to create personal connection, making it feel more like generic advice than a friend's perspective",
      "Could offer more emotional validation before jumping to the strategic advice - only one sentence of validation before \"Maybe you could go in with a little strategy?\""
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question perfectly matches the ideal character - it's natural, specific to the situation, and invites continued conversation rather than closing the topic",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The use of bullet points for the advice section significantly diverges from the ideal prose-only format, making it read more like a self-help article than a text conversation",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "65%",
      "notes": "Response starts and ends with prose but has a 3-item bulleted list in the middle for advice. The bullets contain good content but break the conversational flow. Ideally these would be woven into sentences like 'I'd suggest taking a breath first, then maybe asking him to be specific about what he's noticing...'"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose by connecting the ideas with transitions like 'First, I'd suggest...' or 'You could also try...' to maintain the conversational text-message feel",
      "Add first-person language throughout to create connection - instead of 'Maybe you could go in with a little strategy?' try 'I think going in with a little strategy might help. I'd probably start by taking a breath...'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 🤍) after 'Been there' or 'You’ve got this' to enhance the supportive tone without overdoing it"
