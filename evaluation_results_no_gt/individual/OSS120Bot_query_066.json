      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout creates genuine connection ('I'm so sorry', 'I've found', 'I'm curious')",
      "Perfect prose format with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring",
      "Strong immediate validation using empathetic physical metaphors ('punch to the gut') and normalization ('totally normal', 'most of us get stuck')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji placement after 'punch to the gut' slightly undercuts the empathetic intensity of the physical metaphor",

      "Consider using 💙 or 😊 instead of 😅, or omitting the emoji entirely, to better match the empathetic tone of 'punch to the gut'",
