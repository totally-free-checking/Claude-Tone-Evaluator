    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that stinks!' that acknowledges the frustration and unfairness of the situation",
      "Natural first-person language ('I can help you figure out your options') that creates a supportive, personal connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting, reading like a natural text message"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Very brief length (only 2 sentences) could potentially feel slightly thin, though appropriate as a conversation opener",
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance the casual, warm tone (though none is also acceptable)",
      "Does not provide any specific initial advice before asking the question, though offering to help vent or problem-solve is appropriate"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one well-placed emoji (like 😤 or 😅) after 'Ugh, that stinks!' to enhance the warm, casual tone without overdoing it",
      "While the opening question is perfect, adding one sentence of specific validation about unfair discipline or offering one small initial coping strategy before the question could provide more immediate value while still encouraging conversation"
