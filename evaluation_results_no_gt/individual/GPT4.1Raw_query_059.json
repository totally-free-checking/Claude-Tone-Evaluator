      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text message",
      "Asks engaging, specific follow-up questions that show genuine interest in the details of their situation",
      "Appropriate length - concise but substantial, very readable on mobile"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' makes it feel impersonal rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Offers no practical advice or actionable suggestions - only asks diagnostic questions without giving any 'here's what you could try'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout - use phrases like 'I think sometimes people...' or 'I'd suggest trying...' to create connection",
      "Include 1-2 concrete, actionable suggestions after validating their feelings (e.g., specific scripts they could use or ways to address the imbalance)",
      "Amp up the warmth in the opening - use more enthusiastic validation like 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' before moving to questions"
