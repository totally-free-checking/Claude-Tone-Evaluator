    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads as natural conversational paragraphs",
      "Uses clarifying questions to better understand the specific situation (arguing with each other vs. directed at user)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I'm here' which makes it feel impersonal like an FAQ rather than a supportive friend",
      "Too brief and diagnostic - focuses on gathering information rather than providing emotional support or concrete advice",
      "Ends with a compound question ('Have you tried... or are you...') that feels clinical rather than warmly engaging"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring - maintains conversational paragraph flow throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language and warm personal connection - reads as an observer asking clinical questions rather than a supportive friend sharing the moment",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Response flows as natural paragraphs"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: try 'I get how exhausting that must be' or 'I'd feel so stressed in that situation' instead of general observations",
      "Provide concrete advice before asking diagnostic questions - offer specific phrases they could use when bringing up concerns to the group",
      "Expand the validation section to be warmer and longer before moving to questions - teens need to feel truly heard before problem-solving begins",
      "Replace the compound ending question with a single, warmer invitation to share more, like 'What's the hardest part of being in the middle of all that?'"
