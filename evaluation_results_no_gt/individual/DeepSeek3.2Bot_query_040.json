    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you', 'I'd try', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can literally copy-paste: 'Hey! I'm trying to be better about not being on my phone so much lately, so I might be slower to reply'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up section asks two questions in succession which slightly breaks the 'one natural question' ideal, though they are related",
      "Could include one more sentence of validation between the permission-giving (paragraph 2) and the advice (paragraph 3) to create even smoother transition"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational first-person voice - uses 'I' statements naturally throughout ('If I were you', 'I'd try') making it feel like a real person texting rather than an AI giving instructions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight imbalance toward practical advice over emotional validation - while it opens with validation, the advice section is quite substantial compared to the emotional support portion",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being structured as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding a brief validating bridge between the boundary permission ('it doesn't make you mean') and the advice ('If I were you') such as 'I know it's awkward though, so here's what I'd do' to maintain the support-to-solution ratio",
      "The double question at the end ('Are they a close friend, or more of an acquaintance?') could be simplified to one flowing question like 'Is this a close friend or more of an acquaintance?' to feel slightly more natural"
