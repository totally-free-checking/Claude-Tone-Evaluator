      "Excellent first-person language throughout ('I think this is way more common...', 'I'd maybe try pulling back') creating genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation with a friend",
      "Strong immediate validation opening with 'Aw, that's a tough feeling' and normalization that reduces shame"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The word 'invested' in 'see who's really invested' is slightly formal/adult for teen conversation",
      "Could validate the specific fear of rejection or loneliness a bit more deeply before moving to the 'pull back' strategy"

      "Consider adding one sentence acknowledging how vulnerable it feels to worry that friends don't care enough to text first, before suggesting the 'pull back' strategy",
      "The follow-up question is good, but could be slightly more open-ended like 'What's your gut feeling about why this might be happening?' to invite deeper sharing"
