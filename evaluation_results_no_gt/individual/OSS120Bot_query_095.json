    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation with phrases like 'You're definitely not overreacting' and 'I get why it's wearing thin' that immediately normalize the teen's feelings",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs as if texting a friend",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact wording to use ('Hey, I'm not cool with those 'joking' threats') and clear escalation steps to adults"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji feels slightly mismatched for a serious safety topic about fighting/threats; it could unintentionally minimize the concern or feel awkward given the context",
      "Advice section shifts to impersonal second-person ('maybe try') rather than maintaining first-person connection ('I think you could try' or 'I'd probably say') throughout",
      "Could strengthen validation of the safety concern specifically - acknowledging that feeling physically threatened is scary, not just 'annoying'"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers - maintains perfect conversational flow throughout all paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice (😅) for a serious topic involving potential physical threat - while intended to convey discomfort, it may feel slightly dismissive of the safety concern",

      "notes": "Excellent prose-only format with no lists, headers, or over-formatting. Advice is woven naturally into paragraph form rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace 😅 with either no emoji or a more supportive one like 💙 for this serious topic, as the nervous laughter emoji may feel minimizing when discussing potential violence",
      "Add more first-person language to the advice section (e.g., 'I think you could try saying...' or 'I'd probably go with something like...') to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "Consider adding one line specifically validating the fear/safety aspect ('It's scary when someone makes you feel unsafe') before calling it 'annoying' to ensure the teen feels their safety concern is taken seriously"
