    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst!' and acknowledging it feels 'so unfair' and like being 'cut off from your people'",
      "Perfect natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd...', 'I know it feels like', 'I'd try to sit tight')",
      "Specific, realistic advice that acknowledges teen agency limitations (waiting a week or two before asking, suggesting polite approach)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could explicitly name the 'mad' emotion since the user specifically mentioned being angry, rather than just 'annoyed'",
      "Absence of emoji, while acceptable, could be enhanced with one warm emoji (like 😅) to match the casual opening tone"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 😊) to visually reinforce the casual, friendly tone",
      "Explicitly acknowledge the anger by saying something like 'I totally get why you're mad' to match the user's specific emotional statement",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific, continuing the conversational flow perfectly"
