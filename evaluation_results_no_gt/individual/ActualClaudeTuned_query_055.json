    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' and acknowledging the 'oh no, what did I just do' panic",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think it's better', 'Sometimes I think', 'we've all felt') creating genuine connection",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice is somewhat limited (only suggests deleting or leaving it up) and could offer more specific strategies for managing the anxiety",
      "Could validate slightly more about the specific fear of judgment before jumping to 'most people scroll past' perspective"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Conversational prose format and first-person language usage - perfectly captures the 'supportive friend' voice without any corporate or structured formatting",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, bullet points, or numbered lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one specific coping strategy for the immediate anxiety (like 'taking a walk for 10 minutes before deciding whether to delete') to complement the delete/keep advice",
      "The validation is strong but could briefly acknowledge the specific vulnerability of posting regrets before offering the perspective that others don't notice as much"
