    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' and 'I totally get why that would stress you out' that makes the teen feel heard",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think we feel guilty', 'I'd say') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic text scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I'm pretty busy with school/family stuff right now...') rather than vague advice"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could be slightly softer with one more sentence acknowledging how hard boundaries are before jumping to 'Honestly, most people don't even realize...'",
      "Uses 'we' in 'Sometimes I think we feel guilty' which creates solidarity but could be more specific to the teen's experience with 'you'"

      "Maintain the immediate validation opening - starting with 'Ugh' and 'I totally get' is exactly the right energy for teen support",
      "Keep providing specific scripts/phrases teens can copy-paste or adapt, as these are incredibly actionable",
      "The follow-up question about closeness vs acquaintance is perfect - continue asking specific contextual questions that help tailor future advice"
