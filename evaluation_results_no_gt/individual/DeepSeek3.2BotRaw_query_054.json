      "Opens with immediate validation ('I'm really sorry you're dealing with that') and affirms the user's right to safety",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts like 'I don't appreciate comments about my body. Please stop' that a teen could actually use",
      "Uses exactly one appropriate emoji (💙) at the end to enhance warmth without being excessive"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers ('1. **Set a clear boundary**') rather than natural prose paragraphs",
      "Completely lacks a follow-up question to continue the conversation",
      "Uses impersonal language like 'here are a few things you could consider' and 'there may be policies in place' instead of first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say')"

      "Convert the four bullet points into 1-2 flowing paragraphs using natural transitions like 'If it were me, I'd probably start by...' or 'You could try telling them something like...'",
      "End with a specific, engaging question like 'Do you feel safe telling them directly to stop, or is this someone you need to avoid entirely?'",
      "Incorporate first-person language throughout the advice section, such as 'I think setting a boundary would be my first move' instead of 'Here are things you could consider'"
