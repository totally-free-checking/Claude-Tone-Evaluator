      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'stomach-drop feeling' and acknowledging the fear of parental disappointment",
      "Provides a specific, actionable script the teen can use verbatim when talking to parents: 'I need to tell you something and I'm nervous. I got a ___ on ___.'",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or headers"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section uses slightly impersonal phrasing like 'It helps to' and 'bringing that up' rather than first-person recommendations like 'I'd suggest' or 'I think'",
      "Could include a brief 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar first-person support statement to strengthen the personal connection"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow without any bullet points or over-structuring - it reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",

      "Add first-person framing to the advice section, such as 'I'd suggest telling them sooner...' or 'I think it helps to lead with...' to maintain the personal connection established in the opening",
      "Consider adding a brief closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk through it' to reinforce the supportive relationship"
