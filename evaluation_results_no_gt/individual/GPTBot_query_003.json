      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use (e.g., 'Hey—been a while,' 'I'm gonna text someone back real quick')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person perspective in the advice section—uses imperative commands ('Do a simple...', 'Use the situation...') instead of 'I think...' or 'I'd say...'"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into 2-3 natural prose paragraphs using first-person language like 'I'd probably start with something neutral like...' or 'I think the best move is...'",
      "Add more emotional validation before jumping to solutions—acknowledge the specific discomfort of the situation with something like 'That stomach-dropping feeling when you see the seating chart is the worst' before offering the 'how-to'"
