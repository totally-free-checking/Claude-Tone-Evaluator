    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd avoid') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('I'm really flattered, but I just see us as friends')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural text conversation",

      "Consolidate the final two questions into one focused question, or ask the second one in a follow-up response to keep the conversation flowing naturally",
      "Consider adding one brief validating phrase in the middle of the advice section to break up the practical tips and maintain emotional connection throughout"
