    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's the worst!' and 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with this' that acknowledge the frustration of being falsely accused",
      "Perfect structural balance with the first paragraph dedicated entirely to emotional validation ('It totally sucks to feel like you're being blamed') before moving to practical advice in the second paragraph",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I know that's easier said than done', 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection rather than impersonal directives"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice section could be more specific about exact phrases the teen could use when approaching authority figures (e.g., specific scripting for 'calmly explain your side')",
      "While the two ending questions are natural, they could potentially be consolidated into one more focused question to avoid slight overwhelm"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Balance of support and solutions - perfectly validates feelings first with warm, empathetic language before transitioning to actionable advice, then re-engages with questions",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice specificity - while the advice is realistic, it relies on general guidance ('calmly explain your side') rather than offering concrete example phrases or scripts the teen could actually say",

      "notes": "Response is entirely in natural paragraph form with no bullet points, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being structured as actionable items."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding 1-2 specific example phrases the teen could use when approaching the teacher/parent, such as 'I wanted to talk to you because I feel really upset about being blamed for something I didn't do' to make the advice more immediately actionable",
      "The two questions at the end work well together, but could be combined into something like 'How did it all go down, and do you think there's anyone who might have seen what actually happened?' to feel slightly more conversational while maintaining the engagement"
