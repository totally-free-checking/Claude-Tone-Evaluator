      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using first-person empathy: 'Ugh, that guilt... I totally get it—it's such a heavy feeling'",
      "Uses natural prose throughout with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the difficult conversation: 'I've enjoyed this, but it's not fitting my life right now...'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance warmth (though the absence is acceptable for the serious tone)",
      "Ends with two connected questions rather than a single focused question, though they flow naturally together"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining readability",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with three flowing paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or structural formatting. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than listed out."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji early in the response (like 😅 or 💙) to signal warmth while maintaining the serious tone",
      "The follow-up question works well but could be slightly more focused by asking either about the specific activity OR the duration, rather than both, to encourage a more detailed response to one aspect"
