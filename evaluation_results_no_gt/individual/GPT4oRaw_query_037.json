      "Excellent prose formatting with no bullet points or over-structuring - reads as a natural conversational flow",
      "Appropriate length that is substantial but not overwhelming, easy to read on a phone"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think', 'I'd feel', or 'I get it' makes it feel impersonal and detached rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Minimizes the teen's concern by suggesting it 'can be harmless' before fully validating their feelings, which may feel dismissive",
      "Asks two questions at once ('Are you okay? Do you have any idea...') which feels slightly interrogative rather than inviting a natural conversation",
      "Offers to 'come up with ways to handle it' but provides zero concrete advice or specific suggestions in the response"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, maintaining a conversational paragraph structure throughout",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Complete absence of first-person language and personal connection - reads as impersonal observation rather than empathetic peer support",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or structured formatting. The response flows as natural sentences without any bullet points or numbered lists."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language to create connection: instead of 'that can feel really uncomfortable,' try 'I get how uncomfortable that must feel' or 'I'd be so anxious if I overheard that'",
      "Remove minimizing language like 'sometimes it can be harmless' when someone is seeking support - validate first, explore possibilities later if needed",
      "Provide one concrete piece of advice before asking questions, such as suggesting they could text a friend or take a breath before reacting",
      "Consolidate the two questions into one engaging, specific question like 'What do you think they were talking about?' or 'Do you want to vent about what you heard?'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji like 😬 or 💙 early in the response to soften the tone and signal emotional safety"
