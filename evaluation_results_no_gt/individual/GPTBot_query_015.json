      "Excellent specific scripts and actionable advice (e.g., 'I'm not okay with you going through my things. It needs to stop,' and the 'pause script' for de-escalation)",
      "Follow-up questions are specific and relevant to the situation (asking about ages, room type, and whether things are missing vs. snooping)"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language - no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' anywhere; reads like an impersonal guide rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Severely over-structured with 6 numbered headers and multiple bullet lists, resembling a wikiHow article rather than a text from a supportive friend",
      "Jumps to solutions too quickly with minimal emotional validation - only one brief sentence acknowledging feelings before diving into 6 sections of advice"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides concrete, realistic strategies and exact wording a teen can use immediately",

      "notes": "Response is structured as 6 numbered sections (## 1) through ## 6)) with multiple sub-bullets under each. Only 1-2 sentences at the beginning are in prose form. Reads like an instructional guide rather than a conversation."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Rewrite as 2-3 natural paragraphs instead of numbered sections - integrate the advice into flowing sentences like 'I'd probably start by waiting until you're calm, then saying something like...'",
      "Add first-person connection throughout - use phrases like 'I get why you're furious,' 'I'd feel violated too,' or 'I think the best approach would be...' to sound like a real person talking",
      "Lead with emotional validation for at least a full paragraph before offering solutions - acknowledge how invasive and disrespectful this feels before jumping to lockbox recommendations",
      "Condense advice to 1-2 key strategies instead of overwhelming with 6 different approaches - pick the most relevant and describe them conversationally"
