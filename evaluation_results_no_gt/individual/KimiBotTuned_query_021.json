    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific acknowledgment of feelings ('violating and embarrassing', 'mad or anxious') and normalization ('you're not being dramatic')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation with specific script suggestions embedded in sentences",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact wording to use ('Hey, you posted a pic of me without asking. Please delete it') and concrete steps (screenshot, report, involve school)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji choice is slightly awkward for a violating/privacy situation - while only one emoji is used (good), a more supportive choice like 💙 or 😔 might better match the serious nature of non-consensual photography",
      "Could incorporate more explicit first-person advisory language like 'I think' or 'I'd probably start by' to strengthen the personal connection in the advice section",
      "The third paragraph is quite dense with multiple conditional scenarios (school, sexual content, etc.) which could be slightly overwhelming"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while embedding practical advice within natural sentences",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji selection (😅) doesn't perfectly match the serious/violating emotional tone of the situation, though usage quantity is ideal",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as three natural paragraphs with no bullet points, bold text, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using a more empathetic emoji like 💙 or 😔 for serious privacy violations, or omitting entirely if the situation feels too heavy for emoji use",
      "Break up the long third paragraph slightly or use 'I think...' framing to make the conditional advice (school vs. platform vs. sexual content) feel more like personal guidance than instructions",
      "Add an explicit first-person supportive closing like 'I'm here if you need to talk through next steps' to strengthen the personal connection"
