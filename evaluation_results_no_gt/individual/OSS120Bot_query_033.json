      "Opens with immediate validation using 'Ugh, I get why that's so irritating' and 'total vibe-kill' which perfectly captures teen frustration",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for talking to the teacher ('Hey, I noticed I got moved...') rather than vague advice",
      "Maintains 100% natural prose with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to strengthen the personal connection (currently relies heavily on 'I get')",

      "Consider using 😊 or 💙 instead of 😅 since the user expressed being 'mad' rather than embarrassed, though the current emoji works for the 'vibe-kill' context"
