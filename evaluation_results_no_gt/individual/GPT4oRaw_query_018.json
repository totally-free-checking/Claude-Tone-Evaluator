    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers - reads like a natural conversation in three flowing paragraphs",
      "Strong opening validation that immediately acknowledges the difficulty of the situation ('I'm really sorry you're dealing with that right now,' 'it's okay to feel upset, anxious, or even helpless')",
      "Good balance between emotional support and practical advice, starting with validation before moving to coping strategies"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing follow-up question at the end - closes with a statement ('I'm here to listen anytime!') rather than engaging the user to continue the conversation",
      "Language is somewhat formal/clinical ('unsettling,' 'grounding yourself,' 'natural reaction') rather than casual teen conversation ('Ugh, that's so stressful,' 'I get how overwhelming that is')",
      "Could use more first-person connection phrases like 'I'd feel the same way' or 'I've been there' to strengthen the personal bond"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting - perfectly avoids bullet points, headers, and over-structuring while maintaining clear paragraph breaks that feel like texting paragraphs",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Follow-up question engagement - completely omits a closing question which is essential for the conversational teen support character; should ask something specific like 'Do you have headphones or music you can put on right now?' or 'Is this happening a lot lately?'",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice is integrated naturally into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a specific, engaging question at the end to continue the conversation, such as 'Do you have a favorite show or playlist you can put on to drown it out?' or 'Is this the first time you've heard them fight like this, or does it happen a lot?'",
      "Replace formal therapeutic language with more casual friend-language: instead of 'grounding yourself' and 'natural reaction,' try something like 'honestly, anyone would feel anxious hearing that' or 'maybe throw on some headphones and zone out for a bit'",
      "While the first-person 'I think' is good, add more personal connection phrases like 'I'd be freaking out too' or 'I remember how much that sucked when I was in high school' to feel less like a counselor and more like a supportive friend"
