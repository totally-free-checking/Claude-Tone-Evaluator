    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific language acknowledging the 'panic' and 'heavy' feeling of potential failure",
      "Excellent use of first-person advice format ('If I were you, I'd...') that feels like a supportive friend sharing personal perspective",
      "Provides a concrete, realistic script for talking to teachers: 'I'm worried I'm not going to pass—can you tell me what I need to do to bring my grade up?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Contains a foreign language artifact 'конкрет' (Russian for 'concrete') which appears to be a typo or translation error, disrupting the natural flow",
      "Could slightly expand the emotional validation before transitioning to advice, though the current balance is still strong"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, creating a seamless conversational flow that reads like a text from a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The presence of the foreign word 'конкрет' which appears to be an error and slightly undermines the otherwise polished, native conversational tone",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace 'конкрет' with 'concrete' to fix the apparent translation error",
      "Consider adding one more validating phrase like 'That fear is totally valid' before the 'If I were you' advice section to make the transition even smoother",
      "The follow-up question is excellent and specific—maintain this level of engagement in future responses"
