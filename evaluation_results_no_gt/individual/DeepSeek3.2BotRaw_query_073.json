    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Yeah, that can be exhausting' and the relatable 'Olympics of everyday life' metaphor",
      "Excellent specific, actionable advice with actual scripts the teen can use (e.g., 'Wow, are we keeping score? Should I get a whiteboard?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers instead of natural conversational prose - reads like a self-help article rather than a text from a friend",
      "Complete absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') making it feel impersonal and detached",
      "No follow-up question at the end to continue the conversation - closes with a statement instead of engagement"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - provides specific, realistic phrases and strategies that a teen could actually use in the moment",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs bullet points - uses 4 formatted bullet points with bold headers instead of flowing conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses 4 distinct bullet points with bold category headers (Humor or deflection, Acknowledge and pivot, Reframe it, Talk about it gently later). This creates a structured, listicle format that breaks conversational flow. The advice should be woven into natural sentences rather than presented as a checklist."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into natural prose paragraphs - instead of listing options, weave them into a conversational flow like 'If you want to try humor, you could say... Or if that doesn't feel right, you could just acknowledge and pivot by saying...'",
      "Add first-person perspective throughout - use phrases like 'I think that might come from insecurity' or 'I'd probably try saying something like...' to make it feel like a real person sharing advice, not an article",
      "End with an engaging follow-up question specific to their situation, such as 'Has your friend always been like this, or did it start recently?' or 'How do you usually react when they turn things into a competition?'"
