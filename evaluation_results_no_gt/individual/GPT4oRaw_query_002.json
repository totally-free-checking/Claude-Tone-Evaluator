    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or over-structuring—it reads like a natural text message",
      "Opens with strong validation using first-person language ('I feel you') and empathetic phrasing ('that's the worst')",
      "Provides realistic, age-appropriate advice that acknowledges teen agency limitations (suggesting honesty and makeup work rather than elaborate excuses)"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end—closes with 'You've got this!' instead of engaging the user to share more",
      "Lacks first-person perspective in the advice section ('Just be honest' vs 'I'd just be honest' or 'I think you should')",

      "Add a natural follow-up question at the end like 'How did it go with your teacher?' or 'Is this a class where you feel comfortable being honest about forgetting?'",
      "Incorporate more first-person language throughout the advice section—change 'Just be honest' to 'I'd just be honest' and 'Offer to get it done' to 'I'd offer to get it done'",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though this is optional"
