    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with relatable language like 'That split-second panic when you realize you blanked on an assignment is seriously the worst' and 'makes you want to disappear for a second'",
      "Excellent use of first-person natural language throughout: 'I totally get', 'If I were you, I'd just come clean', creating a supportive peer-like connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use: 'I'm really sorry, I completely forgot about the homework. Is there any way I can turn it in late?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition from validation to advice could include one more sentence acknowledging the specific anxiety about facing the teacher to make the emotional support-to-solution flow even smoother",
      "Could briefly acknowledge that forgetting homework happens even to organized students to further reduce shame, though 'everyone has those moments' partially addresses this"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text message from a friend with perfect conversational flow",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Nothing significantly diverges; if anything, the response could slightly deepen the validation before offering the 'everyone does this' normalization, but this is a minor refinement",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being itemized"
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one sentence between the first and second paragraphs specifically validating the fear of the teacher's reaction before moving to 'everyone has those moments'",
      "The follow-up question is excellent, but could be split into two options (already done well with 'or are you still dreading that conversation') to cover both scenarios"
