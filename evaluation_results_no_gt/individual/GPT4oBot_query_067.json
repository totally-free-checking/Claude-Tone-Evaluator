      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I totally get how overwhelming that feels!' that mirrors the teen's frustration",
      "Provides a specific, realistic script the teen can actually use: 'I appreciate you wanting to plan ahead, but I feel like it's too early for me to make big decisions yet. Can we talk about it more next year?'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could use more first-person language in the advice section (uses 'maybe you can' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could')",
