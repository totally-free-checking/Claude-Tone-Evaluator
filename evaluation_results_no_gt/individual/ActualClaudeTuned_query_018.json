      "Immediate emotional validation with 'I'm so sorry you're dealing with this right now' and 'That's really tough' that acknowledges the difficulty of the situation",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I know,' 'I think,' 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Natural follow-up question that specifically references the user's 'again' by asking 'Is this something that's been happening a lot lately, or just tonight?' showing active listening"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly enhance practical advice by offering specific script suggestions for talking to parents (e.g., 'Hey, I can hear you arguing and it really stresses me out')",

      "The validation is strong but could explicitly name the 'again' aspect early on (e.g., 'Having to hear them fight again must feel exhausting') to show you noticed that detail"
