    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation opening with relatable language like 'heart-stopping oh crap feeling' and 'brain goes completely blank' that immediately normalizes the experience",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use word-for-word ('I completely spaced on this—I'm so sorry') rather than vague advice",
      "Ends with a natural, context-specific follow-up question about the subject that shows genuine interest in tailoring the advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers (**Right now:**, **Damage control:**, etc.) and bullet points which breaks the conversational prose format - reads more like an instruction manual than a text from a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person singular language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'If I were you') - uses impersonal instructional tone ('Here's your survival guide', 'Just own it honestly') instead of connecting as a supportive peer",
      "The 'survival guide' framing feels more like a WikiHow article than a supportive conversation, creating distance rather than intimacy"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The emotional validation in the opening paragraph perfectly captures the teen experience with phrases like 'the dreaded moment' and acknowledging the physical panic response",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The heavy use of headers, bold text, and bullet points under 'Damage control' makes it feel like a structured self-help article rather than natural conversational prose",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response uses 4 bold headers (**Right now:**, **If you can actually do it quickly:**, **Damage control:**, **The silver lining:**) and 3 bullet points under Damage control. The advice is delivered in structured segments rather than flowing naturally within paragraphs."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace headers and bullet points with flowing paragraphs - instead of **Damage control:** followed by bullets, write something like 'I'd also suggest not over-apologizing or making up wild stories... Instead, just set a specific time you'll turn it in and stick to it.'",
      "Add first-person language to create connection - change 'Here's your survival guide' to 'I think the best approach is to just own it honestly...' and 'Teachers usually respect honesty' to 'In my experience, teachers respect honesty...'",
      "Integrate the advice into a natural narrative flow rather than segmented sections, using transitions like 'If you can bang it out quickly, I'd suggest offering to get it done by 3pm today...'"
