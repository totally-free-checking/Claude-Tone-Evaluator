    "strengths": [
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout (e.g., 'Honestly, I think guilt around quitting is super normal', 'I'd say try to figure out...') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides immediate emotional validation ('I'm so sorry you're feeling stuck like that') and normalizes difficult feelings without dismissing them",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation between friends"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice could include one specific example phrase or script for how to actually communicate the decision to quit",
      "While advice mentions 'give some notice' and 'finish out a season,' it could be slightly more concrete about what respectful communication looks like in practice"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose conversation style with consistent first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') that creates an authentic, supportive friend-like tone",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice specificity - while the guidance is realistic, it lacks concrete scripting examples for the actual conversation of quitting",

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as conversational prose with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

      "Consider adding one brief example of specific phrasing the teen could use when communicating their decision (e.g., 'You could say something like...') to make the advice more actionable",
      "Maintain this excellent balance of validation-first structure and natural first-person language; this is exactly the right tone for teen support"
