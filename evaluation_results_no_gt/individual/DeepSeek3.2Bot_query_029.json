    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I've totally been there,' 'I think,' 'I'd try') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for talking to the coach ('Hey Coach, about earlier—I heard you. I'm on it.') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji could potentially be interpreted as minimizing the embarrassment rather than expressing empathetic awkwardness, though context helps",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with consistent first-person conversational language that sounds like a supportive older sibling texting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji choice (😅) at the end of the validation paragraph, while attempting to convey shared awkwardness, risks coming across as laughing at their pain rather than with them",

      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no formatting, headers, or bullet lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."

      "Consider using 😊 or 💙 instead of 😅 for serious embarrassment situations to ensure the warmth lands clearly without ambiguity",
      "The specific script provided for talking to the coach is excellent—maintain this level of concrete, phrase-level advice in future responses"
