    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'If I were you', 'I might bring it up') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for the conversation ('Hey, I love hanging out with you...') that a teen could actually use",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural flow - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting, with zero structural formatting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The perspective shift ('it usually feels way bigger to you than it does to them') could potentially minimize the friend's behavior slightly before fully validating the hurt feelings, though it balances well overall",
      "Could explicitly validate the friendship value ('you clearly value this friendship') before moving to the 'they might just be overwhelmed' perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with first-person advice delivery - uses 'I'd say', 'If I were you', and 'I might' throughout, making it feel like a real person sharing personal perspective rather than an AI dispensing generic advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Slight potential for the 'feels way bigger to you than them' line to come across as minimizing, though contextually it works to reduce anxiety about the friendship ending",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out. Uses paragraph breaks for readability without over-structuring."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Continue using specific dialogue scripts like 'Hey, I love hanging out with you...' - this is incredibly helpful for teens who don't know what to say",
      "Consider adding one more line of explicit validation about why this hurts (e.g., 'It makes sense you'd feel disrespected') before the perspective shift about the friend's intentions",
      "Maintain the current emoji restraint - the single 💙 at the end of the first paragraph is perfectly placed to add warmth without being excessive"
