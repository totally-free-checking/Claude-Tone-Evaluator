    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry that happened' and acknowledging the boundary violation",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use: 'Hey, I saw you posted that picture of me, but I'm not comfortable with it. Could you take it down?'",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd suggest', 'I'm so sorry', 'I get it' implied in tone)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The transition between the direct conversation advice and the adult backup suggestion could flow slightly more naturally",
      "Could potentially include one more validating phrase about how common/annoying this situation is before moving to solutions, though the balance is already quite good"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with absolutely no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring - maintains conversational flow throughout while delivering practical advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question is slightly compound (asking two things at once), though still natural and engaging",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses four clean paragraphs with no formatting gimmicks, bullet lists, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Maintain this exact prose-first approach - avoiding bullet points makes it feel like a real conversation rather than a self-help article",
      "The specific script provided is excellent; continue offering exact phrases teens can use when they're nervous about confrontation",
      "Consider adding one more 'I' statement like 'I know it's nerve-wracking but...' to strengthen the first-person connection even further"
