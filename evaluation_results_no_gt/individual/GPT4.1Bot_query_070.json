    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's such an awkward situation' and 'I totally get how that could make you feel caught in the middle'",
      "Excellent natural use of first-person language throughout, including 'If I were you, I'd probably try' and 'I totally get', creating a personal connection",
      "Specific actionable advice with exact script suggestions: 'Hey, I didn't mean to make you feel left out—hanging out with someone else didn't change how much I care about our friendship'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😬) early in the response to visually reinforce the casual, empathetic tone, though the text warmth is strong",
      "The transition to advice could briefly acknowledge that the friend might need a cooling-off period before the conversation, though this is minor"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points, maintaining a smooth conversational flow that reads like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Complete absence of emojis when one might have enhanced the warm, casual tone (though the warmth is conveyed effectively through text alone)",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, maintaining a conversational text-message style throughout."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one casual emoji (like 😅 or 😬) after the opening 'Ugh' to visually reinforce the empathetic, informal tone",
      "Maintain the excellent balance of validation-to-advice ratio seen here, where feelings are acknowledged before practical solutions are offered",
      "The follow-up question about whether this is a pattern is perfectly specific and engaging—continue using situational questions rather than generic 'How are you feeling?' prompts"
