      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that sounds so rough' and 'I'm really sorry you're stuck in the middle of that' creates instant warmth and safety",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I'd try throwing on some headphones,' 'I know it feels huge') makes it feel like a supportive friend rather than a bot"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Doesn't explicitly acknowledge the 'again' aspect of recurring fights mentioned in the query, missing an opportunity to validate the exhaustion of repeated conflict",
      "The follow-up question combines two questions ('What usually helps... or is there something specific...') which, while natural, could be slightly more focused"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Warmth & Emotional Validation - perfectly balances acknowledging the difficulty ('the whole world feel tense') with reassurance ('It's not your fault at all') without being patronizing",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Recognition of recurring pattern - while it mentions 'these kinds of arguments happen,' it misses validating the specific frustration of this happening 'again' as the teen emphasized",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent use of pure prose format with four natural paragraphs. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed, using phrases like 'I'd try' and 'maybe step out' to weave suggestions into conversational narrative."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Explicitly acknowledge the 'again' to validate the exhaustion of recurring parental conflict: 'Having this happen again must feel especially draining'",
      "Consider adding one more specific coping mechanism for immediate relief (like a grounding technique or specific playlist suggestion) to slightly increase the advice-to-validation ratio while maintaining the warm tone"
