      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that really sucks' and 'I totally get that mix of annoyance'",
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points or headers—reads like a natural text conversation",

      "Lacks first-person advisory language in the solution section (uses imperative 'try to find out' instead of 'I'd suggest trying to find out' or 'I think you should')",

      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the end of the first paragraph to enhance visual warmth, though the prose is already warm enough without it"
