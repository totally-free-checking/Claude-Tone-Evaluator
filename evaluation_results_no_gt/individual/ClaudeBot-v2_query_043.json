    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with specific language about the 'twisty feeling' and second-guessing that captures the exact emotional experience",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd try...', 'I'm so sorry') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, word-for-word scripts a teen can actually use ('Can I ask you about something? I've been feeling confused...') rather than vague advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is technically two questions combined, which slightly dilutes the focus, though both are relevant",
      "The third paragraph is slightly dense with advice; could benefit from a line break before the script example, though this is minor"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "The natural conversational prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The follow-up question combines two distinct inquiries (what the lie is about vs. how they found out) which could feel slightly overwhelming, though both show genuine interest",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No headers, bold text, or list formatting. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider breaking the advice paragraph into two smaller chunks for easier phone reading, though the content is excellent",
      "The follow-up question could be simplified to one focused question like 'What makes you think they're lying?' to keep the conversation flowing more naturally, though the current version shows deep engagement"
