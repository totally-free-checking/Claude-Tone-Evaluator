    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('That sounds a bit nerve-wracking!') acknowledging the user's feelings",
      "Uses casual, teen-appropriate language like 'not your vibe' and 'cliquey' that feels authentic",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice such as asking the friend to introduce them and giving permission to leave early",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging question about their gut feeling that invites further conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Relies on bullet points for core advice delivery ('A few things that might help you decide:') rather than flowing prose",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') making the response feel impersonal and detached",
      "Misses opportunity for stronger emotional validation language like 'We've all been there' or 'That's so relatable'"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Practical advice quality - the suggestions are concrete, realistic for a teen's agency, and immediately actionable (asking for introductions, going for a short time, leaving early)",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose vs. bullet points - the response structures the main advice as a bulleted list rather than conversational paragraphs, breaking the texting-like flow",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "65%",
      "notes": "Uses 'A few things that might help you decide:' as a header followed by three bullet points containing the primary practical advice. This creates a structured, listicle format rather than natural conversational flow."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Convert the bullet points into flowing prose by connecting the ideas naturally (e.g., 'I'd suggest asking your friend to introduce you around when you arrive. And honestly? Going for just a short time is totally fine—you can always dip out early if the vibe isn't right. Most people are actually pretty friendly at these things.')",
      "Integrate first-person language throughout to create connection and warmth (e.g., 'I get how intimidating that feels,' 'I think the best approach is...,' or 'I'm here to help you figure this out')",
      "Consider adding slightly stronger upfront validation like 'Ugh, that's such a tricky spot' or 'We've all been there' before moving to the questions"
