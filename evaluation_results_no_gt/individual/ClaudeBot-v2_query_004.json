    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry — that \"why are you suddenly acting different?\" feeling is the worst' which names the specific anxiety and validates it",
      "Excellent use of first-person advice language: 'If I were you, I'd send one calm, direct message' and 'I'd back off a bit' which creates personal connection rather than impersonal directives",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use: 'Hey, you've seemed kinda off lately. Did I do something, or are you just dealing with stuff? I'm here either way'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The 😅 emoji following 'spiral so fast' could potentially minimize the anxiety slightly, though it works for self-aware humor",
      "Could include one more 'I' statement in the middle paragraph to maintain first-person connection throughout the entire response"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or over-structuring, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "The emoji choice (😅) placement, while acceptable, slightly conflicts with the gravity of the 'worst' feeling described",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being itemized"

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider using 😟 or 😕 instead of 😅 when describing anxiety spirals to better match the emotional weight, or place the 😅 earlier to signal the awkwardness of the situation",
      "Add one more first-person reflection in the perspective paragraph (e.g., 'I know when I've been stressed, I sometimes go dry on texts too') to strengthen the personal connection throughout"
