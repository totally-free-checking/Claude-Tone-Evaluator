    "strengths": [
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('I really appreciate you asking, but I don't see you that way')",
      "Maintains natural prose format without any bullet points or over-structuring",
      "Balances validation with advice well - acknowledges the awkwardness before jumping to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd suggest') making it feel more instructional than conversational",
      "Ends with an invitation rather than a specific follow-up question to continue the dialogue",
      "Validation is somewhat generic ('That's totally okay') rather than deeply empathetic or specific to the awkwardness of the situation"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a text message rather than a self-help article",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or structured formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences."

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person language throughout (e.g., 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd probably say something like...') to create a more personal, friend-like connection",
      "Replace the closing invitation with a specific question like 'Do you want to stay friends with them, or would you prefer some space?' to keep the conversation going",
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) early in the response to soften the tone, or deepen the emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that stomach-dropping feeling when you have to let someone down'"
