    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I think', 'I'd check') creating genuine personal connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or structural formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with specific acknowledgment of physical feelings ('that sinking feeling', 'Your heart just drops')",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice tailored to school environment (mentioning cafeteria, locker, front office, lost-and-found specifically)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Emoji choice (😅) is slightly tonally mismatched with 'absolute worst' - implies nervous laughter/embarrassment rather than empathy for stress, potentially minimizing the feeling",
      "The rapid-fire list of locations ('every class, the cafeteria, the hallways, your locker – even the bathroom') could feel slightly overwhelming to someone already panicking"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points, headers, or over-structuring while maintaining clear organization through paragraph breaks",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while sparing (only one), the 😅 choice conveys nervous embarrassment rather than warmth or solidarity, making it feel slightly out of place after describing the situation as 'the absolute worst'",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, perfectly matching the ideal conversational texting style."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Replace the 😅 with either no emoji or a more supportive choice like 💙 or 🤗 to better match the empathetic tone of the rest of the response",
      "Consider softening the list of locations slightly (e.g., 'think through your day - classes, lunch, locker stops') to feel less like a checklist during a moment of panic",
      "The validation is excellent - maintain this immediate emotional acknowledgment before practical advice in future responses"
