    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd try,' 'I think') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Argh, that's so frustrating' and 'It's the worst when' that acknowledge the teen's feelings right away",
      "Perfect prose format with natural paragraph flow—zero bullet points, headers, or over-formatting",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact script the teen could use: 'Hey, I value our friendship a lot, but I also want to make other connections'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks an emoji that could enhance warmth for this frustrating social situation (though the absence isn't major)",
      "The transition from validation to analyzing the friend's 'insecurities' happens quickly—could linger slightly longer on the teen's feelings before explaining the friend's perspective"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting and conversational first-person tone that reads like a supportive friend texting rather than an advice column",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage—while zero emojis is within acceptable range, one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) could have enhanced the empathetic tone for this specific situation",

      "notes": "Response uses four natural paragraphs with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "specific_feedback": [
      "Consider adding one warm emoji (like 😅 or 💙) at the beginning or end to enhance the supportive tone for this frustrating situation",
      "The analysis of the friend's 'insecurities' is accurate but could come slightly later in the response after more validation of the teen's specific feelings in this moment"
