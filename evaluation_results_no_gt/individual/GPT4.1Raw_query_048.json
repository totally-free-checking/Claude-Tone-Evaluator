    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers—reads like a natural text conversation",
      "Strong use of first-person language ('I'm here,' 'I've got your back') that creates genuine connection and warmth",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('That really sucks,' 'I'm sorry you're going through that') that acknowledges the unfairness of the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question to continue the conversation—ends with a statement rather than engagement",
      "Lacks concrete practical advice; offers validation and perspective ('you have your own strengths') but no actionable strategies for handling the comparisons",
      "Heavy imbalance toward emotional support without practical solutions—doesn't offer specific phrases to use with family or coping strategies"

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose formatting with conversational flow and appropriate first-person language that feels like texting with a supportive friend",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add a specific follow-up question at the end like 'What's the comparison that bothers you most?' or 'Do you want to talk about what they were saying?' to keep the conversation going",
      "Include one concrete piece of actionable advice, such as specific phrases they could use when being compared ('I feel frustrated when I'm compared to [sibling] because...') or a strategy for redirecting the conversation",
      "Consider adding one subtle emoji (like 💙 or 😅) early in the response to enhance the warm, casual tone, though the current no-emoji approach is acceptable"
