    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledging the 'spotlight' feeling",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd probably grab', 'I'm so sorry', 'I think' implied in tone)",
      "Specific, actionable advice with exact phrases a teen could use ('Yo, is this seat taken?', 'How'd you do on the quiz?')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - no lists or headers"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from one warm emoji (like 😅 or 😊) to enhance the casual, friendly tone, though the warmth comes through in text",

    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural conversational prose with first-person language - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice without any bullet points or over-formatting",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Emoji usage - while 0 emojis is acceptable, one well-placed emoji could have enhanced the warmth for this socially awkward situation",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with four natural paragraphs. No bullet points, headers, bold text, or lists. Advice flows organically within sentences rather than being itemized."

      "Consider adding one emoji (like 😅 after 'trying to act chill' or 😊 at the end) to visually signal warmth in a text-based medium",
      "The response is exemplary overall - maintain this balance of validation-first followed by specific, low-pressure actionable steps"
