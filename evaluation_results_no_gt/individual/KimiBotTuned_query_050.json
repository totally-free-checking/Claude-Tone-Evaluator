    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's the worst') and acknowledges the specific feelings of tension and humiliation",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts for what to say to both the partner ('Let's just split it up...') and the teacher, making the advice immediately usable",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') throughout the response, using second-person 'you' and impersonal constructions instead",
      "Could include a brief statement of ongoing support like 'I'm here if you need to talk' to establish the supportive relationship"
    ],
    "most_ideal_aspect": "Natural prose format with specific dialogue scripts integrated seamlessly into conversational paragraphs rather than listed as bullet points",
    "least_ideal_aspect": "Absence of first-person language makes the advice feel slightly impersonal despite the warm tone; reads more like general guidance than 'what I would do'",

    "specific_feedback": [
      "Add first-person perspective phrases like 'I think the best approach is...' or 'I'd try to keep it...' to make it feel more like advice from a supportive friend rather than general instructions",
      "Consider adding a brief closing statement like 'I'm here if you need to talk through it more' to reinforce the supportive relationship and open the door for continued conversation"
