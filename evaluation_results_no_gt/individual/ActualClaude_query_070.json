      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - reads like a natural text conversation flowing between paragraphs",

      "Completely lacks first-person language - uses detached 'it' statements ('It could be that', 'It might help') instead of personal connection ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get that')",
