    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that sounds really draining' and 'I get how exhausting it is' that acknowledge the emotional weight",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs like 'If you can, try carving out a little quiet zone...'",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('Hey, I've noticed things get pretty heated lately...') and realistic options like stepping out for coffee breaks"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective in the advice section - uses 'you could' and 'try' instead of 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you could', making it slightly less personal",
      "The follow-up question is technically two questions joined together ('How have you tried... and what feels most doable...'), which slightly violates the 'avoid multiple questions at once' guideline"

      "Integrate more first-person language into the advice section, such as 'I'd probably try carving out...' or 'I think the best approach would be...' to increase the personal, friend-to-friend feel",
      "Consider condensing the follow-up into a single focused question rather than a compound question, or ensure the two parts feel like one natural inquiry"
