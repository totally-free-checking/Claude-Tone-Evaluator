    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think you're probably picking up on something real,' 'I think it might be worth saying something') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use ('ouch, that actually hurt' and 'I know you're joking, but that didn't feel very funny to me')",
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so rough!' and acknowledgment of the confusing 'am I being too sensitive?' feeling"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could briefly acknowledge that confronting a friend feels scary or awkward before jumping to the advice",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - a softener like 'If you want my take...' or 'I know it's hard, but...' could smooth it"

      "Add a brief acknowledgment that speaking up to friends is scary ('I know it's super awkward to call someone out, but...') to validate the emotional difficulty of the advice given",
      "Consider offering a lower-stakes alternative for teens not ready to confront directly yet, such as pulling the friend aside later or testing the waters with a smaller boundary"
