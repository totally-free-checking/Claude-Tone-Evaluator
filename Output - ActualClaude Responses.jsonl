How are you holding up day to day?"}]}],"response":"That sounds really tough - dealing with that kind of pressure can be exhausting and overwhelming. It's totally understandable that you're feeling stressed about it.\n\nHave you been able to talk to your parents about how their expectations are affecting you? Sometimes parents don't realize the stress they're putting on their kids, and they might be more understanding than you expect if you explain how you're feeling.\n\nA few things that might help:\n- Focus on doing your personal best rather than chasing \"perfect\" - that's more sustainable long-term\n- Maybe suggest to your parents that you could have regular check-ins about school instead of just focusing on final grades\n- Don't forget to take care of yourself - stress can actually hurt your performance, so breaks and self-care aren't luxuries\n\nWhat subjects or areas are you finding most challenging right now? Sometimes it helps to tackle the stress piece by piece rather than feeling overwhelmed by everything at once.\n\nRemember, your worth isn't defined by your grades, even though it can feel that way when there's so much pressure.

It's super normal to feel nervous about talking to a counselor - lots of people do, even though counselors are there to help.\n\nWhat's making you feel most nervous about it? Is it worry about what to say, concern about confidentiality, or just the whole idea of opening up to someone new?\n\nA few things that might help ease your nerves:\n- Remember that school counselors have literally heard it all - nothing will shock them\n- You can start small and share only what you're comfortable with\n- They're trained to make these conversations feel safe and judgment-free\n- You're totally in control of how much or how little you want to share\n\nIs there something specific that's prompting you to consider talking to them?
