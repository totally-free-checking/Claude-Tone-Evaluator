I can help you figure out what to say next."}]}],"response":"When someone tells you they’re struggling, the most helpful thing you can do usually isn’t to “fix it,” but to stay close, take them seriously, and help them feel less alone while they get the right support.\n\nA good place to start is simply making space for them to talk. You can say something like: “I’m really glad you told me. I’m here with you. Do you want to tell me what’s been going on?” If they share, aim for listening more than problem-solving—reflect back what you’re hearing (“That sounds exhausting” / “I can see why that would feel heavy”) and avoid rushing to silver linings.\n\nIt also helps to ask one straightforward question that gives them control: “What would feel most helpful right now—do you want advice, distraction, or just someone to listen?” People often don’t know what to ask for, so offering a few options can make it easier.\n\nIf what they’re describing sounds serious or ongoing, gently encourage additional support without making it feel like you’re passing them off: “I care about you a lot, and this sounds like more than you should have to carry alone. Would you be open to talking to a counselor/doctor? If you want, I can help you find someone or sit with you while you make the call.” Practical help (looking up resources, offering a ride, helping draft a message) can make a big difference.\n\nOne important piece: if there’s any chance they might hurt themselves, it’s okay—and responsible—to ask directly. You can say, calmly: “Sometimes when people feel this bad, they think about hurting themselves. Is that happening for you?” If they say yes, or you’re not sure they’re safe, don’t stay alone with it—seek immediate help. In the US/Canada you can call or text **988**; in the UK & ROI, Samaritans are at **116 123**; if you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll find the right number. If they’re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.\n\nYou can also set gentle boundaries for yourself. It’s okay to say: “I’m here for you, and I’m not a professional—can we get you more support too?” Being a steady friend is valuable; being their only lifeline is too much for one person.\n\nIf you want, tell me a little bit about what they said they’re struggling with (even broadly), and whether you’re worried about their immediate safety. I can help you figure out what to say next.","ground_truth":"That's really caring of you to want to help your friend. It can feel overwhelming when someone you care about is going through a tough time and you're not sure what to do.\n\nHere are some gentle ways you might be able to support them:\n\n**Simple but meaningful things:**\n- Just listen without trying to \"fix\" everything\n- Check in regularly with a text or call\n- Let them know you're there for them, no judgment\n- Ask \"How can I best support you right now?\"\n\n**Practical support:**\n- Offer specific help like bringing food, running errands, or just hanging out\n- Invite them to do low-key activities together\n- Give them space if they need it, but don't disappear completely\n\n**If it seems serious:**\n- Gently suggest they talk to a counselor, therapist, or trusted adult\n- Help them find resources if they're open to it\n- Don't feel like you have to carry all the weight yourself\n\nSometimes just knowing someone cares and is willing to stick around makes a huge difference. You don't have to have all the answers - being a consistent, caring presence is often enough.\n\nWhat kind of struggles are they dealing with, if you're comfortable sharing?

People remember kindness and steadiness way more than perfect moves.\n\nGive yourself a script.
