    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific phrases the teen can actually use: 'I know you meant well, but I need you to ask me before signing me up for things' - this is concrete and actionable",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and helpful: 'tell me what she signed you up for (and roughly your age), and I can help you craft a message' - shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
      "Good acknowledgment of parent intentions: 'A lot of parents do this thinking they're being helpful' - validates both perspectives",
      "Offers multiple pathways based on the teen's openness to the activity, showing flexibility and respect for their agency"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Jumps almost immediately into advice mode without sufficient emotional validation - Claude starts with 'Oh no, that sounds really frustrating!' and sits with the feeling first, while this response moves quickly to solutions",
      "Uses em-dashes and structured formatting that feels more formal than Claude's natural prose style",
      "Completely lacks emojis - Claude uses them to set a warm, casual tone (😅 or similar), making this feel more clinical by comparison",
      "The phrase 'without turning it into a huge fight' assumes conflict that the teen didn't mention, which could feel presumptuous rather than validating"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question asking for specifics (what she signed them up for and their age) to help craft a message - this perfectly matches Claude's approach of continuing the conversation with genuine, practical interest",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the immediate pivot to structured advice without sitting with the emotional frustration first - Claude would start with warmth and validation ('Oh no!', 'totally understandable') before offering solutions",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While there are no explicit bullet points, the response uses structured formatting with em-dashes and quoted phrases that create a more formal, segmented feel rather than Claude's flowing conversational paragraphs. The multiple 'If you...' conditional statements create an implicit list structure even without bullets."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude starts with emotional validation ('Oh no, that sounds really frustrating!') and sits with the feeling before offering advice, while the evaluated response validates but immediately moves to boundary-setting strategies",
      "Claude uses an emoji and more casual interjections ('Oh no') to create warmth, while the evaluated response is emoji-free and more formal in tone",
      "Claude asks simple, open questions first ('What did she sign you up for? And have you had a chance to talk to her about it yet?') to understand the situation, while the evaluated response assumes the teen wants advice on how to confront their mom",
      "Claude's response is shorter and more focused on understanding before advising, while the evaluated response provides comprehensive advice upfront that may feel overwhelming without first establishing what the teen actually needs"
