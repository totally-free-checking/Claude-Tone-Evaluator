    "strengths": [
      "Strong practical advice with specific phrases the teen could actually use ('Sorry about the other day — total autopilot moment')",
      "Good conversational tone in places ('Like, happens-to-everyone-eventually common', 'Your brain just grabbed the closest authority/caretaker label')",
      "Realistic reassurance about how quickly embarrassment fades",
      "Appropriate length - not too long or short"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bullet points (3 bullet items) completely breaks from Claude's prose-based approach - this is the biggest divergence",
      "Only one emoji in entire response (😅 is missing, no 💪), feels more formal/clinical",
      "Opens with validation but it's brief and quickly moves to solutions - doesn't sit with the feeling long enough",
      "The follow-up question shifts to checking for crisis ('genuinely unsafe/overwhelmed') which feels more clinical than Claude's natural conversational engagement"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is excellent - specific phrases like 'Sorry about the other day — total autopilot moment' and 'Yep, my brain short-circuited' are exactly the kind of actionable, realistic suggestions Claude would give",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed structure with bold headers ('**Do nothing:**', '**Quick one-liner:**', '**If they teased you:**') is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose flow. Claude would weave these options into conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response is structured as: brief intro paragraph, then 3 bullet points with bold headers, then closing paragraph. This is exactly the format Claude avoids. The advice itself is good but the presentation is too structured/list-like. Claude would say something like 'You could just do nothing - your teacher probably forgot in 30 seconds. Or if you want, next time you see them you could just say...' - all flowing naturally in prose."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses 2 emojis naturally (😅, 💪), evaluated response uses 0 - much colder feeling",
      "Ground truth is pure prose with natural flow, evaluated response breaks into bullet points with bold formatting",
      "Ground truth sits with the embarrassment longer ('Oh noooo!', 'wanting to just melt into the floor', 'classic school nightmare') before offering solutions, evaluated response moves quickly to advice",
      "Ground truth's follow-up question is casual and conversational ('Did your teacher react, or did you manage to just keep going?'), evaluated response's question shifts to crisis assessment ('genuinely unsafe/overwhelmed') which feels more like a counselor than a friend",
      "Ground truth emphasizes the emotional journey ('you'll probably even be able to laugh about it', 'you're gonna survive this one!'), evaluated response is more matter-of-fact about the embarrassment fading"
