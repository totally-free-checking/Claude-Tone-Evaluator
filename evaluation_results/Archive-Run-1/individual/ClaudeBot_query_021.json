    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice quality - very specific, actionable steps like 'ask in writing, calmly and clearly' and 'look for report reasons like harassment, bullying, privacy violation'",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and helpful: 'If you tell me what platform it's on and what country/state you're in, I can point you to the most relevant reporting route' - shows genuine interest in continuing to help"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with legal/technical analysis ('In most places, taking a photo of someone in a public setting is often legal, but posting it can still cross lines...') instead of emotional validation - jumps straight into problem-solving mode",
      "Heavy use of bullet-like structure with 'First, if it feels safe...' 'If they won't...' 'Also document...' 'If this is someone...' - reads like a structured guide rather than conversational prose",
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes the response feel formal and cold despite the serious topic",
      "Way too long and overwhelming (7 paragraphs) - would be difficult to read on a phone and feels more like a legal guide than a supportive conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is genuinely helpful and specific, showing real interest in providing tailored support based on the teen's actual situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The immediate jump into legal/technical analysis ('In most places, taking a photo of someone in a public setting is often legal...') completely bypasses emotional validation and sets a formal, informational tone rather than a warm, supportive one",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points are used, the response has a heavily structured, list-like quality with sequential 'First...If they won't...Also...If this is...' construction that reads like a formatted guide. The Ground Truth uses actual bullet points but maintains warmth through its opening and closing. This response avoids bullets but still feels over-structured and procedural."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth opens with strong emotional validation ('That's really frustrating and uncomfortable - I'm sorry that happened to you. Having your photo taken and shared without permission can feel like a real violation of your privacy') while the evaluated response opens with legal analysis",
      "Ground Truth uses emojis naturally in the bullet points to maintain warmth; evaluated response has zero emojis making it feel cold",
      "Ground Truth is concise (4 short paragraphs with bullets) and scannable; evaluated response is overwhelming (7 dense paragraphs)",
      "Ground Truth balances validation + practical advice + re-engagement; evaluated response is 90% practical advice with minimal emotional support",
      "Ground Truth's follow-up questions are warm and conversational ('How are you feeling about it?'); evaluated response's question is purely functional/informational"
