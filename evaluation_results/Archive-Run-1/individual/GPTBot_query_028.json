    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable - the suggested repair message ('Hey— I'm realizing what I said could've come off rude...') is specific and genuinely helpful",
      "Shows willingness to help further ('I can help you rewrite a message that fits your style') which demonstrates ongoing support"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emotional validation - jumps straight to diagnostic questions without acknowledging the teen's feelings ('Oh no, that feeling is the worst!' vs 'Totally happens')",
      "Heavy bullet point formatting (3 bullet points) instead of conversational prose - reads like a troubleshooting checklist rather than a supportive conversation",
      "No emojis at all - makes the response feel cold and formal compared to Claude's warm, casual approach",
      "Opens with 'Totally happens' which is dismissive rather than validating - minimizes the teen's distress instead of acknowledging it"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The specific repair message template is exactly the kind of concrete, actionable advice Claude would give - it's realistic, immediately usable, and shows understanding of teen communication",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed diagnostic questions at the start - this is the opposite of Claude's prose-based, emotionally validating approach. Claude asks questions naturally within conversation, not as a formatted list",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth opens with strong emotional validation ('Oh no, that feeling is the worst!') while evaluated response opens with dismissive minimization ('Totally happens')",
      "Ground truth uses conversational prose throughout; evaluated response uses bullet-pointed list format for questions",
      "Ground truth includes emoji (implied warm tone) and empathetic language ('really sweet'); evaluated response has no emojis and feels clinical",
      "Ground truth asks questions naturally within conversation flow; evaluated response presents questions as a diagnostic checklist",
      "Ground truth balances validation with curiosity; evaluated response jumps straight to problem-solving mode"
