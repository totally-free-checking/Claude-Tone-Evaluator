      "Perfect immediate validation with 'That sounds really frustrating!' - acknowledges feelings right away before offering any solutions",
      "Excellent prose structure throughout - zero bullet points, natural conversational flow in all four paragraphs",
      "Provides specific, actionable dialogue ('I've noticed things feel more strict lately - is there something specific you're worried about?') that teens can actually use",
      "Ends with two natural, engaging questions that invite continued conversation and show genuine interest in the specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing emoji usage - Claude's character typically includes 1-2 emojis (often 😅 or similar) to enhance the warm, casual tone, particularly in the opening",
      "Could potentially benefit from one supportive emoji in the first paragraph to fully match Claude's typical warmth markers"

      "The response is actually identical to the ground truth - this IS Claude's response, so the only 'difference' is that it lacks emojis that Claude sometimes includes but didn't in this particular instance"
