    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' - captures the frustration authentically and validates emotions right away",
      "Natural conversational flow with phrases like 'if you don't mind me asking' and 'once things cool down a bit' that feel genuinely supportive",
      "Excellent balance of empathy ('your feelings about it are still totally valid') with practical thinking ('is there maybe a way to talk it out')",
      "Ends with two natural follow-up questions that show genuine interest and invite continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could have included one emoji (like 😅) to add that extra warmth Claude typically uses, though the absence doesn't significantly detract from the overall tone"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate emotional validation followed by gentle inquiry ('What happened, if you don't mind me asking?') perfectly captures Claude's approach of validating first, then exploring the situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The lack of emoji is the only minor deviation - Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis, often in the opening to set a warm tone",
