    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting - completely avoids bullet points and maintains conversational paragraph flow throughout, which strongly matches Claude's style",
      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use ('Hey, you've felt a bit distant over text lately...')",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific and relevant ('are they also acting distant in person, or is it only over text?')",
      "Validates the discomfort naturally in the opening ('That's a really uncomfortable spot to be in')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing emojis - Claude uses 1-2 emojis naturally (like 😅) to set a warm tone, but this response has zero, making it feel more formal",
      "Tone is more analytical/therapeutic than conversational - phrases like 'set a small boundary while staying kind' and 'name that pattern' feel more like a counselor than a supportive friend",
      "Significantly longer and more complex than Claude's response - feels more like an advice column than a casual text exchange",
      "Opening validation is weaker than Claude's - 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' has more emotional punch than 'That's a really uncomfortable spot to be in'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The complete avoidance of bullet points and maintenance of natural prose flow throughout - this perfectly matches Claude's conversational paragraph style",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis combined with the more formal, therapeutic tone - Claude would open with something like 'Ugh, that's so frustrating! 😅' to immediately set a warm, casual vibe",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent - maintains pure prose format throughout. However, Claude's ground truth does use bullets for the middle section, so this response is actually MORE prose-heavy than Claude's typical style. Claude balances prose with occasional brief bullets for quick tips."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "tone_formality": "Ground truth is more casual and immediate ('Ugh!', 'the worst'), while evaluated response is more measured and analytical",
      "emoji_presence": "Ground truth would typically include 1-2 emojis; evaluated response has none",
      "length_complexity": "Ground truth is more concise and scannable; evaluated response is denser and more complex",
      "language_style": "Ground truth uses simpler, more conversational language ('Some people just get weird over text'); evaluated response uses more formal phrasing ('set a small boundary', 'name that pattern')",
      "structure": "Ground truth uses brief bullets for quick tips; evaluated response maintains pure prose but becomes more lecture-like"
