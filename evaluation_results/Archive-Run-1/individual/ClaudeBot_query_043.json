    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable scripts that are realistic and nuanced ('I'm trying to understand what's true' rather than 'caught you')",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and helpful ('If you tell me what kind of lie you suspect... I can help you tailor the wording')",
      "Good conversational tone in places ('That's a really uncomfortable spot to be in', 'it can sound like an accusation')",
      "Sophisticated advice about reading the friend's response ('whether they can engage calmly with specifics... whether they turn it into attacking you')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bullet points and structured formatting (multiple script examples with quotes, 'Two things to watch for:') - this is the biggest divergence from Claude's prose-heavy style",
      "Complete absence of emojis - makes it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's approach",
      "Too long and dense - feels more like a comprehensive guide than a supportive conversation (7 paragraphs with multiple scripts)",
      "Validation is present but brief - jumps quickly into solutions without spending enough time on emotional acknowledgment"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is exceptional - the scripts are specific, realistic, and show deep understanding of teen social dynamics. The phrase 'I'm trying to understand what's true' rather than 'caught you' is exactly the kind of nuanced guidance Claude would give.",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy reliance on bullet-point-style script examples and structured formatting ('If you think they'll get defensive...', 'Two things to watch for:') reads more like a comprehensive advice article than Claude's natural, flowing prose style.",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points are used, the response uses bullet-point-like structure through multiple quoted script examples and sectioned advice ('If you think they'll get defensive...', 'If they deny it...', 'Two things to watch for:'). This creates a similar effect to bullet points - it's structured and organized rather than flowing naturally. Claude's ground truth uses actual bullets but integrates them more naturally into conversational flow."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Length and density: Ground truth is 4 concise paragraphs; evaluated response is 7 longer paragraphs with multiple detailed scripts, making it feel more overwhelming",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth has no emojis either (unusual for Claude), but combined with other factors, the evaluated response feels more formal overall",
      "Structure: Ground truth uses labeled bullets (**The soft opener:**) but keeps them brief and conversational; evaluated response uses prose but structures it like sections of an article",
      "Validation ratio: Ground truth spends more time on emotional validation ('The uncertainty can feel worse than knowing for sure', 'good friends should be able to have these conversations'); evaluated response validates briefly then dives deep into solutions",
      "Tone of advice: Ground truth keeps scripts shorter and simpler; evaluated response provides more comprehensive, detailed scripts that feel more adult-oriented"
