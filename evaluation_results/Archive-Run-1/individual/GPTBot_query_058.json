      "Excellent practical advice with specific scripts teens can actually use ('I'm nervous to talk about this, but I think I need help') - very actionable and realistic",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers (###), bullet points, and bold text throughout - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation. Ground truth uses prose with minimal bullets.",
      "Missing emojis entirely - makes it feel formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm, casual tone",
      "Jumps too quickly into advice mode without sufficient emotional validation upfront - Ground truth starts with 'I totally get that!' and validates the nervousness before offering solutions",
      "Too long and overwhelming (6 major sections with multiple subsections) - Ground truth is more concise and digestible"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The specific conversation scripts ('I'm nervous to talk about this, but I think I need help') are exactly the kind of practical, immediately usable advice Claude would give",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of headers, bullet points, and formatting makes it read like a structured guide rather than a supportive conversation - completely opposite to Claude's prose-based approach",
