    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting - entirely paragraph-based with natural flow, no bullet points or lists, which matches Claude's style perfectly",
      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable suggestions like the exact wording for approaching the teacher ('I feel like I'm not doing well in this class...')",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific and invites continued conversation ('What's the main thing they do that gives you that impression?')",
      "Realistic and nuanced advice that acknowledges multiple possibilities without being dismissive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing emoji entirely - Claude uses 1-2 emojis (like 😔) to set a warm tone early, this response feels more formal without them",
      "Jumps too quickly into problem-solving mode - opens with validation but immediately pivots to 'The key is figuring out which it is' rather than sitting with the feeling longer",
      "Slightly more clinical/analytical tone ('get concrete', 'test whether there's a pattern') compared to Claude's warmer, more conversational approach",
      "The opening validation is brief compared to Claude's more extended empathetic acknowledgment ('Oh no, that sounds really tough to deal with!')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The pure prose formatting and natural paragraph flow - no bullets, no headers, advice woven naturally into conversational paragraphs exactly as Claude does",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the relatively quick pivot from emotional validation to analytical problem-solving, making it feel slightly more like a guidance counselor than a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting throughout. All advice flows naturally within paragraphs rather than being listed. This is exactly Claude's approach and a major strength of this response."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "emotional_opening": "Claude: 'Oh no, that sounds really tough to deal with! 😔' - more emphatic and warm. Evaluated: 'That's a really unpleasant feeling' - more measured and clinical",
      "emoji_presence": "Claude uses 😔 early to set warm tone. Evaluated response has zero emojis, making it feel more formal",
      "validation_depth": "Claude spends more time on emotional validation ('It's never fun feeling like someone important in your life might not like you') before moving to analysis. Evaluated response validates briefly then quickly moves to problem-solving",
      "tone_warmth": "Claude uses more casual, empathetic language ('Oh no', 'our brains can play tricks on us'). Evaluated response is slightly more analytical ('get concrete', 'test whether there's a pattern')",
      "structure": "Claude presents possibilities in a casual bulleted format within prose. Evaluated response keeps everything in pure prose (actually better matches the no-bullets guideline)"
