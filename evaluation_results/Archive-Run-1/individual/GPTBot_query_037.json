      "Strong opening validation: 'That's a really crappy feeling' immediately acknowledges the emotional impact",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable, offering concrete phrases like 'Hey, I overheard my name earlier—was there something you wanted to tell me?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with multiple lists and bold headers (e.g., '**What did you actually hear?**', '**Direct but calm:**') - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "Jumps almost immediately to problem-solving mode without sufficient emotional sitting-with-the-feeling that Claude provides",
      "No emojis at all, making it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's natural emoji usage",
      "The follow-up question feels transactional ('If you tell me where this happened...') rather than emotionally engaged like Claude's 'Want to talk through what happened?'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening line 'That's a really crappy feeling' captures Claude's immediate validation and casual, empathetic tone perfectly",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bullet points, bold headers, and structured formatting reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",

      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by bullet-pointed lists with bold headers. Has three separate bulleted sections: initial questions, response options, and documentation advice. Only the first and last paragraphs are in prose form. This is the complete opposite of Claude's prose-heavy, conversational approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude uses pure prose with natural flow; evaluated response is 75% bullets and formatted lists",
      "Claude focuses on emotional exploration first ('How are you feeling about it?', 'Want to talk through what happened?'); evaluated response quickly pivots to analytical problem-solving",
      "Claude uses an emoji (implied warm tone) and keeps it conversational; evaluated response has no emojis and feels more instructional",
      "Claude's follow-up is open and inviting; evaluated response's follow-up is conditional and information-gathering ('If you tell me...')",
      "Claude sits with the uncertainty and validates the wondering; evaluated response immediately tries to categorize and solve"
