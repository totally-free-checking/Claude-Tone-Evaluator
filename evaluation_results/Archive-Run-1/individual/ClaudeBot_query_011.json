    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific script: 'I've noticed you've been doing a lot of the same things I do...' - this is concrete and immediately actionable",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and relevant: 'What kinds of things are they copying—your style/interests, your plans, or more personal stuff...' - shows genuine interest and invites deeper conversation",
      "Good acknowledgment of the emotional impact: 'it's starting to feel intrusive or like your choices aren't \"yours\" anymore' - validates the feeling of loss of identity"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses em-dashes and parenthetical asides excessively (clothes/hobbies/phrases/whatever, style/interests, etc.) which creates a more formal, structured feel rather than natural conversation flow",
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's approach which uses 😅 or similar to set a casual tone",
      "Too solution-heavy too quickly - jumps into 'If you want the cleanest way through it' without enough emotional validation first. Claude spends more time in the empathy space before offering solutions",
      "The phrase 'cleanest way through it' and 'low-drama conversation' feels slightly clinical/adult-oriented rather than teen-casual"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is excellent - specific, engaging, and naturally continues the conversation by asking about the exact nature of the copying",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the overly structured, advice-heavy approach with minimal warmth upfront. Claude leads with validation ('Ugh, that sounds really frustrating!') while this response leads with analysis",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While there are no actual bullet points, the response uses heavy em-dash formatting and parenthetical lists (clothes/hobbies/phrases, style/interests/plans) that create a quasi-structured feel. The prose is dense and advice-focused rather than conversational and flowing."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "opening_tone": "Claude opens with 'Ugh, that sounds really frustrating!' with immediate empathy. Evaluated response opens with 'That sounds really irritating' which is more measured and analytical",
      "emoji_presence": "Claude uses natural emojis to set warm tone; evaluated response has none",
      "validation_to_advice_ratio": "Claude spends 2 paragraphs on validation/exploration before gently suggesting conversation. Evaluated response quickly moves to 'If you want the cleanest way through it' after brief validation",
      "language_style": "Claude uses casual phrases like 'your own thing', 'jumping on it', 'pretty suffocating'. Evaluated response uses more formal constructions like 'the cleanest way through it', 'reduce defensiveness', 'tighten the boundary'",
      "length": "Evaluated response is significantly longer (5 paragraphs vs 3), which makes it feel more like an advice article than a supportive conversation"
