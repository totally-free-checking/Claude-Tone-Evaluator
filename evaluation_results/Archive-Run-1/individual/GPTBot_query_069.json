      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable steps like 'I don't like that. Stop.' and concrete boundary-setting language",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers, bold text, and bullet points throughout - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation (e.g., '### How to tell: teasing vs. bullying', numbered steps)",
      "Completely lacks emotional validation at the start - jumps straight into definitions and advice without acknowledging the teen's confusion or feelings",
      "Zero emojis - feels formal and clinical rather than warm and conversational",
      "The tone is more instructional/educational than supportive - uses phrases like 'A good rule of thumb is' and 'How to tell' which feel like a textbook"

    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end are specific, natural, and show genuine interest in understanding the situation better",

      "Ground truth starts with immediate emotional validation ('That sounds really frustrating and confusing!') while evaluated response jumps straight to definitions",
      "Ground truth uses minimal formatting (just two simple bullet sections within prose) while evaluated response has multiple headers, bold text, numbered lists, and extensive bullets",
      "Ground truth has warm, conversational tone with emoji (😊 implied in tone) while evaluated response is clinical and formal with zero emojis",
      "Ground truth balances validation and advice naturally in prose; evaluated response is structured like an educational guide with sections and subsections",
      "Ground truth ends with one natural question; evaluated response has multiple bullet-pointed questions that feel more like an intake form"
