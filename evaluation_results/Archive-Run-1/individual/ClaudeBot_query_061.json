    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting - maintains conversational paragraphs throughout with zero bullet points, matching Claude's natural flow style",
      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable examples ('do they choose you when they don't have to?', 'grab coffee with me this weekend') that are realistic for teens",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific and invites more detail ('are you friends, coworkers/classmates, or mostly texting')",
      "Sophisticated insight about feelings ('pay attention to how you feel after interactions') that treats the teen as capable of self-reflection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's character, which uses 1-2 emojis naturally (Claude used 'Ah, the classic \"do they or don't they\" situation!')",
      "Jumps too quickly into analytical advice mode without enough initial emotional validation - Claude starts with 'That uncertain territory can be both exciting and nerve-wracking' while this response immediately goes into problem-solving",
      "Tone is slightly more clinical/analytical ('your brain keeps trying to solve it with incomplete data', 'useful information') rather than purely conversational and warm",
      "Opening line, while clever, feels more intellectual than emotionally validating compared to Claude's immediate acknowledgment of the emotional experience"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose-heavy formatting and natural paragraph flow perfectly matches Claude's style - no bullets, no headers, just conversational paragraphs that read like a real conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the immediate dive into analytical advice without sufficient warm emotional validation at the start - Claude always leads with feelings acknowledgment before solutions",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow. No bullets, headers, or over-structuring. This is exactly how Claude writes - conversational paragraphs that flow naturally."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude uses an emoji and more playful language ('Ah, the classic...!') while the evaluated response is more analytical from the start",
      "Claude validates the emotional experience first ('exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time') before any advice, while the evaluated response leads with intellectual framing ('your brain keeps trying to solve it')",
      "Claude's tone is warmer and more reassuring throughout ('It's totally normal', 'And hey, no pressure') while the evaluated response is more instructional and analytical",
      "Claude asks open-ended questions about their experience first ('Are you picking up on any particular signals?') while the evaluated response gives extensive advice before asking for context",
      "Missing the emoji that Claude naturally includes to set a warm, casual tone"
