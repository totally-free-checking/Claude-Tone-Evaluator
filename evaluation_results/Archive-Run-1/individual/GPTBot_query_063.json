      "Strong practical advice with specific phrases ('Sorry—wrong room,' 'Is this ___?') that are realistic and immediately actionable for teens",
      "Good follow-up question at the end ('tell me—was it a lecture, a small class, or like an exam setting?') that shows genuine interest and invites continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bullet points (3 bullet items) completely breaks from Claude's prose-based conversational style. Ground truth uses pure prose paragraphs, while this response reads like a checklist",
      "Missing emojis entirely - Claude uses 😅 naturally in the ground truth to set a warm, casual tone. This response feels more formal and less friendly without any emoji usage",
      "Jumps too quickly into solutions ('here are a few low-drama saves:') without enough emotional validation first. Claude spends more time acknowledging the feeling and normalizing the experience before offering advice",
      "The opening validation ('Oof, that's a painfully relatable moment') is good but brief - Claude extends the validation much longer ('that moment when you realize... feel like you're under a spotlight')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question asking about the specific context (lecture vs. small class vs. exam) is very Claude-like - it's specific, shows genuine interest, and naturally continues the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed list format ('here are a few low-drama saves:' followed by three bullet points) is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose style. Claude would weave these suggestions into conversational paragraphs",

      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response has a clear structure break with 'here are a few low-drama saves:' followed by three bulleted scenarios. This is exactly what Claude avoids - the ground truth has zero bullets and flows as natural conversation. The bullets make it read like a how-to guide rather than a supportive chat"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Format: Ground truth is 2 pure prose paragraphs; evaluated response uses bullet points for advice delivery",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth uses 😅 naturally; evaluated response has zero emojis",
      "Validation depth: Ground truth spends entire first paragraph on validation and normalization; evaluated response gives one sentence before pivoting to solutions",
      "Tone: Ground truth asks playful questions about their reaction ('Did you do the classic act like you're looking for someone move?'); evaluated response is more instructional",
      "Balance: Ground truth is roughly 60% validation/40% advice; evaluated response is roughly 20% validation/80% advice"
