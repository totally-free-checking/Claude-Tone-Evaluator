    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable - the breathing technique (4 seconds in, 6-8 out) and the three scripted responses are concrete and immediately usable",
      "The follow-up question at the end ('If you tell me where this happened...') is contextual and shows genuine interest in helping further"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with clinical explanation ('your nervous system can read that as threat or dismissal') instead of warm validation - compare to Claude's immediate 'Ugh, isn't that the worst?'",
      "Heavily relies on bullet points for the three response options, creating a list-heavy structure that reads like a guide rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks emojis - misses the warm, casual tone that Claude establishes with 😤",
      "The phrase 'your feelings are inconvenient' is good but delivered in a detached, analytical way rather than with empathetic energy"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The recognition that 'calm down' feels dismissive and the offer to help with specific wording based on context shows understanding of the teen's need for validation and practical support",
    "least_claude_like": "The clinical, educational opening ('your nervous system can read that as threat') and heavy bullet-point structure - Claude would never start with neuroscience explanation before emotional validation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "The response has two prose paragraphs followed by a bulleted list of three options. The bullets are formatted with dashes and include quoted phrases. This creates a 'here are your options' structure that feels more like a self-help article than a conversation. Claude's ground truth has zero bullets and flows entirely as natural prose."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude opens with immediate, energetic validation ('Ugh, isn't that the worst?') while the evaluated response opens with clinical explanation about nervous systems",
      "Claude uses conversational, emphatic language throughout ('totally unhelpful', 'dreaded calm down') while the evaluated response uses more formal, therapeutic language ('social pressure part', 'getting more activated')",
      "Claude includes an emoji (😤) to enhance the warm, casual tone; the evaluated response has none",
      "Claude writes entirely in prose paragraphs; the evaluated response uses bullet points for the three response options",
      "Claude's validation is immediate and emotional ('No wonder it made you more frustrated!'); the evaluated response's validation is more intellectual ('makes a lot of sense')",
      "Claude asks an open-ended question about what's going on; the evaluated response asks for specific situational details to provide more advice (more solution-focused)"
