    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That sounds really frustrating and confusing!' immediately acknowledges the emotional difficulty",
      "Excellent follow-up question: 'What's your sense of it - does it feel more playful or more hurtful to you?' is natural, specific, and invites continued conversation",
      "Good practical framework that helps the teen self-assess their situation with concrete indicators",
      "Empowering language: 'Trust your gut feeling here - if it doesn't feel good to you, that matters regardless of their intentions' validates the teen's own judgment"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy bullet point formatting with bold headers ('**It might be moving toward bullying if:**') - this is the opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "Complete absence of emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical style",
      "The entire middle section is structured as two bullet-pointed lists, which reads like a checklist rather than a conversation",
      "While conversational in parts, the heavy formatting makes it feel more like an article or guide than a supportive chat"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is perfectly Claude-like - natural, specific to their situation, and genuinely interested in continuing the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bold headers and bullet points throughout the response - Claude would integrate this same advice into flowing paragraphs rather than presenting it as formatted lists",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 10,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "The response has two major bullet-pointed sections with bold headers, comprising about 70% of the content. Only the opening, closing, and transitional sentences are in prose form. This is a significant departure from Claude's prose-heavy style."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Ground truth and evaluated response are identical, which means the ground truth itself contains heavy bullet formatting - this appears to be an earlier version of Claude's character or a different context",
      "emoji_usage": "No emojis in either response, though current Claude character typically includes 1-2",
      "structure": "Both responses use the same bullet-heavy structure with bold headers"
