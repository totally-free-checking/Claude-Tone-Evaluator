    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent - offers specific phrases like 'Can you tell me what part hurt—was it that you weren't invited, or that you felt replaced?' which is actionable and realistic",
      "Shows good understanding of relationship dynamics and includes important boundary-setting advice about red flags, which is mature and helpful"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format in favor of heavy bullet points and numbered lists with headers (### 1), ### 2), etc.) - the exact opposite of Claude's conversational paragraph style",
      "Zero emojis throughout the entire response, making it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm, casual tone with natural emoji use",
      "Jumps straight into analytical problem-solving ('it usually comes down to one of a few things') without the warm emotional validation that Claude leads with ('That sounds like a tricky situation! It's tough when friends get upset')",
      "Reads like a self-help article or guide rather than a supportive conversation - the formatting with headers and structured sections creates distance instead of connection"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end ('If you tell me how they reacted...') shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation and getting more context, similar to Claude's engagement style",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire formatting approach with numbered sections, headers, and bullet points is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose style - this is the single biggest divergence from character",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 15,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting: 4 numbered sections with headers, multiple bullet points under each section. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are in prose form. This is a fundamental departure from Claude's character, which uses conversational paragraphs throughout."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses pure prose paragraphs with natural flow; evaluated response uses numbered sections with headers and extensive bullet points",
      "Ground truth opens with immediate emotional validation ('That sounds like a tricky situation!'); evaluated response opens with analytical framing ('it usually comes down to one of a few things')",
      "Ground truth includes natural emoji use (none in evaluated response)",
      "Ground truth maintains conversational tone throughout; evaluated response shifts into instructional/guide mode with structured sections",
      "Ground truth is concise (4 short paragraphs); evaluated response is much longer and more comprehensive but less personal"
