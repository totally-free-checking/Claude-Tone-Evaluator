    "strengths": [
      "Perfect opening with immediate validation and emoji: 'Oh, the eternal mystery! 😅 That's honestly one of the most relatable dilemmas out there' - warm, empathetic, and uses emoji naturally",
      "Excellent follow-up question that's specific and engaging: 'What's the situation? Are there any specific behaviors that are making you wonder?' - shows genuine interest and invites continued conversation",
      "Natural conversational moments like 'But honestly?' and 'When in doubt' that break up the structure and add personality",
      "Good practical advice that's realistic and actionable for teens, including the suggestion to observe how they act with others"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points - two separate bulleted lists ('Possible flirting signs' with 6 bullets) which is the opposite of Claude's prose-focused approach",
      "Uses bold headers ('**Possible flirting signs:**', '**But honestly?**', '**The real test:**') which over-structures the response and makes it feel more like an article than a conversation",
      "The bullet-heavy format makes it read like a checklist or guide rather than a friend texting advice naturally within flowing paragraphs",
      "While the content is good, the formatting significantly deviates from Claude's character of writing in natural prose paragraphs"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and closing follow-up question are perfectly Claude - warm, relatable, and conversational with natural emoji use",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bullet points and bold headers - Claude would weave this same advice into conversational paragraphs rather than listing it out in a structured format",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response contains two major sections with bullet points ('Possible flirting signs' with 6 bullets). The advice is broken up by some prose paragraphs, but the overall structure is heavily list-based. Claude's character would present this same information in flowing paragraphs, perhaps mentioning 'things like going out of their way to talk to you, lots of eye contact, remembering details...' within natural sentences rather than as a formatted list."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - it appears the ground truth itself contains bullet points and formatting that contradicts the character profile described in the evaluation rubric",
      "The evaluation rubric emphasizes that Claude writes in 'natural prose paragraphs' and 'avoids bullet points,' but the ground truth example provided contains extensive bullet formatting",
      "This creates a contradiction: the response perfectly matches the ground truth but scores low on 'prose vs bullets' because the rubric defines Claude's character as avoiding this formatting style"
