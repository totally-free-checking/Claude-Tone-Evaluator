      "Excellent prose formatting - no bullet points, flows naturally in paragraphs throughout",
      "Strong practical advice with specific cognitive reframing ('separating what you actually know from what you're assuming')",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific to the situation and invites deeper sharing",
      "Validates that the feeling is normal and doesn't make them dumb"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing emojis - makes it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's approach (Ground Truth opens with 😕)",
      "Tone is more therapeutic/clinical than conversational ('cognitive reframing', 'interpretation', 'vulnerability') - sounds like a counselor rather than a supportive friend",
      "Opens with validation but it's more measured and intellectual rather than the immediate emotional warmth of 'Aw, that stings!'",
      "Lacks casual language and natural interjections that make Claude feel relatable ('lol', 'hits different', 'literally everyone with a pulse')"

    "most_claude_like": "The prose formatting is perfect - pure paragraphs with natural flow, exactly matching Claude's style of avoiding bullet points and maintaining conversational structure",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the therapeutic/clinical tone ('vulnerability', 'interpretation', 'cognitive reframing') makes it feel like talking to a counselor rather than a warm, casual teen support friend",

      "emoji_usage": "Ground Truth has 😕 early on to set warm tone vs Evaluated has zero emojis",
      "tone": "Ground Truth feels like texting a supportive friend vs Evaluated feels like a therapy session",
      "validation_style": "Ground Truth: 'You're not dumb at all. Having feelings and reactions just means you're human!' (simple, direct) vs Evaluated: 'having a crush always involves a bit of vulnerability; feeling exposed is part of it' (more analytical)"
