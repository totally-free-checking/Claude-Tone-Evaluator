    "strengths": [
      "Maintains prose format throughout with no bullet points, which aligns well with Claude's style",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice like 'have a couple of neutral scripts ready' with concrete examples ('Yeah, I felt like a change')",
      "Ends with an engaging follow-up question that's specific and offers continued support",
      "Shows psychological insight by breaking down different types of fears (mean comments vs. attention vs. being talked out of it)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis, making it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's approach (Ground truth uses emojis naturally)",
      "Opens with validation but it's more analytical than warm - 'really common' feels clinical compared to Claude's 'I totally get that feeling!'",
      "Tone is more therapeutic/coaching than conversational - phrases like 'useful way to separate it' and 'they call for slightly different tactics' sound professional rather than friend-like",
      "Lacks the immediate emotional warmth of Claude's response - doesn't use casual interjections like 'Here's the thing though' or 'honestly?'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose-heavy format and the specific, practical advice with example phrases ('Yeah, I felt like a change') matches Claude's approach of giving teens actual words they can use",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the analytical, therapeutic tone ('useful way to separate it', 'they call for slightly different tactics') makes it feel like a counselor rather than a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting with no bullets. However, the prose itself reads more like a therapy session than a casual conversation. Uses em-dashes and complex sentence structures that feel more formal than Claude's natural flow."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth opens with 'I totally get that feeling!' (immediate, warm validation) vs. 'really common' (more clinical observation)",
      "Ground truth uses emojis naturally; evaluated response has zero emojis",
      "Ground truth uses casual language ('Here's the thing though', 'honestly?', 'YOUR body and YOUR style!') vs. more formal phrasing ('useful way to separate it', 'they call for slightly different tactics')",
      "Ground truth has shorter, punchier paragraphs that feel more text-message-like; evaluated response has longer, denser paragraphs",
      "Ground truth emphasizes 'it's YOUR body' with empowering language; evaluated response focuses more on managing others' reactions",
      "Ground truth's follow-up is simpler and more direct ('What kind of change are you thinking about?'); evaluated response's follow-up is longer and more conditional"
