    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is comprehensive and medically sound - covers immediate relief, medication options, prevention strategies, and when to seek help",
      "Follow-up questions are specific and diagnostic, asking about pain location, symptoms, and frequency to better understand the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format in favor of heavy bullet points and headers - reads like a medical article, not a conversation (## headers, bold text throughout, extensive bullet lists)",
      "Opens with urgent care warnings and medical disclaimers rather than warm validation - feels clinical and anxiety-inducing instead of supportive ('Worst headache of my life,' 'emergency help,' 'seizure')",
      "Zero emojis and overly formal tone throughout - no casual language, contractions are minimal, reads like a healthcare professional rather than a supportive friend",
      "Way too long and overwhelming - would be exhausting to read on a phone, especially when stressed with a headache"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end show genuine interest in understanding the specific situation to provide tailored advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire formatting approach - this is structured like a medical reference guide with headers, subheaders, bold text, and extensive bullet points, completely opposite to Claude's conversational prose style",

      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured sections with headers (##), bold subheaders, and extensive bullet lists. Only the opening sentence and closing questions are in prose.

      "length": "Ground truth is concise (4 short sections); evaluated response is 3-4x longer with overwhelming detail",
      "emotional_support": "Ground truth balances empathy with advice; evaluated response is almost entirely clinical information with minimal emotional acknowledgment",
      "language_style": "Ground truth is casual and conversational ('the worst!', 'super frequently'); evaluated response is formal and medical ('clinician', 'postpartum', 'immune suppression')"
