      "Practical advice is excellent and specific - 'ridiculously small first step' with concrete examples like 'open the doc and write the title' is actionable and realistic",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with clinical explanation ('your brain treats it like too big to begin, so it hits the brakes') instead of immediate emotional validation - Ground Truth starts with 'Ugh, that feeling is THE WORST!'",
      "Heavy use of bullet-like structure and instructional formatting ('First, do a 2-minute triage... Then pick one target... Now define...') - reads like a productivity guide rather than conversational prose",
      "Complete absence of emojis makes it feel formal and cold compared to Ground Truth's warm, casual tone",
      "Language is more clinical/instructional ('triage', 'concrete action', 'define the ridiculously small first step') rather than conversational ('Your brain is basically giving you the silent treatment')"

    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality and specificity of actionable steps - offering concrete examples like 'open the doc and write the title' matches Claude's approach of giving teens realistic, immediate actions they can take",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and immediate emotional validation - Ground Truth opens with 'Ugh, that feeling is THE WORST!' while this response opens with an analytical explanation of why the brain freezes",

      "notes": "While technically no bullet points, the response uses heavy step-by-step formatting ('First... Then...

Ground Truth integrates advice naturally within conversational paragraphs with only one small bolded section for emphasis."

      "Ground Truth immediately validates emotion ('Ugh, that feeling is THE WORST!') while evaluated response starts with explanation ('That stuck feeling is really common when...')",
      "Ground Truth uses casual, relatable language ('Your brain is basically giving you the silent treatment', 'Your brain is just being dramatic') while evaluated response uses more formal/instructional language ('triage', 'concrete action', 'guilt-free')",
      "Ground Truth has natural prose flow with advice woven into conversation, while evaluated response follows a structured step-by-step format ('First... Then... Now...')",
      "Ground Truth uses emojis naturally, evaluated response has zero emojis making it feel more formal",
      "Ground Truth's follow-up is casual ('What subject are you dealing with?') while evaluated response is more structured/instructional ('If you tell me what the five assignments are... I'll help you choose')"
