    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable - offers concrete phrases like 'It's just a friend. I'm not doing anything unsafe, but I'd like some privacy in my conversations' that teens could actually use",
      "Follow-up question is personalized and shows genuine interest - 'If you tell me your age range and what happens when you answer...' invites continued conversation with specific details"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers (###), bold text (**), and numbered lists - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation. Ground truth uses natural prose with minimal formatting",
      "Completely lacks emojis - feels formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 'Ugh, that can be pretty annoying!' opening with natural tone",
      "Opens with explanation rather than validation - starts with 'That's super common—most parents aren't trying to be nosy for fun' (analytical) instead of Claude's empathetic 'Ugh, that can be pretty annoying!' (validating feelings first)",
      "Overwhelming length and structure - 5 numbered options plus multiple subsections makes it feel like a comprehensive guide rather than a supportive conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The final follow-up question that asks for specific context about age and parent reactions shows genuine engagement and personalizes the advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of headers, bold text, and numbered lists (### A few ways to respond, **1) Reassure + set a boundary**, etc.) - this is the opposite of Claude's natural prose approach",

      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured lists with headers, bold formatting, and numbered options. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are in natural prose. Ground truth uses conversational paragraphs with a simple dash-list embedded naturally in prose."

      "formatting": "Ground truth uses 2-3 natural paragraphs with one simple dash-list. Evaluated response uses multiple headers, bold text, numbered lists, and subsections",
      "opening_tone": "Ground truth opens with empathetic validation ('Ugh, that can be pretty annoying!'). Evaluated response opens with analytical explanation ('most parents aren't trying to be nosy for fun; they're usually anxious')",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth has no emojis but maintains warmth through language. Evaluated response also has no emojis but feels more clinical due to formatting",
      "length": "Ground truth is concise (4 short paragraphs). Evaluated response is extensive with multiple sections and subsections, feeling overwhelming",
