    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That really sucks' and the acknowledgment that it 'feels *way* louder in your head' shows genuine empathy",
      "Excellent practical advice quality with specific, actionable suggestions like exact phrases to text ('Hey, are you around for lunch?') and concrete actions (headphones, relocating)",
      "Good follow-up questions at the end that show genuine interest and invite continued conversation ('school or work?' 'is there anyone you *could* sit with but it feels awkward?')",
      "Includes helpful psychological insight about the 'spotlight effect' which is both validating and educational"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with 4 main bullet points and sub-bullets - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth has zero bullets, this response is dominated by them",
      "Uses bold formatting excessively (**today**, **Make it look intentional**, **Change the scene**, etc.) which feels like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Only uses italics for emphasis (*way*) - no emojis at all, making it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's natural emoji usage",
      "Jumps too quickly into solution mode - the validation is brief (one paragraph) before launching into a structured list of options, whereas Claude balances support throughout"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end are very Claude-like - specific, conversational, and genuinely interested in understanding more about the teen's situation to provide better help",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy bullet-point formatting with bold headers ('**Make it look intentional**', '**Change the scene**') reads like a structured guide or article rather than a warm, conversational text from a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response is approximately 70% bullet-pointed lists with bold headers and sub-bullets. Ground truth is 100% prose with natural paragraph flow. This is the most significant deviation from Claude's character - it reads like a formatted advice article rather than a casual conversation"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth uses 4 natural prose paragraphs; evaluated response uses 1 intro paragraph, then 4 bullet points with sub-bullets, then 1 closing paragraph",
      "Formatting: Ground truth has no bold text or bullets; evaluated response heavily uses bold headers and structured lists",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth has no emojis (appropriate for this serious topic); evaluated response also has none but uses italics instead",
      "Tone progression: Ground truth maintains conversational warmth throughout; evaluated response shifts from warm opening to structured/clinical advice section, then back to conversational",
      "Length: Evaluated response is significantly longer and more comprehensive, which could feel overwhelming rather than supportive"
