    "strengths": [
      "Strong prose formatting - maintains paragraph structure throughout with no bullet points, which matches Claude's style well",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable - the physiological sigh technique is concrete and the brain dump method includes clear steps ('write every thought fragment down as fast as you can')",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific to the situation ('is this mostly showing up at night/when you're trying to rest, or is it hitting you throughout the day too?')",
      "Validates the difficulty of 'stress for no reason' by explaining the physiological basis, which shows understanding"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes the response feel more clinical and less warm compared to Claude's casual, supportive tone",
      "Opening validation is weaker - 'That sounds really uncomfortable' is more formal than Claude's 'Oh man, that racing brain feeling is the worst!' which immediately connects",
      "Language is more clinical/educational ('nervous system stuck in a revved-up state', 'physiological sigh') rather than conversational - Claude uses simpler, more relatable language",
      "The crisis line addition at the end, while well-intentioned, feels somewhat out of place for this query and adds a more formal, cautious tone that Claude doesn't use for this level of concern"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose-based formatting and the specific, actionable breathing technique with clear instructions ('inhale gently through your nose, then take a quick second \"top-up\" sip of air')",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the more clinical, educational tone throughout - Claude would use warmer, more casual language like 'racing brain feeling' instead of 'nervous system stuck in a revved-up state'",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting with no bullet points. However, the Ground Truth actually uses bold headers with bullet points for the advice section, so this response is actually MORE prose-focused than Claude's actual response, which is interesting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Tone: Ground Truth opens with 'Oh man, that racing brain feeling is the worst!' (casual, empathetic) vs. 'That sounds really uncomfortable' (more formal, clinical)",
      "Language style: Ground Truth uses conversational phrases ('word-vomit', 'ping-ponging around', 'sounds silly but') while the evaluated response uses more technical language ('nervous system', 'physiological sigh', 'downshift signal')",
      "Emoji usage: Ground Truth has no emojis either (interesting - both responses lack them), but Ground Truth compensates with much warmer, more casual language",
      "Structure: Ground Truth actually uses bold headers and bullet points for advice, while evaluated response stays in pure prose - this is a reversal of what might be expected",
      "Crisis line mention: Evaluated response adds crisis resources which Ground Truth doesn't include for this level of concern, making it feel more cautious/formal"
