      "Opens with validation ('That sucks — and it's really frustrating') which acknowledges the teen's feelings",
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable, asking for specific details that would actually help assess the situation (witnesses, written documentation, appeal process)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (4 bullet points) completely diverges from Claude's prose-based conversational style - Ground Truth uses pure prose paragraphs",
      "Jumps too quickly into problem-solving mode with numbered steps '(1)' and '(2)' and multiple questions, lacking the extended emotional validation Claude provides",
      "No emoji usage at all, making it feel more formal and less warm compared to Claude's casual, supportive tone",
      "The multiple rapid-fire questions feel like an interrogation or intake form rather than a natural conversation - Ground Truth asks 2-3 questions naturally woven into prose"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation 'That sucks — and it's really frustrating when it feels unfair' captures Claude's immediate empathy and acknowledgment of feelings",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed list of questions with formal structure ('A few quick questions:' followed by 4 bullets) is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose style - Ground Truth weaves questions naturally into conversational paragraphs",

      "notes": "Response is heavily structured with bullets. Opens with 2 sentences of prose, then immediately shifts to numbered points (1) and (2), followed by 'A few quick questions:' and 4 bullet points, then ends with a final question. Ground Truth uses 0 bullets and maintains conversational prose throughout all 3 paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground Truth is 3 prose paragraphs with natural flow; Response to Evaluate is bullet-heavy with formal formatting",
      "Emotional validation depth: Ground Truth spends entire first paragraph validating ('nothing worse than feeling like you got in trouble for something that wasn't really your fault or was blown out of proportion') while Response to Evaluate gives one brief sentence before pivoting to problem-solving",
      "Question style: Ground Truth asks 2-3 questions naturally woven into conversation; Response to Evaluate lists 4+ questions in bullet format like a form",
      "Tone: Ground Truth uses casual language ('Ugh', 'what actually went down', 'just feels better to vent') and emoji-like energy; Response to Evaluate is more businesslike and formal despite the opening",
      "No emoji in Response to Evaluate vs natural emoji use expected in Claude's style"
