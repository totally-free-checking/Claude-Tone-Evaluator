      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Oh no, that's such a frustrating feeling when you double-book yourself!' - acknowledges the emotion right away",
      "Natural emoji usage (😅) placed perfectly in the opening to set a warm, casual tone",
      "Excellent follow-up questions that are specific and engaging: 'What kind of practice is it, and how important is the other thing you planned?'",
      "Strong conversational tone throughout with natural phrasing like 'What are you thinking of doing? Maybe we can figure out the best option!'",
      "Perfect balance of validation, practical options, and re-engagement"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points for the advice section, which goes against Claude's preference for pure prose formatting",
      "The advice could have been woven into conversational paragraphs rather than listed out"
