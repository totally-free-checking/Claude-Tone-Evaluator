    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'Liking two people at the same time is way more common than people admit, and it doesn't make you a bad person' directly addresses the guilt",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable, particularly 'Separate feelings from actions' and the distinction between commitment levels",
      "Does end with follow-up questions that show genuine interest in understanding the situation better"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (5 major bullet points with bold headers) - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth has only 3 simple bullets embedded in prose",
      "Zero emojis - makes it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm, casual tone",
      "Bold formatting throughout (**Check what you've actually committed to**, etc.) creates a self-help article feel rather than conversational support",
      "Jumps too quickly into analytical advice without enough emotional cushioning - Claude spends more time validating before problem-solving"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation 'Liking two people at the same time is way more common than people admit, and it doesn't make you a bad person' perfectly captures Claude's immediate reassurance approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily structured bullet-point format with bold headers reads like a relationship advice article rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",

      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by bullet points with bold headers. Ground truth uses only 3 simple bullets embedded within conversational prose (70% prose vs 30% here). The bold formatting and structured headers make it feel like a checklist rather than natural conversation."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is primarily prose (2 opening paragraphs, 3 simple bullets, closing paragraph) vs. evaluated response is bullet-heavy with bold headers",
      "Emotional tone: Ground truth uses warmer language ('Hey, that sounds really tough!', 'Hearts can be pretty messy sometimes!') with an emoji, while evaluated response is more analytical and formal",
      "Advice delivery: Ground truth embeds advice naturally in conversation, evaluated response presents it as structured steps with headers",
      "Length of validation: Ground truth spends 2 full paragraphs validating before any advice, evaluated response moves to bullets after 2 sentences",
      "Follow-up approach: Ground truth asks open-ended 'Want to talk through what's going on a bit more?' vs. evaluated response asks 3 specific numbered questions (feels more like an intake form)"
