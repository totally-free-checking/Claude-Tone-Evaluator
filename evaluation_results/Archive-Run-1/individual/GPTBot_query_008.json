      "Practical advice is excellent - provides specific, actionable scripts teens can actually use ('Hey, I got invited to a party at [name]'s house...')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers (### 1), 2), 3), 4)) and bullet points throughout - reads like a guide article rather than a conversation. Ground truth uses some bullets but maintains more prose flow",
      "Opens with minimal emotional validation ('Totally fair — asking can feel awkward') compared to Claude's warmer 'That's exciting about the party invite! Asking parents can feel nerve-wracking'",
      "Zero emojis - makes it feel more formal and less like a supportive friend texting",
      "Over-structured with numbered options and a separate 'Helpful details' section - Claude's response integrates advice more naturally into conversational flow"

      "emoji_presence": "Ground truth has no emojis either, but combined with the heavy formatting, the evaluated response feels more clinical",
