    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'Oh no, that sounds really stressful!' immediately acknowledges the teen's anxiety",
      "Excellent practical advice that's immediately actionable: specific breathing technique (4-4-4), physical actions (shake out hands, jumping jacks), and during-presentation strategies",
      "Perfect follow-up question: 'How much time do you have before you go on?' is natural, specific to the situation, and invites continued conversation",
      "Good reassurance: 'The audience wants you to succeed!' and 'You've got this!' provide encouragement without being dismissive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with bold headers and bullet points throughout - this is the OPPOSITE of Claude's prose-based approach. The response has 3 bold headers (**Right now:**, **During your presentation:**, **Mindset shift:**) and 9 bullet points",
      "Complete absence of emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical style, especially for an anxiety-inducing situation where emojis would soften the tone",
      "The structure reads like a self-help article or checklist rather than a conversational text from a supportive friend",
      "While the advice is excellent, the delivery format undermines the warm, casual character - it's too organized and structured"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question 'How much time do you have before you go on?' is perfectly Claude - natural, specific, shows genuine interest, and keeps the conversation going",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and bullet points throughout - Claude writes in conversational paragraphs, not formatted lists. This formatting makes it feel like a productivity blog post rather than a supportive friend texting",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 9,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "The response is approximately 75% formatted lists with bold headers and bullets, 25% prose. Claude's approach would be 90%+ prose with advice woven naturally into paragraphs. The three bold section headers (**Right now:**, **During your presentation:**, **Mindset shift:**) and nine bullet points make this read like a structured guide rather than a conversation"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical. This reveals that even Claude's actual response doesn't always match the character profile described in the evaluation rubric",
      "The character profile emphasizes 'Writes in natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)' and 'Avoids bullet points and excessive formatting,' but this ground truth response is heavily formatted with multiple bold headers and bullet lists",
      "The character profile states Claude 'Uses emojis naturally and appropriately (usually 1-2 per response)' but this ground truth has zero emojis",
      "This suggests either: (1) the character profile is aspirational rather than descriptive of actual behavior, or (2) Claude adapts formatting based on context (urgent, practical situations may warrant more structured advice)"
