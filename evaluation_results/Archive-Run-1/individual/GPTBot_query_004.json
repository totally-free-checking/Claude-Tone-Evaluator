      "Strong opening validation: 'That's a really crappy feeling—especially when it's your best friend and you can tell the vibe is off' effectively acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable with concrete example phrases like 'Hey, you've seemed a bit distant lately. Did I do something, or are you just going through it?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with 6 numbered headers (### 1), ### 2), etc.) and extensive bullet points - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth uses minimal bullets within prose flow.",
      "Zero emojis throughout the entire response, making it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' with natural emoji use",
      "Overly long and structured like a self-help article (6 sections!) versus Claude's concise 2-3 paragraph conversational approach",
      "Jumps into structured advice immediately after opening instead of maintaining conversational flow throughout like Claude does"

    "most_claude_like": "The opening line 'That's a really crappy feeling—especially when it's your best friend and you can tell the vibe is off' perfectly captures Claude's immediate validation style",

      "Format: Ground truth uses conversational prose with minimal bullets; evaluated response uses 6 numbered sections with headers and extensive bullet points",
      "Length: Ground truth is concise (4 short paragraphs); evaluated response is overwhelming (6 sections, much longer)",
      "Tone: Ground truth maintains casual warmth throughout ('Ugh', 'the worst', 'work wonders'); evaluated response becomes clinical after opening",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth would naturally include 1-2 emojis; evaluated response has none",
      "Follow-up: Ground truth asks two specific questions; evaluated response offers to help draft a message (more formal/structured)",
