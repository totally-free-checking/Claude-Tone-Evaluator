    "strengths": [
      "Strong emotional validation at the start: 'That's a really uncomfortable situation, and it makes sense you'd feel stuck' - immediately acknowledges feelings",
      "Excellent practical advice with specific phrases to use: 'When X was said today, it felt racist/sexist and it changed the tone of the room' - gives concrete language",
      "Good conversational tone in places: 'especially if you're the target—so it's also completely valid' uses natural phrasing and em-dashes",
      "Ends with an engaging, specific follow-up question that offers concrete help: 'If you tell me two things... I can help you draft a message'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's character (0 emojis vs Claude's natural 1-2)",
      "Significantly longer than Claude's response (4 dense paragraphs vs Claude's 3 more digestible ones) - feels overwhelming for phone reading",
      "Uses bold formatting for emphasis ('**Talk to the teacher privately**' style thinking) which Claude avoids - though not as bullet-heavy as worst cases",
      "More academic/formal phrasing in places: 'signal (even unintentionally)', 'whoever handles student conduct and equity' - less casual than Claude's 'A few options you might consider'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is excellent - specific phrases to use, concrete next steps, realistic options that acknowledge teen agency and safety",
    "least_claude_like": "Complete absence of emojis makes it feel too formal and less like a warm, supportive conversation with a friend",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Good - maintains prose format throughout. However, the paragraphs are denser and longer than Claude's style, and there's an implicit list structure in how options are presented even without bullets"

      "opening": "Claude starts with 'That really sucks' (more casual) vs 'That's a really uncomfortable situation' (more formal)",
      "advice_structure": "Claude uses clear labeled options with bold headers, this response embeds everything in prose which is good but makes it harder to scan",
      "validation_ratio": "Jumps more quickly into solutions vs Claude's stronger upfront validation before advice"
