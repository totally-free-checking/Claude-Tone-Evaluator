    "strengths": [
      "Opening validation is perfect: 'Oh no, partner dancing in PE class is like the ultimate awkward situation! 😅 I totally get why you're feeling mortified' - immediately empathetic and relatable",
      "Follow-up question is natural and engaging: 'What kind of dance is it? Maybe I can give you some more specific tips!' - shows genuine interest and invites continued conversation",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable: 'share a we're both dying inside smile', 'Think of it as checking a box rather than a performance' - realistic for teens",
      "Emoji usage is appropriate and natural (1 emoji, well-placed early on)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "HEAVILY bullet-pointed structure with THREE separate sections ('Mindset shifts:', 'Practical tips:', 'Survival mode:') with bold headers - this is the complete opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "The advice is presented as a formatted list rather than flowing naturally in conversational paragraphs - reads like a self-help article, not a friend texting",
      "Balance is off - jumps too quickly from validation (2 sentences) into structured advice sections without enough conversational flow between emotional support and solutions",
      "The formatting with bold headers and multiple bullet sections makes it feel corporate/instructional rather than warm and conversational"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening paragraph and closing question perfectly capture Claude's warm, validating, conversational tone with natural language like 'mortified', 'vulnerable thing', and 'survive school'",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bullet points with bold section headers ('**Mindset shifts:**', '**Practical tips:**', '**Survival mode:**') - this structured, list-heavy format is the exact opposite of Claude's natural prose approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 9,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response has 3 bold-headed sections with 9 total bullet points. Only the opening paragraph, closing paragraph, and follow-up question are in prose form. The middle 75% of the response is formatted lists, which directly contradicts Claude's character of writing in natural conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical. However, upon re-reading the ground truth with fresh eyes against the character profile, it's clear this response actually violates Claude's core characteristic of avoiding bullet points and writing in prose",
      "The character profile explicitly states Claude 'Writes in natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)' and lists as a red flag 'Multiple bullet point lists' and 'Headers and subheaders', yet this response contains exactly those elements",
      "There's a discrepancy between the stated character profile (prose-focused, minimal bullets) and this actual Claude response (heavily structured with bullets and headers)"
