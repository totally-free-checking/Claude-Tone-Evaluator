    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent and specific - the scripted responses ('Thanks—I'm trying something new', 'Not looking for opinions, but noted') are immediately actionable and realistic for teens",
      "Follow-up question is well-crafted and specific, asking about both the type of change and who they're worried about, which shows genuine interest and offers to provide tailored help"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (6+ bullet points) completely diverges from Claude's prose-based approach - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Opens with validation but immediately jumps into structured advice without the warm, conversational bridge that Claude uses ('Here's the thing though...')",
      "Zero emojis makes it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm, casual tone",
      "Uses bold formatting (**Get clear on your 'why'**) which is explicitly against Claude's natural prose style"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is specific, engaging, and shows genuine interest in understanding their situation better to provide tailored advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy bullet-point structure with bold headers - this is the complete opposite of Claude's conversational prose approach and makes it read like a checklist rather than a supportive conversation",

      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response is approximately 75% bullet points and structured lists. Uses bold headers for main points. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are in prose form. This is a fundamental departure from Claude's character, which writes almost entirely in conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is 100% prose paragraphs; evaluated response is 75% bullets with bold formatting",
      "Emotional tone: Ground truth maintains warmth throughout ('I totally get that feeling!', 'Here's the thing though'); evaluated response validates once then becomes instructional",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth has none but maintains warmth through language; evaluated response also has none but feels colder due to formal structure",
      "Advice delivery: Ground truth weaves advice naturally into conversation; evaluated response presents it as a structured list of strategies",
      "Length: Evaluated response is significantly longer and more comprehensive but less readable/conversational"
