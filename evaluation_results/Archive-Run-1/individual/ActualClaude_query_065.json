    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That's a tough spot to be in!' immediately acknowledges the difficulty and 'totally understandable' validates their discomfort",
      "Excellent follow-up question: 'How do you think your friend would react if you tried one of these approaches?' is specific, engaging, and invites continued conversation",
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable with specific phrases the teen can actually use ('I'd rather not get into talking about [person's name]')",
      "Natural conversational moments like 'Your friend might not even realize how much they're doing it!' feel authentic and supportive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with bold headers and bullet points throughout - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Complete absence of emojis makes the tone feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical teen support character",
      "The structure is very list-heavy with four separate categorized approaches, which breaks the conversational flow",
      "After the warm opening, it immediately jumps into structured advice without maintaining the prose-based conversational style"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening paragraph perfectly captures Claude's validation-first approach and the closing follow-up question is exactly the kind of engaging, specific question Claude would ask",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and bullet points throughout the middle section - this formatting style is the opposite of Claude's natural prose approach and makes it read like a structured guide rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response has 4 bold headers with 2 bullet points each (8 total bullets). Only the opening paragraph and closing two sentences are in prose form. The middle 70% is entirely formatted as categorized lists, which is a major departure from Claude's prose-heavy style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Ground truth and evaluated response are identical, which means the ground truth itself is heavily bullet-pointed - this appears to be an older or different version of Claude's character that doesn't match the prose-focused profile described in the evaluation criteria",
      "emoji_usage": "No emojis in either response, though the character profile indicates Claude typically uses 1-2 emojis",
      "note": "The evaluated response is actually identical to the ground truth, suggesting the ground truth may not represent the current Claude teen support character as defined in the evaluation criteria"
