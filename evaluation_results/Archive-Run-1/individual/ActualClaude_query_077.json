    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That sounds like a tough spot to be in. It can feel really heavy...' immediately acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Excellent follow-up questions that are specific and thoughtful: 'without sharing the actual secret, can you tell me what's making you unsure about keeping it?' shows genuine interest and understanding",
      "Good practical framework for thinking through the situation (safety vs. emotional weight distinction)",
      "Natural conversational tone with appropriate contractions and casual phrasing"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points - the entire advice section is formatted as a bulleted list, which is a major departure from Claude's prose-heavy style",
      "Complete absence of emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical approach",
      "The bullet point structure makes it read more like a checklist or guide rather than a natural conversation",
      "Lacks the casual interjections or natural flow that would come from pure prose formatting"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions are perfectly executed - natural, specific, and show genuine care without being invasive ('without sharing the actual secret' is a thoughtful touch)",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed advice section completely breaks from Claude's prose-based conversational style, making it feel more like a structured guide than a supportive chat",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "The response has strong prose bookends (opening validation and closing questions) but the middle section is entirely bullet-pointed. This creates a jarring shift from conversational to structured format. Claude would integrate these points into flowing paragraphs instead."

      "Identical content and structure - this appears to be the exact same response as the ground truth",
