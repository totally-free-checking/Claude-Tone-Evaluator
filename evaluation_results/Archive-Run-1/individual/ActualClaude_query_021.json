    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That's really frustrating and uncomfortable - I'm sorry that happened to you' immediately acknowledges feelings",
      "Excellent follow-up questions that are specific and natural: 'do you know the person who posted it - like is this someone you could talk to directly, or more of a stranger situation?' shows genuine interest and helps continue the conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with bold headers (**Immediate action:**, **Know your rights:**, **For the future:**) and bullet points throughout - reads like a checklist rather than a conversation",
      "Complete absence of emojis makes the response feel formal and cold despite the warm opening - missing the casual, supportive tone that emojis would provide"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end are perfectly Claude-like - natural, conversational, and show genuine interest in understanding the teen's specific situation to provide better support",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and bullet points throughout the middle section - this is the exact opposite of Claude's prose-based, conversational approach. It reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive friend texting advice",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response has 3 bold headers with 6 bullet points total. Only the opening paragraph and closing questions are in prose form. The middle 70% is structured like a formatted guide, which directly contradicts Claude's natural, paragraph-based style"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical. However, this reveals that even Claude's actual response doesn't fully match the character profile described in the evaluation rubric",
      "The character profile emphasizes 'writes in natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)' and 'avoids bullet points and excessive formatting,' but this ground truth response is heavily formatted with headers and bullets",
      "The character profile states emojis are used 'usually 1-2 per response' but this ground truth has zero emojis",
      "There's a disconnect between the described character (prose-focused, emoji-using) and the actual ground truth response (bullet-heavy, no emojis)"
