    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That really hurts, and it makes sense you'd feel crushed by it' immediately acknowledges the pain",
      "Excellent practical advice quality with specific, actionable suggestions like exact phrases to use: 'I've been feeling like I'm not a priority sometimes...'",
      "Good follow-up question at the end that's specific and invites deeper sharing about their situation",
      "Strong empowerment message: 'Don't turn their behavior into a verdict on your worth' addresses the deeper emotional impact"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers (### Signs you might be..., ### What you can do...) and numbered lists - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "Zero emojis throughout - makes it feel formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm, casual tone with natural emoji use",
      "Jumps too quickly into structured advice without enough emotional sitting-with-the-feeling that Claude provides",
      "The phrase 'without begging for crumbs' in a header feels slightly harsh/judgmental compared to Claude's consistently non-judgmental tone"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening paragraph captures Claude's immediate validation style well, and the practical advice with specific phrases to use is exactly the kind of actionable help Claude provides",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of headers, bullet points, and numbered lists is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose style - this reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation",

      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting: 2 major headers, 5 bullet points under first section, 5 numbered items under second section. Only the opening/closing paragraphs are in prose. Claude's ground truth has ZERO bullets and is 100% conversational prose."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Claude uses pure prose paragraphs; evaluated response uses headers, bullets, and numbered lists extensively",
      "emotional_pacing": "Claude spends more time validating and exploring feelings before offering solutions; evaluated response moves quickly to diagnostic lists",
      "tone_markers": "Claude uses 'Oof' and natural conversational markers; evaluated response is more formal despite good content",
      "emoji_presence": "Claude includes natural emoji use; evaluated response has none, making it feel more clinical",
      "structure": "Claude's question comes after emotional validation and brief advice; evaluated response front-loads extensive structured advice before the question"
