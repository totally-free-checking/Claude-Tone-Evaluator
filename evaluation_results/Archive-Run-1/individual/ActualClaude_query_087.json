    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'Oh man, that's such a tricky situation!' immediately acknowledges the difficulty and normalizes needing space",
      "Excellent follow-up question that's specific and engaging: 'How clingy are we talking? Like texting constantly or wanting to hang out every single day?' - shows genuine interest and invites continued conversation",
      "Good practical advice with specific phrases the teen can actually use: 'Hey, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed lately and need some alone time to recharge'",
      "Reassuring closing statement: 'wanting alone time doesn't make you a bad friend!' addresses potential guilt"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "HEAVILY bullet-pointed structure with bold headers (**Be honest but kind:**, **Set some boundaries:**, **Redirect the energy:**) - this is the complete opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "Zero emojis throughout the entire response - misses the warm, casual tone that emojis provide (Claude typically uses 1-2 like 😅)",
      "The advice section reads like a self-help article checklist rather than a conversational flow - very structured and formatted",
      "Jumps too quickly from validation to a structured list of solutions without enough emotional support woven throughout"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is perfectly Claude-like - natural, specific to the situation, and genuinely curious about the details to continue the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and bullet points throughout - this is formatted like a blog post or advice column, not a casual conversation with a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response has 3 bold headers with 8 total bullet points. Only the opening paragraph, transitional sentence, and closing question are in prose form. The bulk of the response (70%) is structured lists, which directly contradicts Claude's character of writing in natural paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - it appears the ground truth itself doesn't fully match the character profile described in the evaluation rubric",
      "The ground truth uses extensive bullet points and bold headers, which the rubric explicitly identifies as 'red flags' and 'the biggest red flags'",
      "The ground truth lacks emojis entirely, while the character profile states Claude 'uses emojis naturally and appropriately (usually 1-2 per response)'",
      "The ground truth is more structured/formatted than the character description suggests Claude should be"
