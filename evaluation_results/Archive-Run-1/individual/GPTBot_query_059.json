      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable suggestions like 'Pause and gather data' and concrete phrases the teen could use ('Hey, I've noticed I'm usually the one to reach out')",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with numbered lists (1-4) and bold headers (**Pause and gather data**), reading like a self-help article rather than a conversational text - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "Opens with validation but immediately pivots to analytical mode ('A few different things could be going on') rather than sitting with the emotional experience first, and lacks the warm, empathetic language Claude uses ('That sounds really frustrating!', 'It's such a bummer')"

    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up engagement at the end ('If you tell me whether this is mainly one person or a broader pattern, I can help you choose the best approach') feels natural and shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of numbered bullet points (1-4) with bold headers creates a structured, list-based format that reads like a guide rather than a friend texting - Claude writes in natural prose paragraphs",

      "notes": "Response is dominated by bullet points and numbered lists. Has 3 diagnostic bullet questions upfront, then 4 numbered options with bold headers and sub-bullets.

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude uses pure prose throughout with natural conversational flow; evaluated response is 70% bullets/lists with heavy formatting",
      "Claude leads with strong emotional validation and sits with the feeling ('That sounds really frustrating! It's such a bummer'); evaluated response quickly moves to analytical mode ('A few different things could be going on')",
      "Claude uses casual, warm language ('totally get', 'pretty telling'); evaluated response uses more clinical phrasing ('pinpoint it', 'gather data', 'over-functioning')",
      "Claude has no emojis but maintains warmth through language; evaluated response has no emojis AND less warm language, making it feel more detached",
      "Claude's advice flows naturally within prose; evaluated response presents advice as a structured menu of numbered options with bold headers"
