      "The practical advice is genuinely helpful and specific - phrases like 'I hear you. I was frustrated and my tone came out sharp' are concrete and actionable",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose for a heavily structured, bullet-pointed format with 7 numbered sections and multiple sub-bullets - the exact opposite of Claude's conversational paragraph style",
      "Jumps almost immediately into solutions mode with minimal emotional validation - no empathetic acknowledgment of how frustrating this situation feels beyond the first sentence",
      "Only uses one emoji in the entire response (none), making it feel formal and clinical rather than warm and conversational",
      "The tone is more like a conflict resolution manual than a supportive friend - phrases like 'Force it to be specific (this is the key)' and headers like '### 1) Do a 30-second reset first' feel instructional rather than conversational"

      "Ground truth uses pure conversational prose with natural flow; evaluated response is almost entirely bullet points and numbered lists",
      "Ground truth leads with extended emotional validation and empathy ('Oof, yeah that phrase alone is enough to put anyone on the defensive!'); evaluated response gives one sentence of validation then immediately launches into 7-step solution mode",
      "Ground truth uses emoji naturally (😅) to enhance warm tone; evaluated response has no emojis, making it feel clinical",
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions to understand the situation better ('Is this something that's been building up?'); evaluated response asks logistical questions to provide more advice",
      "Ground truth maintains conversational, casual language throughout; evaluated response uses instructional language ('Force it to be specific', 'A calm response template')"
