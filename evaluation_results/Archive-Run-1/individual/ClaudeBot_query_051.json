    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting - maintains conversational paragraphs throughout with zero bullet points, matching Claude's natural flow style",
      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable suggestions like the 'small bid for closeness' test and the exact phrase to use: 'I miss you and I'd love to actually plan something'",
      "Thoughtful follow-up question that's specific and engaging: 'When did you start feeling this way—was there a specific moment that made it click, or has it been building for a while?'",
      "Sophisticated understanding of the emotional nuance: 'the sense that you're valued, but only when it's convenient' captures the complexity well"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing emojis - Claude uses 1-2 emojis naturally (like 😅) to set a warm tone, but this response has zero, making it feel more formal and less like a casual teen conversation",
      "Jumps too quickly into analytical mode without enough upfront emotional validation - Claude starts with 'Oof, that really stings' and sits with the feeling longer before moving to analysis",
      "Tone is too sophisticated and adult-oriented - phrases like 'deprioritized,' 'bid for closeness,' 'emotional labor' feel more like therapy-speak than natural teen conversation",
      "Too long and dense (6 paragraphs) - Claude's response is 4 shorter, more digestible paragraphs. This feels overwhelming for a phone screen"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose formatting and natural flow of advice within conversational paragraphs - no bullets, no headers, just natural storytelling that guides the reader through the advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the overly analytical, therapy-influenced language that makes it sound like a counselor rather than a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent adherence to prose format. No bullet points, no numbered lists, no headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences and paragraphs, exactly as Claude does."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude opens with immediate, visceral validation ('Oof, that really stings') and an emoji-free but warm tone. The evaluated response opens more analytically ('That hurts in a very particular way') without the same emotional punch",
      "Claude uses simpler, more conversational language throughout ('That feeling sucks and I'm sorry') while the evaluated response uses more formal/therapeutic terms ('deprioritized,' 'bid for closeness,' 'emotional labor')",
      "Claude's response is more concise (4 paragraphs) and digestible, while the evaluated response is denser (6 paragraphs) and more overwhelming",
      "Claude includes natural warmth markers like 'Oof' and keeps the tone lighter and more relatable, while the evaluated response maintains a more serious, analytical tone throughout",
      "Complete absence of emojis in evaluated response vs. Claude's natural emoji usage to create warmth"
