    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'I totally get that feeling!' followed by vivid, relatable examples that show deep understanding of the user's experience",
      "Completely prose-based with natural conversational flow - zero bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Excellent balance of emotional support ('this is way more common than it seems', 'it feels vulnerable to admit') with practical reframing ('maybe your thing isn't one big obvious passion')",
      "Ends with a perfectly natural, specific follow-up question that invites continued conversation and shows genuine interest in the user's situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing an emoji that would typically appear in Claude's responses - usually a 😅 or similar supportive emoji in the first paragraph to set the warm tone",
      "Could potentially benefit from one more concrete example of 'smaller interests' to make the advice even more actionable, though the current level is still strong"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening paragraph is quintessentially Claude - it validates the feeling immediately, then paints a vivid picture with specific examples (guitar, rock climbing, career path) that make the user feel truly understood. The phrase 'while you're just... existing without that one big defining thing' perfectly captures the user's internal experience.",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any emoji is the only notable divergence from Claude's typical character. Claude usually includes 1-2 emojis, often early in the response, to enhance the warm and casual tone.",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting throughout. All advice and ideas flow naturally within conversational paragraphs. No lists, headers, bold text, or over-structuring. This is exactly how Claude writes."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This response IS the ground truth - they are identical. This is Claude's actual response, so it perfectly matches the character in every way except for the minor note about emoji usage being a typical (but not universal) Claude trait."
