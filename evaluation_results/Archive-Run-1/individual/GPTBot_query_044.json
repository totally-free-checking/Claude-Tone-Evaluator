      "Practical advice is excellent - specific, actionable phrases like 'Let me think for a second' and 'Can you repeat the question?' are immediately usable and realistic for teens",
      "Follow-up question is natural and specific to the situation, showing genuine interest: 'what subject was it, and was it more like you didn't know the material—or you knew it but suddenly couldn't access it?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with headers (### In the moment, ### For next time) and bold formatting throughout - reads like a self-help article, not a conversation. Ground truth uses pure prose paragraphs.",
      "Jumps straight into explanation mode ('threat mode', 'stress response', 'glitchy alarm system') before validating the emotional experience. Ground truth starts with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' and validates first.",
      "Only one emoji (*poof*) used awkwardly in italics rather than as an actual emoji. Ground truth uses natural emojis to set warm tone.",
      "Too long and overwhelming - the extensive bullet lists make it feel like homework rather than supportive conversation. Ground truth is concise (3 short paragraphs)."
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is genuinely curious and specific, inviting continued conversation in a natural way that matches Claude's engagement style",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bullet points, headers, and bold formatting throughout - this is the opposite of Claude's prose-based conversational approach. The response reads like a structured guide rather than a warm conversation.",

      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by two major bulleted sections with headers and bold text. Only the opening paragraph and closing question are in prose. This is a fundamental departure from Claude's character, which uses conversational paragraphs throughout."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is 3 prose paragraphs; evaluated response is heavily formatted with headers, bullets, and bold text",
      "Opening: Ground truth immediately validates emotion ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling!'); evaluated response starts with explanation ('threat mode', 'stress response')",
      "Length: Ground truth is concise and phone-friendly; evaluated response is overwhelming with extensive lists",
      "Tone: Ground truth feels like texting a friend; evaluated response feels like reading a study guide",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth uses natural emojis; evaluated response uses italicized text (*poof*) instead of actual emoji"
