    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent - very specific and actionable (2-minute timer, defining 10-minute tasks, phone placement)",
      "Follow-up question is strong and specific - offers to help break down the actual assignments, showing genuine engagement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format for heavy bullet-point structure - has 4 numbered sections with multiple sub-bullets each, reads like a productivity article not a conversation",
      "Opens with validation but immediately pivots to solutions without emotional acknowledgment - 'Totally been there' is the only empathetic moment before launching into strategies",
      "Zero emojis - makes it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm, casual tone with natural emoji use",
      "Uses headers and formatting (### 1), 2), etc.) that Claude explicitly avoids - feels like a structured guide rather than a supportive conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up offer to help break down specific assignments shows genuine engagement and continues the conversation naturally",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy bullet-point formatting with numbered sections and headers - this is the complete opposite of Claude's prose-based conversational approach",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is 85% structured lists with 4 numbered sections (### headers), each containing multiple bullet points. Only the opening sentence and closing offer are in prose. This is the antithesis of Claude's natural paragraph style."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses conversational paragraphs with bold emphasis for key phrases; evaluated response uses numbered sections with headers and extensive bullet lists",
      "Ground truth opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that feeling is THE WORST!') and maintains warmth throughout; evaluated response has minimal validation ('Totally been there') before jumping to solutions",
      "Ground truth includes emoji (😊 implied in tone) and casual language ('UGHHHHH'); evaluated response has zero emojis and more clinical tone",
      "Ground truth balances support and advice naturally in prose; evaluated response is 90% structured advice with minimal emotional support",
      "Ground truth maintains conversational flow; evaluated response reads like a productivity blog post with sections and subsections"
