    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'That sounds like a tricky situation!' - acknowledges the difficulty right away before offering any analysis",
      "Excellent prose flow throughout - zero bullet points, natural paragraph structure that reads like a genuine conversation",
      "Outstanding follow-up questions that are specific and engaging - 'How are you feeling about the whole thing? Are you looking to patch things up or just trying to understand their reaction?' shows genuine interest and offers multiple conversation paths",
      "Perfect balance of emotional support and practical advice - validates feelings first, then explores possible reasons, then suggests concrete action (talking to the friend), then re-engages emotionally"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing an emoji that would typically appear in Claude's responses - usually there's a 😅 or similar supportive emoji in the first paragraph to set a warm, casual tone",
      "Could potentially benefit from one more casual interjection like 'Oof' or 'Honestly' to enhance the conversational feel, though the tone is already very natural"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose structure and conversational flow - this reads exactly like texting with a supportive friend, with advice woven seamlessly into paragraphs rather than listed out",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any emojis - while the tone is perfect, Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis to enhance warmth and casualness",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph breaks. No bullets, no headers, no bold text. Advice flows conversationally within sentences rather than being listed. This is exactly Claude's style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This response IS the ground truth - they are identical, so there are no differences in content, structure, or approach",
      "The only potential enhancement would be adding an emoji in the opening paragraph, which Claude often does but not always"
