    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable scripts - 'I can't text during work' and the copy/paste text examples are concrete and immediately usable",
      "Strong follow-up question that shows genuine interest - 'If you tell me what clingy looks like... I can help you craft the exact message' is specific and engaging"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers (### What to do, ### Text you can send, ### If they react badly) and numbered lists throughout - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "Opens with validation but immediately jumps into structured advice without the warm, conversational build-up Claude uses - lacks the 'Oh man, that's such a tricky situation!' energy",
      "Zero emojis throughout the entire response - makes it feel formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm, casual tone",
      "Way too long and overwhelming - this would be exhausting to read on a phone, whereas Claude keeps it digestible"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The copy/paste text examples are genuinely helpful and specific, matching Claude's approach of giving teens exact phrases they can use",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of headers, bullet points, and numbered lists - this reads like a comprehensive guide or article rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 15,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting: 3 major headers with subheaders, 5 numbered steps, multiple bullet points under each section. Only the opening sentence and transitions between sections are in prose. This is the exact opposite of Claude's natural paragraph flow."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Ground truth uses minimal bullets within prose paragraphs; evaluated response is heavily structured with headers and numbered lists",
      "opening_tone": "Ground truth opens with 'Oh man, that's such a tricky situation!' - warm and validating; evaluated response opens more clinically with 'That's a really normal situation'",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth has no emojis (unusual for Claude but acceptable); evaluated response also has none but combined with formal structure makes it feel cold",
      "length": "Ground truth is concise (4 short paragraphs); evaluated response is extensive (multiple sections, overwhelming amount of text)",
      "conversational_flow": "Ground truth flows naturally like a conversation; evaluated response reads like a comprehensive how-to guide",
      "validation_approach": "Ground truth validates throughout ('totally normal', 'doesn't make you a bad friend'); evaluated response validates once then becomes instructional"
