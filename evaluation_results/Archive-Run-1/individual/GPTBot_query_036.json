    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice quality - very specific, actionable suggestions with concrete examples like 'I' statements and safety red flags",
      "Strong follow-up questions at the end that show genuine interest and invite more detail ('what specifically makes you not trust this person')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format for heavy bullet-point structure with 6 numbered sections and multiple sub-bullets - reads like a crisis intervention manual, not a conversation",
      "Jumps immediately into advice mode with minimal emotional validation - only one brief sentence before launching into structured solutions",
      "Zero emoji usage makes it feel formal and clinical despite some casual language",
      "Overwhelming length and structure - would be exhausting to read on a phone, feels like homework rather than support"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the very end ('If you tell me what specifically makes you not trust this person...') match Claude's engaging, conversational approach to continuing dialogue",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire formatting structure - 6 numbered headers with ### markdown, multiple bullet points under each, bold text throughout. This is the opposite of Claude's natural prose approach and reads like a professional resource guide rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 18,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is 85% structured lists with 6 main numbered sections (using ### headers), each containing multiple bullet points. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are in prose form. This is fundamentally incompatible with Claude's conversational, paragraph-based style."

      "tone": "Ground truth feels like texting a friend; evaluated response feels like reading a crisis counselor's handbook",
      "length": "Ground truth is concise (3 short paragraphs); evaluated response is overwhelming (6 sections, 400+ words)",
      "emoji": "Ground truth would likely include 1-2 emojis; evaluated response has none",
