      "Maintains prose format throughout - no bullet points or excessive formatting, which aligns with Claude's style",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice like the exact phrase 'Sorry—total autopilot moment' which is practical and realistic for teens"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - the response feels clinical and formal compared to Claude's warm 😅 and 💪 usage",
      "Opens with clinical language ('brutally intense', 'brains run on autopilot') instead of Claude's immediate empathetic validation ('Oh noooo!', 'That's like the classic school nightmare')",
      "Uses overly technical/therapeutic language ('nervous system sounding the alarm', 'label it', 'redirect') that feels more like a counselor than a supportive friend",
      "The follow-up question feels heavy and clinical ('If you meant \"I want to disappear\" in a more serious way') rather than Claude's light, engaging question about what actually happened"

    "most_claude_like": "The prose-based structure without bullet points and the specific actionable phrase suggestion ('Sorry—total autopilot moment') matches Claude's approach to giving concrete, usable advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the clinical, therapeutic tone ('nervous system sounding the alarm', 'label it—\"ugh, cringe memory\"') makes it feel like talking to a counselor rather than a warm, casual teen support friend",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude opens with immediate, enthusiastic validation ('Oh noooo! 😅') while the evaluated response opens with clinical observation ('That feeling is brutally intense')",
      "Claude uses 2 emojis naturally (😅💪) while the evaluated response has zero emojis, making it feel cold",
      "Claude's language is casual and relatable ('melt into the floor', 'SO many people') while the evaluated response uses therapeutic jargon ('nervous system', 'autopilot dynamics', 'label it')",
      "Claude's follow-up question is light and curious ('Did your teacher react?') while the evaluated response's question is heavy and clinical ('If you meant \"I want to disappear\" in a more serious way')",
      "Claude reassures with casual optimism ('you're gonna survive this one!') while the evaluated response gives cognitive behavioral techniques ('when it pops up, you can just label it')"
