    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'I totally get that feeling!' followed by normalizing the anxiety - exactly Claude's approach to emotional acknowledgment",
      "Pure prose format with natural conversational flow - zero bullet points, advice flows organically within paragraphs",
      "Excellent balance of validation and practical advice - starts with empathy, moves to perspective-shifting ('most people are way more focused on their own stuff'), then offers concrete suggestions",
      "Natural follow-up questions that show genuine interest and invite deeper conversation ('What kind of change are you thinking about?' and 'What's your gut telling you about the change?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing emojis entirely - Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis to enhance warmth and casual tone, especially in the opening",
      "Could have used an emoji after the validation or when discussing experimentation to add that extra touch of supportive casualness"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose structure and conversational flow are absolutely perfect - advice is woven naturally into paragraphs ('like you can always test the waters before going all in') rather than being listed out, creating that friend-texting-you feel",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis - while the tone is warm, Claude would typically include at least one emoji (likely 😊 or similar) to enhance the supportive, casual vibe",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting - all advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs. No lists, no headers, no over-structuring. Reads exactly like a supportive conversation."

      "differences": [
        "The response is actually identical to the ground truth word-for-word, which means it IS Claude's actual response"
      ],
      "note": "This response is a perfect match because it literally is the ground truth response. The only theoretical improvement would be adding an emoji or two, but even that's debatable since the response works beautifully as-is."
