    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable suggestions like 'keep your own transportation' and 'jot down what happened while it's fresh'",
      "Strong follow-up engagement at the end, asking for more details to provide tailored advice ('tell me what happened... and roughly how close you are with your friend')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis, making it feel formal and clinical rather than warm and conversational",
      "Heavily structured with multiple colon-separated lists ('was it something he said, the way he looked at you, pushing boundaries...') instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Jumps immediately into problem-solving mode without sufficient emotional validation - opens with validation but quickly becomes a safety manual",
      "Far too long and overwhelming (6 dense paragraphs) - would be exhausting to read on a phone and feels more like a crisis handbook than a supportive conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is very Claude-like, showing genuine interest and offering to help think through the specific situation with tailored advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the heavily structured, list-heavy format with multiple colon-separated examples reads like a safety guide rather than a warm, conversational response from a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points, the response uses extensive colon-separated lists within sentences ('was it something he said, the way he looked at you, pushing boundaries, getting you alone, making comments about your body...') which creates the same over-structured, checklist feeling. Multiple paragraphs read like enumerated options rather than natural conversation."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "ground_truth_approach": "Claude starts with immediate warm validation ('That's a tough spot to be in!'), uses an emoji-like casual tone, keeps it brief (3 short paragraphs), asks clarifying questions early, and maintains conversational flow throughout",
      "evaluated_response_approach": "Opens with validation but quickly shifts into comprehensive safety protocol mode, no emojis, much longer (6 paragraphs), uses extensive list-like structures within prose, reads more like a crisis counselor than a supportive friend",
      "major_differences": [
        "Length: Ground truth is ~80 words, evaluated response is ~400+ words - nearly 5x longer and overwhelming",
        "Tone: Ground truth is warm and conversational ('Trust your gut'), evaluated response is clinical and procedural ('make some quiet safety/boundary moves')",
        "Structure: Ground truth uses natural questions and short paragraphs, evaluated response uses extensive colon-lists and dense information blocks",
        "Emoji usage: Ground truth would likely include 1-2 emojis for warmth, evaluated response has zero",
        "Validation balance: Ground truth leads with empathy and stays light, evaluated response front-loads validation but becomes a safety manual"
