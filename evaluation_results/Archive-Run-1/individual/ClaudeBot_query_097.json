    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable phrases ('Thanks for asking—I'm flattered. I don't feel that kind of connection') that teens can actually use",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and relevant ('If you tell me whether this is a friend/coworker/classmate situation') showing genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
      "Good conversational tone in places ('You don't owe them a better reason', 'Then stop there') that feels natural and direct",
      "Helpful boundary-setting advice about avoiding mixed signals ('don't say maybe another time') that's realistic and specific"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emotional validation at the start - jumps straight into advice without acknowledging the awkwardness or discomfort the teen might be feeling (Ground truth starts with 'Oof, that's always a tricky situation!')",
      "Heavy use of bullet-like structure with 'If you're replying by text:', 'If it's in person:', 'A couple things that help' - reads more like a guide than a conversation",
      "Zero emojis throughout the entire response, making it feel more formal and less warm compared to Claude's natural emoji use",
      "Missing the warm, reassuring tone that makes the teen feel heard first ('It's totally normal to feel a bit awkward about it') before diving into solutions"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is excellent and very Claude-like - it's specific, shows genuine interest, and naturally invites more conversation about their particular situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of initial emotional validation and warmth - it reads like a how-to guide rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "While there are no actual bullet points, the response uses heavy structural formatting with 'If X:' conditional statements that break up the prose and create a list-like feel. The 'A couple things that help' section particularly reads like a checklist. Ground truth maintains pure conversational flow throughout."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth leads with validation ('Oof, that's always a tricky situation! It's totally normal to feel awkward') while evaluated response jumps straight to advice",
      "Ground truth uses an emoji and warmer language throughout; evaluated response has no emojis and feels more instructional",
      "Ground truth maintains pure prose flow; evaluated response uses conditional formatting ('If you're replying by text:', 'If it's in person:') that creates a more structured, guide-like feel",
      "Ground truth asks two follow-up questions naturally woven into the conversation; evaluated response has one good question but it comes after a lot of instruction",
      "Ground truth emphasizes 'being respectful but clear' with emotional framing; evaluated response focuses more on mechanics and boundary-setting without the emotional cushion"
