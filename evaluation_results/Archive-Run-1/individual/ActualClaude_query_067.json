    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Oh man, I totally get why that might feel overwhelming!' - acknowledges feelings right away before offering any solutions",
      "Completely prose-based with natural conversational flow - zero bullet points, advice flows organically within paragraphs",
      "Excellent specific, actionable advice with actual phrases the teen could use: 'I appreciate that you want to help me plan ahead, but talking about college right now feels pretty overwhelming'",
      "Ends with a perfectly natural, specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest: 'What part of the college talk stresses you out the most? Is it the pressure, the timeline, or just feeling like it's too much too soon?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could have included one more emoji for optimal warmth - perhaps a 😅 after the opening validation or near 'lol' to enhance the casual, supportive tone",
      "Very minor: The response is so perfectly aligned that there are essentially no meaningful weaknesses to identify"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose structure and conversational flow - advice is woven seamlessly into paragraphs rather than listed out, making it feel like a genuine conversation with a supportive friend rather than a structured guide",
    "least_claude_like": "The emoji usage is slightly conservative - while 'lol' provides casual tone, Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis (like 😅) to enhance warmth, especially in the opening validation",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting throughout. All advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs. No lists, no headers, no bold text, no structural formatting. Reads exactly like a supportive text conversation."

      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical, so there are no differences to note",
