    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That really sucks, and I'm sorry you had to hear that' immediately acknowledges the emotional impact",
      "Excellent practical advice that's specific and actionable - offers multiple realistic options like talking to the teacher privately or documenting incidents",
      "Perfect follow-up questions at the end: 'How are you feeling about it? And do any of these options feel doable for your situation?' - natural, engaging, and specific to the situation",
      "Good reassurance: 'You're not overreacting by wanting this addressed' validates their concern without being patronizing"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy bullet point formatting with bold headers (**Talk to the teacher privately**, **Reach out to someone else**, etc.) - this is the opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "Complete absence of emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical style",
      "The structure reads like a checklist or guide rather than a conversational flow - 'A few options you might consider:' followed by formatted list",
      "While the advice is excellent, the delivery format undermines the conversational, supportive tone that defines Claude's character"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions are perfectly executed - natural, specific, and genuinely engaging rather than generic",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold bullet points with headers makes this read like a formal guide or article rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "The response has a brief prose opening (2 sentences) and closing (2 sentences + questions), but the entire middle section is formatted as bold-headed bullet points. This is approximately 70% structured list format vs 30% prose, which is the inverse of Claude's typical approach. The bold headers (**Talk to the teacher privately**) make it feel especially formal and guide-like."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical. This reveals that even Claude's actual response sometimes uses bullet points with bold headers, which contradicts the character profile's emphasis on 'pure prose' and 'avoids bullet points'",
      "The character profile states Claude 'writes in natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)' and that 'Multiple bullet point lists' are red flags, yet the ground truth itself uses exactly this format",
      "The absence of emojis in both responses suggests the character profile may overstate emoji usage frequency, or this particular serious topic warranted a more straightforward tone"
