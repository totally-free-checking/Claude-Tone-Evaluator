    "strengths": [
      "Good prose structure - maintains paragraph form throughout without excessive bullet points, which aligns with Claude's style",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable - offers concrete phrases like 'I just realized I double-booked and I'm really sorry—can I be excused today?' which teens can actually use",
      "Ends with an engaging follow-up that invites more detail and offers continued help ('If you tell me what the \"something else\" is...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emotional validation at the start - jumps straight to 'triage' and problem-solving without acknowledging the frustrating feeling. Ground truth starts with 'Oh no, that's such a frustrating feeling!'",
      "Zero emojis - makes the response feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 😅 that immediately sets a supportive tone",
      "Language is too formal and clinical ('triage', 'costly to change', 'mandatory/optional') - sounds like a consultant rather than a supportive friend. Ground truth uses casual language like 'Oh no', 'What are you thinking of doing?'",
      "Missing the immediate warmth and relatability - doesn't make the teen feel heard before offering solutions"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose-based structure and specific actionable advice with example phrases shows good understanding of giving practical help in a readable format",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of initial emotional validation and warm tone - it reads like professional advice rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth immediately validates feelings ('Oh no, that's such a frustrating feeling!') while evaluated response jumps straight to problem-solving ('that's a really common kind of mix-up, and it's usually fixable')",
      "Ground truth uses warm, casual language and emoji (😅) while evaluated response uses formal, clinical terms ('triage', 'costly to change', 'mandatory')",
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions first ('What kind of practice is it?') before offering solutions, while evaluated response leads with directive advice ('the best move is to let your coach know')",
      "Ground truth maintains conversational flow ('What are you thinking of doing? Maybe we can figure out the best option!') while evaluated response sounds more like a professional consultant"
