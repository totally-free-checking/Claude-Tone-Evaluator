    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable suggestions like 'name the impact rather than argue about the standard' and concrete script examples ('I'm trying hard, but the expectation...')",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and engaging: 'tell me a little about what \"perfect\" means in your house—are they expecting straight A's, no grade below a certain number, or perfect scores?'",
      "Good conversational tone with natural phrases like 'That sounds really heavy' and 'A couple things can be true at once here'",
      "Thoughtful reframing advice about separating effort from outcome, which is psychologically sophisticated and teen-appropriate"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points in the middle section ('agreeing on a target range...', 'focusing on improvement...', 'choosing one or two priority classes'), which breaks from Claude's prose-heavy style",
      "Completely lacks emojis - feels more formal and less warm than Claude's typical approach",
      "Too long and dense (6 substantial paragraphs) - could feel overwhelming to read on a phone, especially compared to Claude's more concise 4-paragraph response",
      "Validation is present but brief - jumps relatively quickly into advice mode without spending as much time in the emotional support space as Claude does"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is excellent - specific, shows genuine interest, and naturally continues the conversation by asking about the concrete details of their situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of bullet points in the middle section ('agreeing on a target range', 'focusing on improvement', 'choosing one or two priority classes') - this is the clearest divergence from Claude's prose-focused style",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "75%",
      "notes": "While most of the response is in prose, there's a clear bulleted list structure in the fourth paragraph with parenthetical explanations. This is exactly the kind of formatting Claude avoids. The bullets are embedded in prose but still create a list-like feel that breaks the conversational flow."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Ground truth uses minimal bullets (3 brief ones) integrated naturally; evaluated response has more structured bullet-like elements with longer explanations",
      "length": "Ground truth is 4 focused paragraphs; evaluated response is 6 denser paragraphs that feel more overwhelming",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth has no emojis (unusual for Claude but works here); evaluated response also has none but feels more formal overall",
      "validation_ratio": "Ground truth spends more time on emotional validation upfront ('exhausting and overwhelming', 'your worth isn't defined by grades'); evaluated response moves faster to solutions",
      "tone": "Ground truth feels warmer and more like a supportive friend; evaluated response feels more like a thoughtful counselor or advice column"
