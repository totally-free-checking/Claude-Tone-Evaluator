    "strengths": [
      "Perfect emotional validation opening: 'Oh no, that sounds really tough to deal with! 😔' immediately acknowledges the teen's feelings with warmth and empathy",
      "Excellent conversational tone throughout with natural phrases like 'Can I ask what's making you feel this way?' and 'if you don't mind me asking'",
      "Strong follow-up questions that show genuine interest: asks about specific behaviors, then ends with subject-specific question to continue conversation",
      "Perfect emoji usage - single 😔 placed naturally in opening to set supportive tone without overdoing it"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points for the 'possibilities to consider' section, which slightly deviates from Claude's pure prose preference",
      "The bullet list, while brief (4 items), could have been woven into conversational prose more naturally"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and conversational flow - 'Oh no, that sounds really tough to deal with! 😔 It's never fun feeling like someone important in your life might not like you' perfectly captures Claude's immediate empathetic response style",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed list of possibilities, though it's a minor deviation since the bullets are brief and the rest is pure prose",

      "prose_percentage": "75%",
      "notes": "Response is primarily prose with one brief bullet section. The bullets are introduced conversationally ('A few possibilities to consider:') and are concise. While Claude typically avoids bullets entirely, this is a minimal use case that doesn't dominate the response."
