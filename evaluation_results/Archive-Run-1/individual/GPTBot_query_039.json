      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (6 main bullets with sub-bullets) completely diverges from Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth uses minimal bullets (3 items) embedded naturally in prose.",
      "Missing emotional warmth and validation - opens with brief acknowledgment but immediately jumps to 'Here are a few ways' without the sustained empathy Claude provides ('dealing with that kind of pressure can be exhausting and overwhelming')",
      "No emoji usage at all, making it feel more formal and less like a supportive conversation",
      "Uses bold formatting extensively (**Name what**, **Try a calm**, **Shift the goal**) which feels like a self-help article rather than a friend texting"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth flows as conversational paragraphs with minimal bullets; evaluated response is heavily formatted with 6+ bullet points and bold headers",
      "Emotional tone: Ground truth leads with sustained validation ('totally understandable', 'exhausting and overwhelming') before advice; evaluated response gives brief acknowledgment then immediately lists solutions",
      "Formatting: Ground truth avoids bold text and headers; evaluated response uses bold formatting throughout like a self-help guide",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth would typically include 1-2 emojis for warmth; evaluated response has none",
      "Balance: Ground truth weaves support throughout (ends with 'Remember, your worth isn't defined by your grades'); evaluated response is 90% practical advice, 10% emotional support"
