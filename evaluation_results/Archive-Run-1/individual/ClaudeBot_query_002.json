    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable phrases like 'I completely forgot about the assignment. That's on me. Can I turn it in by ___?' - this is concrete and immediately usable",
      "Strong prose formatting throughout - no bullet points, advice flows naturally within paragraphs, maintains conversational structure",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific and offers continued help: 'If you tell me what subject it is and when it's due/was due, I can help you draft a message'",
      "Realistic advice about reminder systems that acknowledges teen agency: 'set one reminder for start (not just due)'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with validation but it's quite muted and clinical ('That happens more often than people admit') compared to Claude's warm, immediate empathy ('Oof, that's such a relatable moment! 😅')",
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes the tone feel more formal and less like a supportive friend texting",
      "Jumps too quickly into solution mode without enough emotional acknowledgment - the phrase 'it's usually fixable if you handle it cleanly' is practical but lacks warmth",
      "Language is somewhat formal in places ('handle it cleanly', 'pair it with a concrete plan') rather than fully conversational"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose-based formatting and natural flow of advice within paragraphs - this perfectly matches Claude's style of avoiding bullet points and maintaining conversational structure",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the relatively cold opening that jumps quickly to solutions rather than leading with warm validation and empathy",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent adherence to prose format. All advice flows naturally within paragraphs without any bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. This is a key strength that matches Claude's character perfectly."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "emotional_tone": "Ground truth opens with 'Oof, that's such a relatable moment! 😅' - immediate warmth and validation. Evaluated response opens with 'That happens more often than people admit, and it's usually fixable' - more clinical and solution-focused",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth uses 😅 naturally in the opening. Evaluated response has zero emojis, making it feel less casual and friendly",
      "validation_depth": "Ground truth explicitly validates the feeling ('that sinking feeling when you realize you completely spaced') before solutions. Evaluated response acknowledges it happens but doesn't validate the emotional experience",
      "reassurance": "Ground truth includes explicit reassurance ('Don't stress too much though - one forgotten assignment isn't the end of the world!'). Evaluated response lacks this comforting element",
      "structure": "Ground truth uses bullet points for options (though this is actually a weakness in Claude's response based on the character profile). Evaluated response maintains pure prose throughout, which is actually MORE aligned with the character description"
