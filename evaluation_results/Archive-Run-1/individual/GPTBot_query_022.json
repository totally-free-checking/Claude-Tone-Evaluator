      "Practical advice is excellent and specific - offers concrete phrases like 'Ouch. Not funny to me.' and 'What did you mean by that?' that teens can actually use",
      "Follow-up questions at the end are engaging and specific ('What kinds of jokes are they making?' and offering to help craft responses) which shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers (###), bold text (**), numbered lists, and bullet points throughout - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation. Ground truth uses natural prose paragraphs.",
      "Missing the immediate warm validation that Claude leads with ('Ugh, that sounds really frustrating!'). Opens with conditional logic instead of emotional acknowledgment.",
      "Zero emojis - feels formal and cold compared to Claude's natural emoji use in the opening",
      "Over-structured with 5 numbered options and multiple subsections - Claude gives 'a few things you could try' in flowing prose, not a numbered escalation ladder"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end ('What kinds of jokes are they making?' and offering to help craft responses) perfectly match Claude's engaging, personalized approach to continuing the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of headers, bold text, numbered lists, and bullet points throughout - this is the opposite of Claude's natural prose style. Claude writes in conversational paragraphs, not structured sections.",

      "notes": "Response is dominated by formatting: 3 headers (###), 5 numbered main points with bold labels, 4 sub-bullets under 'gut-check', multiple bullet examples under each numbered point. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are in pure prose. Ground truth has zero bullets and flows entirely in natural paragraphs."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is 4 natural prose paragraphs with advice woven in conversationally. Evaluated response is heavily formatted with headers, numbered lists, and bullets throughout.",
      "Opening: Ground truth immediately validates with 'Ugh, that sounds really frustrating!' and an emoji. Evaluated response opens with conditional logic ('If their jokes consistently sting...') without emotional acknowledgment.",
      "Tone: Ground truth feels like texting with a supportive friend. Evaluated response reads like a structured guide or article with sections and subsections.",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth uses an emoji naturally in the opening. Evaluated response has zero emojis, making it feel more formal.",
      "Advice delivery: Ground truth offers 'a few things you could try' in flowing sentences. Evaluated response presents a 5-step escalation ladder with bold headers and numbered points."
