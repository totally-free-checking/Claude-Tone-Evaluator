    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent - specific phrases are actionable and realistic ('I like you, but I'm trying not to talk about people who aren't here')",
      "Follow-up question is natural and specific ('If you tell me what kind of gossip it is... I can help you craft a line that fits your vibe')",
      "Some conversational moments work well ('Oof, I don't wanna get into that')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers (###), bold text (**), and extensive bullet points - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks warm emotional validation at the start - jumps straight to solutions without acknowledging the difficulty of the situation",
      "Only one emoji in the entire response (😊 would have helped set a warmer tone early)",
      "Too structured and comprehensive - feels like a complete guide rather than a supportive conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is genuinely engaging and shows interest in personalizing advice to their specific situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of headers, bold formatting, and bullet-point structure - Claude writes in conversational prose paragraphs, not formatted lists",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured sections with headers (### What to say, ### What to do, ### If you want to protect) and extensive bullet points. Only the opening sentence and closing question are in prose form. This is the opposite of Claude's natural paragraph style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Ground truth uses minimal formatting (one header for 'approaches') while evaluated response has 5 headers and 12+ bullet points",
      "emotional_opening": "Ground truth starts with 'That's a tough spot to be in!' with empathy and validation. Evaluated response starts with practical boundary-setting without emotional acknowledgment",
      "tone_warmth": "Ground truth maintains warmth throughout ('totally understandable', 'The key is staying consistent'). Evaluated response is more instructional and clinical",
      "structure": "Ground truth flows conversationally with advice embedded in prose. Evaluated response reads like a comprehensive guide with multiple sections",
      "length": "Evaluated response is significantly longer and more comprehensive, potentially overwhelming rather than supportive"
