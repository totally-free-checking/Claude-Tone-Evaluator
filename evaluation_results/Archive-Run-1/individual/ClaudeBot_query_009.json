    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent and specific - offers concrete phrases like 'I noticed things feel a little off since you checked my phone. Did you see something that worried you?' which is immediately actionable",
      "Shows sophisticated understanding of parent-teen dynamics and offers strategic framing ('Were you worried about me?' vs arguing about privacy) that's genuinely helpful"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks warmth and emotional validation - jumps straight into analysis mode without acknowledging the teen's feelings ('Oh no, that's always an awkward situation!' vs 'That's an uncomfortable position')",
      "No emojis at all, making it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 😅 that immediately sets a supportive tone",
      "Heavy use of bullet-like structure ('A few things might be happening...', 'They might be...', 'Or they might...') and parenthetical lists that read like an article rather than a conversation",
      "Way too long and dense - feels overwhelming rather than supportive, like reading a guide rather than getting advice from a friend"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality and specific phrases to use are excellent and match Claude's actionable approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of warmth, validation, and emojis at the start - Claude immediately validates with 'Oh no, that's always an awkward situation! 😅' while this response opens with clinical analysis",

      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "While not using explicit bullet points, the response has bullet-like structure with 'A few things might be happening' followed by three 'might be' statements, and extensive use of parenthetical lists (safety, sexual stuff, substances, etc.) that break up the prose flow. The paragraph structure feels more like sections of an article than natural conversation."

      "structure": "Claude: Natural prose with one brief bullet section vs Response: Dense analytical paragraphs with embedded lists and parentheticals",
      "tone": "Claude: Conversational friend ('totally normal', 'elephant in the room') vs Response: Strategic advisor ('most effective move', 'you'll get further if')",
