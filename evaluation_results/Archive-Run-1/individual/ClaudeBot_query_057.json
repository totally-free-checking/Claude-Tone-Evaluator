    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent and specific - 'write down what happened while it's fresh: the timeline, who was there, what was said' is concrete and actionable",
      "Follow-up question is natural and inviting - 'If you tell me what they said you did and what actually happened (even just the short version), I can help you figure out the strongest way to explain it' shows genuine interest and offers continued support"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with validation but immediately pivots to problem-solving mode without sitting with the teen's frustration - Claude says 'Ugh, that's so frustrating! There's nothing worse than...' and asks what happened first, while this response jumps to 'If you want to deal with it in a way that actually has a chance of changing something'",
      "Completely lacks emojis - Claude uses natural emojis to set a warm tone, this response has zero emotional markers and feels more like a legal brief than a supportive conversation",
      "Heavy reliance on structured advice formatting - uses em-dashes, colons, and complex sentence structures that read more like an adult guide than a casual conversation. Claude's response flows naturally in simple paragraphs",
      "The tone is more 'strategic advisor' than 'supportive friend' - phrases like 'forces the conversation onto specifics' and 'vibe-based argument' feel calculated rather than empathetic"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end that invites the teen to share more details and offers specific help with their situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The immediate pivot to strategic problem-solving without sitting with the emotional frustration first, combined with the complete absence of emojis and the overly structured, adult-oriented advice format",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically in prose format, the writing uses heavy punctuation (em-dashes, colons) and complex nested clauses that create a structured, list-like feel even without actual bullets. The second paragraph essentially functions as a multi-step guide disguised as prose."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude validates first and asks what happened before offering any advice; this response validates briefly then immediately launches into solution mode",
      "Claude uses warm, casual language ('Ugh', 'There's nothing worse', 'what actually went down') and an emoji; this response uses formal, strategic language ('applied correctly', 'consequence was reasonable', 'vibe-based argument')",
      "Claude's response is short, focused on understanding the situation first, and ends with an invitation to vent; this response is long, advice-heavy, and reads like a strategic guide to appealing a detention",
      "Claude's tone is 'I'm here to listen and support you'; this response's tone is 'Here's how to build a case and navigate the system'"
