    "strengths": [
      "Strong practical advice with specific phrases to use ('Stop joking about fighting me. I don't like it. Don't bring it up again.')",
      "Good follow-up questions at the end that show genuine interest and attempt to tailor advice ('Is this happening at work, school, or in a social/family situation')",
      "Validates the seriousness of the situation upfront ('That's not a joke if it keeps going after you've stopped finding it funny—at that point it's intimidation')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with numbered headers (### 1), ### 2), etc.) and multiple bullet points throughout - reads like a safety manual rather than a conversation",
      "Completely lacks emojis, making it feel cold and formal despite the serious topic",
      "Jumps almost immediately into solutions with minimal emotional validation - no 'That sounds really frustrating' or 'honestly pretty uncomfortable' warmth",
      "Way too long and overwhelming (5 major sections with subsections) - would be exhausting to read on a phone"

    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation ('That's not a joke if it keeps going after you've stopped finding it funny—at that point it's intimidation') captures Claude's direct, validating approach to naming the problem",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of numbered headers, multiple bullet point sections, and structured formatting (### 1), ### 2), etc.) - this is the opposite of Claude's natural prose style",
