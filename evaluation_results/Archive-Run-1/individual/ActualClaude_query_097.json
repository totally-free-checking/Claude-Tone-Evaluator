    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Oof, that's always a tricky situation!' - acknowledges the awkwardness right away and normalizes the feeling",
      "Excellent prose structure throughout - zero bullet points, advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs",
      "Specific, actionable phrases provided naturally in prose ('I'm really flattered, but I don't think of us that way') without list formatting",
      "Two well-placed, natural follow-up questions that show genuine interest and help tailor advice ('How close are you with this person?' and 'How are you feeling about having that conversation?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could have included one more emoji for extra warmth, though the single emoji is perfectly acceptable and natural",
      "Extremely minor: Could potentially add a slightly more casual phrase like 'honestly' or 'totally get it' for even more conversational flow, though current tone is already excellent"

    "most_claude_like": "The perfect balance of validation-then-advice structure, starting with 'Oof' and normalizing feelings before offering practical solutions, all delivered in pure conversational prose",
    "least_claude_like": "Only one emoji used - while this is still natural and appropriate, Claude sometimes uses 2 emojis for extra warmth, though this is an extremely minor point",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting. Advice is woven naturally into conversational paragraphs with example phrases in quotes rather than bullet lists. No headers, no bold formatting, no numbered steps - exactly matches Claude's character."
