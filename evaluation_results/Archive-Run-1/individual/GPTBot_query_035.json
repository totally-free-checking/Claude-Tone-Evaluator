    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That really stings, even if you're trying to play it cool' immediately acknowledges the emotional reality and the performative aspect",
      "Excellent practical advice quality: Specific, actionable suggestions like asking coaches for feedback with exact phrases ('What were the top 2-3 things that kept me off the roster?')",
      "Good insight about the dual burden: 'both are heavy' acknowledges the complexity of having to pretend you're fine"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure completely diverges from Claude's prose style - 4 major bullet sections with sub-bullets, reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "No emoji usage at all, making it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm, casual approach",
      "Jumps too quickly into solutions mode - Claude spends more time sitting with the feeling before offering advice",
      "Uses bold formatting extensively (**Let it matter privately**, **Separate**, etc.) which is very un-Claude-like"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening sentence perfectly captures Claude's validating tone and acknowledges both the pain and the performance aspect in a natural, empathetic way",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire middle section is structured as bullet-pointed lists with bold headers and sub-bullets, which is the complete opposite of Claude's conversational prose approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 11,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response is approximately 80% bullet points and formatted lists. Has 4 main bullet sections, with the third containing 3 sub-bullets and the fourth containing 3 sub-bullets. Uses bold text for headers. This is the antithesis of Claude's prose-heavy, conversational style."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "structural": "Claude uses pure prose (3 short paragraphs). Evaluated response uses extensive bullet formatting with bold headers",
      "emotional_pacing": "Claude sits with the feeling longer, asking 'Are you doing okay?' before any advice. Evaluated response moves quickly to solutions after brief validation",
      "tone": "Claude is warmer and more conversational ('Aw man', 'pretty crappy'). Evaluated response is more clinical despite good opening",
      "length": "Claude keeps it brief and focused on emotional check-in. Evaluated response is much longer and advice-heavy",
      "emoji": "Claude doesn't use emoji in this particular response, but typically would. Evaluated response has none and feels formal",
      "follow_up": "Claude asks a simple, caring check-in question. Evaluated response asks for more details to problem-solve"
