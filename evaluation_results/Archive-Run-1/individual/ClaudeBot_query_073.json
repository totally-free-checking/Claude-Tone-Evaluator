    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific phrases to use: 'I've noticed a lot of our conversations end up feeling competitive' and 'I'm not really comparing. I'm just telling you what happened' - these are concrete and actionable",
      "Strong conversational tone in places like 'That doesn't make it pleasant for you' and 'If they're a decent friend' - feels natural and relatable",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific to the situation: 'do they get competitive mainly with you, or with everyone?' shows genuine interest in understanding the dynamic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points for advice ('What tends to work best is naming it...') which breaks from Claude's pure prose style. Ground truth integrates advice naturally: 'A few things that might help:' followed by dashes, but still more conversational",
      "Missing emojis entirely - Claude uses 😅 or similar to set a warm, casual tone early. This makes the response feel more formal and less like texting with a friend",
      "Weak opening validation - 'That can get exhausting' is okay but lacks Claude's immediate warmth and relatability. Compare to ground truth's 'Ugh, that sounds exhausting! It's like you can't even mention grabbing a coffee...' which paints a vivid, relatable picture",
      "Too much psychological explanation ('competition is how they learned to connect or feel secure') before emotional validation - feels more like a therapy session than a supportive friend"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The specific dialogue examples and phrases to use are excellent and very Claude-like - giving teens exact words they can say is a hallmark of Claude's practical approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the immediate dive into psychological analysis ('A lot of people do this because...') rather than starting with warm, relatable validation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points, the response has a structured, almost clinical flow with clear sections (explanation → advice → boundary-setting → question). Ground truth feels more conversational throughout with advice woven naturally into the flow. The parenthetical asides '(not right after they've one-upped you)' and '(and you can answer briefly)' add conversational flavor but also feel slightly formal."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth opens with immediate, vivid validation ('Ugh, that sounds exhausting! It's like you can't even mention grabbing a coffee...') while evaluated response opens with mild acknowledgment then jumps to psychological explanation",
      "Ground truth uses an emoji and maintains warm, casual tone throughout. Evaluated response has no emojis and feels more like advice from a counselor than a friend",
      "Ground truth keeps advice brief and integrated naturally ('Call it out gently when it happens: \"Dude, we're just chatting, not keeping score!\"'). Evaluated response is longer and more instructional",
      "Ground truth asks two related questions at the end to continue conversation naturally. Evaluated response asks one question with a parenthetical instruction '(and you can answer briefly)' which feels slightly controlling"
