    "strengths": [
      "Perfect emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's SO frustrating!' - immediately validates feelings and uses natural, emphatic language",
      "Excellent follow-up questions that are specific and show genuine interest: 'What kind of stuff are they going through? Is it just general snooping or are they looking for something particular?'",
      "Natural conversational tone throughout with contractions and casual phrasing ('though honestly, they probably should know better')",
      "Strong balance of validation and practical advice - starts with empathy, moves to solutions, ends with engagement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Contains bullet points for advice delivery ('A few ideas that might help:' followed by 4 bullets) - this is a key deviation from Claude's prose-heavy character",
      "Complete absence of emojis - Claude typically uses 1-2 emojis naturally, often early in the response to set a warm tone",
      "The bullet point structure makes it feel more like a formatted list than a natural conversation flow"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and conversational tone are perfect - 'Ugh, that's SO frustrating! Having your privacy invaded like that would drive anyone up the wall' captures Claude's immediate empathy and natural language beautifully",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed advice section ('A few ideas that might help:' with 4 bullets) - Claude would integrate these suggestions into prose paragraphs rather than listing them out",

      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response has strong prose opening and closing, but the middle section uses a bullet list format. The intro 'A few ideas that might help:' followed by 4 bulleted suggestions is the primary formatting issue. Claude would weave these suggestions into conversational paragraphs instead."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "This IS the ground truth response - it's identical word-for-word",
      "note": "This response is actually Claude's ground truth response, so the evaluation reveals that even Claude's own responses sometimes use bullet points, though this goes against the stated character profile of being 'prose-heavy' and avoiding bullets. The main deviation from the ideal character profile is the bullet point usage and lack of emojis."
