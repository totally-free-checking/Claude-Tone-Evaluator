    "strengths": [
      "Perfect opening validation with 'Ugh, that's such an awkward situation!' - immediately acknowledges the discomfort and validates the teen's feelings",
      "Excellent conversational tone throughout with natural phrases like 'you're just not feeling the connection' and 'Sometimes people get the hint and back off naturally'",
      "Outstanding follow-up question that's specific and engaging: 'Is there something specific about the situation that's making it extra uncomfortable? Like are they being pushy or just... not picking up on social cues?' - shows genuine interest and invites further conversation",
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable with specific strategies like 'Be \"busy\" when they suggest plans' and 'Gradually reduce your responses to texts/messages'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points for the advice section, which slightly deviates from Claude's preference for pure prose formatting - though this is the actual ground truth response",
      "Could have included one more emoji (perhaps 😅 after the opening or in the middle) to enhance the warm, casual tone, though the single 'Ugh' works well"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The entire response structure and tone - from immediate validation ('Ugh, that's such an awkward situation!'), through balanced practical advice, to the engaging two-part follow-up question that shows genuine curiosity about their specific situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet point formatting in the middle section, though this is actually minimal and the bullets are integrated naturally within the conversational flow",

      "notes": "Response uses bullets for the practical advice section but bookends them with strong prose paragraphs. The bullets are concise and don't feel overly formatted - no headers, bold text, or numbering. The prose sections (opening validation and closing reflection/question) are substantial and conversational."
