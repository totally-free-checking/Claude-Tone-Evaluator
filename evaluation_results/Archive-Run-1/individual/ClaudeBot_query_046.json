    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting - maintains conversational paragraphs throughout with zero bullet points, matching Claude's natural flow style",
      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable suggestions like 'I can't help with that today, but I hope it goes okay' - gives exact phrases the teen can use",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific and relevant: 'when they reach out, what are they usually asking for—and do you ever get the sense they're interested in your life when there isn't a request involved?'",
      "Validates the feeling immediately with 'That's a really painful feeling' and acknowledges the emotional impact"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's natural style (Claude used none here either, but typically includes 1-2)",
      "Significantly longer than Claude's response (5 paragraphs vs 4, much denser text) - feels more like an article than a conversation, potentially overwhelming on a phone",
      "More clinical/analytical language ('transactional', 'emotional labor', 'emotional cost') - less casual than Claude's 'tough when relationships feel one-sided'",
      "The tone is more therapist-like and instructional ('A practical way to test', 'If these are friends you want to keep') rather than friend-to-friend casual"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The pure prose formatting without any bullet points or lists - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs exactly as Claude does",
    "least_claude_like": "The overall tone is more analytical and instructional rather than warmly conversational - uses phrases like 'emotional labor' and 'emotional cost' that feel more adult/clinical than teen-friendly",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting - no bullets, no numbered lists, no headers. Advice is woven naturally into paragraphs. This matches Claude's style exactly."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "length": "Response is significantly longer (5 dense paragraphs vs 4 shorter ones) - Claude's is more concise and digestible",
      "language_complexity": "Uses more sophisticated vocabulary ('transactional', 'malicious', 'emotional labor') vs Claude's simpler, more direct language",
      "tone": "More instructional/therapeutic ('A practical way to test', 'If these are friends you want to keep') vs Claude's more peer-like approach",
      "structure": "Provides more comprehensive advice upfront vs Claude's lighter touch with more back-and-forth invitation",
      "emoji_absence": "Both lack emojis, but Claude typically includes 1-2 for warmth - this response feels more formal without them"
