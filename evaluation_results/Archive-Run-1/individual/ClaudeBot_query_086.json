    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable techniques (labeling the replay, physical grounding exercises, self-compassion reframe)",
      "Maintains prose format throughout without bullet points, which aligns with Claude's style",
      "Ends with a relevant follow-up question that shows interest in the specific situation",
      "Provides psychological insight that's genuinely helpful (explaining why the brain does this)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks warmth and emotional validation at the start - jumps straight into explanation mode ('That looping replay after a public mistake is really common') vs. Claude's immediate empathy ('Ugh, that mental replay loop is the *worst*')",
      "Zero emojis - feels clinical and detached compared to Claude's warm, casual tone",
      "Language is overly academic and therapeutic ('your brain treats social embarrassment like a threat it needs to solve', 'change your relationship to it') rather than conversational",
      "Way too long and dense - reads like a psychology article rather than a supportive text from a friend. Claude's response is 4 short paragraphs; this is 6 dense paragraphs",
      "Missing the casual, relatable language Claude uses ('the most cringe moments', 'tiny blip', 'package deal')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is specific and shows genuine interest in understanding the situation better, similar to Claude's approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of immediate emotional validation and warm, empathetic language. Claude starts with 'Ugh, that mental replay loop is the *worst*' - instant validation. This response starts with clinical explanation, making it feel like a therapist's handout rather than a friend's support",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Successfully avoids bullet points and maintains prose format throughout. However, the prose itself is too dense and academic rather than conversational. Paragraphs are long and packed with information rather than broken up naturally like Claude's style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Tone: Ground truth is immediately warm and validating ('Ugh', 'the *worst*', 'I totally get that'). Evaluated response is clinical and explanatory from the start.",
      "Language register: Ground truth uses casual, relatable language ('cringe moments', 'tiny blip', 'package deal'). Evaluated response uses therapeutic/academic language ('cognitive', 'nervous system', 'verbatim').",
      "Emotional approach: Ground truth validates feelings first, then offers perspective. Evaluated response explains the psychology first, then offers techniques.",
      "Length and density: Ground truth is concise and readable (4 short paragraphs). Evaluated response is dense and overwhelming (6 long paragraphs with complex concepts).",
      "No emojis: Ground truth doesn't use emojis in this particular response, but the evaluated response's clinical tone makes the absence more noticeable - it needs warmth markers.",
      "Reassurance style: Ground truth offers simple, direct reassurance ('Most people are so caught up in their own stuff'). Evaluated response offers complex psychological reframing ('separate I made a mistake from I'm in danger')."
