    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent - very specific, actionable strategies like 'I've noticed you've been stricter about ___ lately. Can you help me understand what changed?' gives concrete phrases the teen can actually use",
      "Shows understanding of parent psychology ('control is how they cope', 'parents respond well to structure') which helps the teen understand the situation better"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons Claude's prose-based conversational style in favor of a heavily structured, bullet-pointed format with numbered sections and bold headers - reads like a self-help article, not a supportive conversation",
      "Opens with minimal emotional validation ('That's frustrating, especially when it feels random or unfair') then immediately jumps into structured advice without the warm, empathetic tone Claude establishes first",
      "Zero emojis throughout the entire response - makes it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm, casual approach with natural emoji use",
      "The phrase 'A few things that often help (without turning it into a fight):' followed by numbered bullets is the exact opposite of Claude's natural conversational flow"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end ('If you tell me what they're being strict about...and your age') shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation and getting specifics",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire formatting structure - 5 numbered sections with bold headers and multiple sub-bullets is completely antithetical to Claude's natural prose style. This reads like a WikiHow article, not a supportive friend",

      "notes": "Response is approximately 85% structured lists with 5 main numbered sections, each containing multiple sub-bullets. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are in prose form. This is the complete opposite of Claude's approach, which uses pure prose with zero or minimal bullets."

      "formatting": "Ground truth uses 4 natural paragraphs with conversational flow. Evaluated response uses 5 numbered sections with 18+ bullet points and bold headers",
      "emotional_opening": "Ground truth opens with strong validation ('That sounds really frustrating! It's tough when...') and dedicates entire first paragraph to empathy. Evaluated response has one brief sentence then jumps to advice",
      "tone": "Ground truth feels like texting with a supportive friend. Evaluated response feels like reading a structured guide or article",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth would typically include 1-2 emojis. Evaluated response has zero",
      "advice_delivery": "Ground truth weaves advice naturally into conversational paragraphs. Evaluated response presents advice as a structured checklist",
