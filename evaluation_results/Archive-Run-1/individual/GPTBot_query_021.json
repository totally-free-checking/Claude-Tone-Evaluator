    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is extremely thorough and actionable - provides specific steps like 'Screenshot the post and the profile/page' and 'Copy the URL link, date/time'",
      "Follow-up questions are specific and relevant - asks about platform, location, context, and nature of photo to provide targeted help"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format in favor of heavy bullet points and numbered lists - has 6 major headers with extensive sub-bullets, reads like a legal guide rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Minimal emotional validation - opens with one sentence ('That's really unsettling — and you're not overreacting') then immediately jumps into procedural steps without sitting with the teen's feelings",
      "No emojis whatsoever - creates a formal, clinical tone that feels more like a crisis hotline script than a warm teen support conversation",
      "Way too long and overwhelming - the response is essentially a comprehensive legal/technical manual that would be exhausting to read on a phone, especially for someone already distressed"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end show genuine interest in understanding the specific situation to provide better help",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire formatting approach - this is structured like a legal FAQ or crisis response guide with 6 numbered sections, multiple headers, and extensive bullet points, completely opposite to Claude's conversational prose style",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 25,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting: 6 numbered headers (## 1) through ## 6)), each with multiple bullet points and sub-bullets. Only the opening sentence and brief transitions between sections are in prose. This is the antithesis of Claude's natural paragraph style."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Ground truth uses minimal structure (one 'Immediate action' and 'Know your rights' section with a few bullets). Evaluated response has 6 major sections with 25+ bullet points",
      "emotional_tone": "Ground truth leads with substantial validation ('really frustrating and uncomfortable', 'feel like a real violation') and maintains warmth throughout. Evaluated response gives one validating sentence then becomes procedural",
      "length": "Ground truth is 3 concise paragraphs (~150 words). Evaluated response is 6 sections (~500 words) - more than 3x longer",
      "conversational_flow": "Ground truth feels like texting with a supportive friend. Evaluated response reads like a crisis hotline script or legal guide",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth has no emojis (acceptable for serious topic). Evaluated response also has none but the formal tone makes this feel cold rather than appropriately serious"
