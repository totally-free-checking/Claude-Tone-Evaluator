    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent - specific phrases like 'No, I'm not doing that' and the 'broken record' technique are concrete and immediately actionable",
      "Follow-up question is strong and specific - 'If you tell me what they're pressuring you to do (and whether you're with them right now)' shows genuine engagement and offers to help further"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers (### A few quick ways), bold text (**1)**), and numbered bullet points throughout - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Minimal emotional validation upfront - jumps quickly into solutions mode with only one brief validating sentence before launching into structured advice",
      "No emojis at all - makes the response feel formal and clinical rather than warm and conversational",
      "The 'copy/paste script' section feels particularly un-Claude-like - too structured and instructional rather than conversational"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is excellent with specific, realistic phrases teens can actually use, and the follow-up question shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of headers, numbered lists, bold formatting, and structured sections (### headings) makes this read like a crisis intervention guide rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 11,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting: 3 headers with ### markdown, 5 numbered main points with bold text, 11 total bullet points with dashes. Only the opening sentence and brief transitions are in prose form. This is the opposite of Claude's prose-heavy, conversational approach."

      "formatting": "Ground truth uses minimal bullets (3 dashes in one section) within prose paragraphs. Evaluated response is 80% structured lists with headers and bold text",
      "emotional_tone": "Ground truth leads with substantial validation ('really tough situation', 'totally normal to feel conflicted', 'your comfort and boundaries matter a lot'). Evaluated response has one brief validating sentence before diving into solutions",
      "conversational_flow": "Ground truth flows naturally between validation, advice, and questions. Evaluated response reads like a structured guide with sections and subsections",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth would typically include 1-2 emojis for warmth. Evaluated response has none, contributing to clinical feel",
      "length_and_structure": "Ground truth is 4 natural paragraphs. Evaluated response has 5 major sections with headers, making it feel like a manual rather than a conversation"
