    "strengths": [
      "Strong prose formatting - maintains paragraph structure throughout without bullet points, which aligns with Claude's style",
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable ('narrowing priorities, asking for help, renegotiating a deadline') with specific examples",
      "Does validate the feeling initially with 'That feeling can be really heavy' and uses relatable metaphor about the scoreboard",
      "Includes thoughtful follow-up questions about specific areas and safety check-in"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes it feel too formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm, casual approach (Claude would likely use 😔 or similar)",
      "Language is overly academic and complex ('sustainably carry', 'fixed, heroic gear', 'concrete terms') - doesn't sound like texting with a supportive friend",
      "Way too long and dense - this is overwhelming to read on a phone, especially for someone already feeling exhausted. Claude's response is 3 short paragraphs; this is 5 dense ones",
      "Jumps too quickly into analytical mode ('A few things tend to be true at the same time') rather than sitting with the emotion first like Claude does",
      "The 'reality check' exercise feels therapeutic/clinical rather than conversational",
      "Opening validation is weaker than Claude's - 'really tough and exhausting' hits harder than 'can be really heavy'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose formatting and avoidance of bullet points - this response maintains conversational paragraph flow throughout, which is a key Claude characteristic",
    "least_claude_like": "The overly analytical, academic tone with complex vocabulary and therapeutic framing - reads like a counselor's response rather than a warm, casual conversation with a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting with no bullet points. However, the prose itself is too dense and academic rather than conversational and natural."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude's response is warm and concise (3 short paragraphs); evaluated response is lengthy and overwhelming (5 dense paragraphs)",
      "Claude uses simple, natural language ('really tough and exhausting', 'disheartening'); evaluated response uses complex vocabulary ('sustainably carry', 'fixed, heroic gear')",
      "Claude asks one clear, focused question to understand the situation; evaluated response asks multiple questions and includes a safety check that feels clinical",
      "Claude includes an emoji-appropriate moment but evaluated response has zero emojis, making it feel too formal",
      "Claude sits with the emotion longer before offering perspective; evaluated response quickly shifts to analytical mode",
      "Claude's tone feels like a caring friend; evaluated response feels like a therapist or life coach"
