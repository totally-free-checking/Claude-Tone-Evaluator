    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Ugh, that sounds really frustrating!' - captures the feeling instantly and empathetically",
      "Excellent conversational flow with natural phrases like 'right?', 'pretty suffocating', and 'Either way though' that feel authentic",
      "Beautiful balance of validation ('your feelings are totally valid') followed by gentle exploration of the friend's perspective, then practical next steps",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and shows understanding of potential social awkwardness teens face"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could have included 1-2 emojis to enhance the warm, casual tone (typically Claude uses 😅 or similar in the opening)",
      "While the advice about having a conversation is good, it could have been slightly more specific with a suggested phrase or approach"

    "least_claude_like": "The absence of emojis is the only notable divergence - Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis, often in the opening paragraph to set a warm tone",
