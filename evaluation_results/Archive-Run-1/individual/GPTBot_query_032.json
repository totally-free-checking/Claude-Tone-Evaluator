    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is highly specific and actionable - provides actual copy/paste phrases like 'Hey, I've noticed you've seemed a bit distant lately. Did I do something that upset you?' which is exactly what teens need",
      "Follow-up question at the end is engaging and specific: 'If you tell me what changed (texts, in person, coworker/friend/partner, and any moment you suspect triggered it), I can help you choose the best wording and timing' - shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format in favor of heavy bullet points and numbered lists - has 5 numbered sections with multiple sub-bullets, headers, and formatting that reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Opens with validation but immediately pivots to a structured list format without maintaining the warm, conversational flow - the first paragraph is good but then it becomes a checklist",
      "Zero emojis throughout the entire response - makes it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable situation!' opening",
      "Uses headers like '### 1) Do a quick reality check' and bold formatting throughout, which is the opposite of Claude's natural prose style"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening line 'That \"they seem mad but won't say why\" feeling is really unsettling' captures some of Claude's validating tone, and the final follow-up question is genuinely engaging and specific to the situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire structural approach - this is formatted as a comprehensive guide with 5 numbered sections, multiple bullet points, headers, and bold text. Claude's response is 3 natural paragraphs with one small bullet list. This reads like a wiki article, not a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 20,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting: 5 main numbered sections with headers, approximately 20 bullet points total, bold text for emphasis, and 'Key tips' subsection. Only the opening paragraph and transitions between sections are in prose. Claude's ground truth has 3 bullets in one small list within otherwise pure prose - this response is the inverse of that approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Format: Claude uses 3 conversational paragraphs with one small 3-bullet list. Evaluated response uses 5 numbered sections with headers, multiple nested bullets, and heavy formatting",
      "Tone: Claude opens with 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable situation!' with emoji-like warmth. Evaluated response is more clinical despite good opening line",
      "Emoji usage: Claude uses natural conversational markers. Evaluated response has zero emojis, making it feel formal",
      "Length: Claude is concise (2-3 paragraphs). Evaluated response is much longer and more comprehensive, reading like a guide rather than a conversation",
      "Validation approach: Claude maintains warmth throughout ('The not-knowing part is probably the worst bit'). Evaluated response front-loads validation then becomes instructional"
