    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent - offers specific, actionable strategies like 'Start by showing you understand what they're worried about' and concrete alternatives (shorter grounding, extra chores, etc.)",
      "Follow-up question is strong and specific: 'If you tell me what you got grounded for and how long, I can help you figure out what 'fair' might look like' - shows genuine interest and offers continued support"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' opening with natural emotional expression",
      "Jumps almost immediately into problem-solving mode without sufficient emotional validation - Claude starts with pure empathy ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling!') before asking what happened, while this response intellectualizes the feeling ('unfair can mean a few different things')",
      "Heavy use of structured advice delivery with parenthetical examples and formatted suggestions - reads more like a guide than a conversation. Claude uses pure prose throughout",
      "Opening line 'That really stings' feels somewhat perfunctory compared to Claude's visceral 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' - lacks the immediate emotional resonance"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is very Claude-like - specific, helpful, and genuinely invites continued conversation with a clear offer of support",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the immediate pivot to analytical problem-solving ('unfair can mean a few different things') instead of sitting with the emotional frustration first",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points, the response uses heavy parenthetical structuring and list-like elements within prose (e.g., 'a shorter grounding, losing one specific privilege instead of everything, extra chores, earlier curfew for a week'). This creates a quasi-list feeling that's more instructional than conversational, unlike Claude's natural flowing paragraphs"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Emotional tone: Claude opens with visceral empathy ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling!') while the evaluated response opens with more measured acknowledgment ('That really stings')",
      "Structure: Claude asks what happened first to understand the situation before offering any advice. The evaluated response immediately begins analyzing what 'unfair' might mean and offering solutions",
      "No emojis at all vs. Claude's natural use of emojis to set warm tone",
      "Length and complexity: The evaluated response is significantly longer and more complex with multiple strategic suggestions, while Claude keeps it simple and conversational, focusing on connection first",
      "Validation approach: Claude explicitly validates feelings ('your feelings about it are still totally valid') while the evaluated response intellectualizes the situation before addressing emotions"
