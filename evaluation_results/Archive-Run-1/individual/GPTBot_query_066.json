      "Practical advice is specific and actionable - the physiological sigh technique and 5-4-3-2-1 grounding are concrete, realistic tools a teen can use immediately",
      "Shows appropriate concern with the safety check-in at the end, demonstrating genuine care for the user's wellbeing"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers, bold text, numbered lists, and bullet points throughout - reads like a clinical guide rather than a conversation. Ground truth uses minimal formatting and flows naturally in prose",
      "Opens with clinical language ('nervous system is stuck in high alert') instead of warm validation like ground truth's 'Oh man, that racing brain feeling is the worst!'",
      "Completely lacks emojis - feels formal and detached compared to ground truth's casual warmth",
      "The safety check feels jarring and overly formal at the end, breaking the conversational flow rather than being woven in naturally"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The acknowledgment that stress 'for no reason' is actually valid and common, though this is buried in the response rather than emphasized early like Claude does",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of headers, bold text, numbered lists, and bullet points - this is the opposite of Claude's natural prose approach. Ground truth has one simple list with minimal formatting; this response is structured like a self-help article",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by formatting: 3 headers, 4 numbered/bolded sections, multiple sub-bullets, and extensive use of bold text. Only the opening sentence and closing questions are in natural prose. Ground truth uses one simple list with 4 items and minimal bold text, with most content in conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is primarily prose with one simple list; evaluated response is heavily formatted with headers, numbers, and extensive bullets",
      "Opening tone: Ground truth immediately validates with 'Oh man, that racing brain feeling is the worst!' while evaluated response opens clinically with 'nervous system is stuck in high alert'",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth has none but maintains warmth through language; evaluated response also has none but feels clinical rather than warm",
      "Validation placement: Ground truth validates feelings early and throughout; evaluated response jumps straight to solutions with minimal emotional acknowledgment",
      "Question approach: Ground truth ends with one natural, engaging question about their current vibe; evaluated response has multiple clinical diagnostic questions plus a formal safety check",
      "Length and readability: Ground truth is concise and phone-friendly; evaluated response is longer and more overwhelming with its formatting"
