    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable scripts ('Hey, I've noticed our plans often get cancelled last minute...') that teens could actually use",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and relevant ('If you tell me whether they cancel with a real explanation and whether they reschedule on their own...')",
      "Thoughtful boundary-setting advice that empowers the teen without being preachy ('This isn't punishment—it's making the friendship sustainable')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with parenthetical list '(mental health, work, family stuff)' and uses multiple em-dashes and parentheticals throughout, creating a more structured/academic feel rather than conversational flow",
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes the response feel formal and less warm compared to Claude's 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' opening",
      "Jumps too quickly into analytical problem-solving mode without enough emotional validation upfront - Claude spends more time in the 'I hear you, this sucks' space before offering solutions",
      "Uses more formal/clinical language ('conflict‑avoidant', 'time‑sensitive plans', 'lower‑stakes hangouts') rather than Claude's casual phrasing"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is genuinely engaging and shows real interest in understanding the specific situation to give better advice, matching Claude's conversational approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the immediate dive into analytical problem-solving (listing possible reasons in parentheses) rather than starting with warm, empathetic validation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points, the response uses heavy parenthetical structuring and em-dashes that create a list-like feel in the first paragraph. The prose is more academic/analytical than conversational, with complex sentence structures that feel less natural than Claude's flowing paragraphs"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude opens with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and spends the first paragraph purely validating feelings. The evaluated response opens with validation but immediately pivots to analysis ('usually mean one of a few things')",
      "Claude uses casual, conversational language throughout ('flakey', 'your time matters too!') while the evaluated response uses more formal terminology ('conflict-avoidant', 'time-sensitive plans')",
      "Claude includes an emoji-like exclamation and maintains a lighter, more supportive tone. The evaluated response has no emojis and feels more like advice from a therapist than a friend",
      "Claude asks multiple simple, direct questions to understand the situation better. The evaluated response asks one complex conditional question at the end",
      "Claude's advice flows naturally within conversation ('Sometimes people don't realize...But also...your time matters too!'). The evaluated response structures advice more formally with clear sections (diagnosis, script, boundary-setting, interpretation)"
