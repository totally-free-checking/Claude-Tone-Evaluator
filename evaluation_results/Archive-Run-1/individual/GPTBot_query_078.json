      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable - provides specific phrases the teen could actually use ('I'm not really looking to make new friends right now')",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format in favor of heavy bullet points and numbered headers - reads like a self-help article, not a conversation. Ground truth uses minimal bullets naturally within prose.",
      "Zero emojis and no warmth in opening - starts with 'That's a tough spot' but immediately jumps to structured advice without the empathetic validation Claude provides ('Ugh, that's such an awkward situation!')",
      "Overly formal and structured with numbered sections (1-5) and bold headers - feels like a corporate training document rather than a supportive friend texting",
      "Way too long and overwhelming - 5 major sections with multiple subsections creates a wall of text that's exhausting to read on a phone, versus Claude's concise 2-3 paragraphs"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end ('If you tell me the context...') shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation and getting more specific details",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire formatting approach - numbered sections with headers and extensive bullet points is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose style. Ground truth has 4 simple bullets embedded in conversation; this has 15+ bullets across 5 structured sections.",

      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting: 5 numbered main sections with ### headers, multiple bold subheaders, and extensive bullet points throughout. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are prose. Ground truth uses 4 bullets naturally embedded within conversational paragraphs (approximately 60% prose)."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Format: Ground truth is conversational prose with 4 embedded bullets; evaluated response is a structured 5-section guide with 17+ bullets and headers",
      "Opening tone: Ground truth starts with 'Ugh, that's such an awkward situation!' (warm, validating, emoji); evaluated response starts with 'That's a tough spot' (acknowledgment but no warmth or emoji)",
      "Length: Ground truth is ~150 words in 3 short paragraphs; evaluated response is ~350 words in overwhelming structured format",
      "Emotional validation: Ground truth validates throughout ('It's tough when...', 'you don't have to force a friendship'); evaluated response jumps straight to strategic advice with minimal emotional support",
      "Tone: Ground truth feels like texting a supportive friend; evaluated response reads like a workplace conflict resolution manual"
