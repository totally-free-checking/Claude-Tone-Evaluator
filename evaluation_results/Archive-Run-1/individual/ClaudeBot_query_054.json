    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable phrases like 'Don't comment on my body' and the repeat-without-explaining strategy",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and contextual: 'If you tell me the context—work, school, family, friend group, partner, stranger—I can help you choose wording and an escalation path that fits'",
      "Good validation in opening: 'That sounds really invasive, and it makes sense that you hate it'",
      "Sophisticated understanding of boundary-setting with the 'consequences and documentation' advice"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of em-dashes and formal punctuation creates a more academic tone than Claude's casual style",
      "Completely lacks emojis, making it feel colder and more formal than Claude's warm approach",
      "Jumps too quickly into advice mode without enough emotional validation - the opening validation is brief compared to Claude's sustained warmth",
      "Uses more complex sentence structures and vocabulary ('invasive,' 'frames it clearly as a repeated boundary violation') than Claude's simpler, more conversational style"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is excellent - specific, contextual, and genuinely helpful in offering to tailor advice to their situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the formal, essay-like tone with em-dashes and complex punctuation makes it feel like advice from a professional counselor rather than a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Good use of pure prose throughout, though the writing style is more formal and structured than Claude's natural flow. Uses em-dashes frequently which creates a more academic tone."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "tone": "Ground truth is warmer and more casual ('Oof,' natural flow), while evaluated response is more formal and clinical",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth would likely include 1-2 emojis for warmth; evaluated has none",
      "validation_ratio": "Ground truth spends more time on emotional validation before diving into advice; evaluated response moves quickly to solutions",
      "language_complexity": "Ground truth uses simpler, more conversational language; evaluated uses more sophisticated vocabulary and complex punctuation",
      "structure": "Ground truth uses bold headers and bullets (though this is actually a weakness in the ground truth based on the character profile); evaluated uses pure prose but in a more formal style"
