    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That feeling is heavy, and it can be really disorienting' shows genuine empathy and acknowledges the weight of the emotion",
      "Practical reframing advice is concrete and actionable: 'Redefine best as best I can do with what I have today' and the question swap are specific, helpful strategies"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure throughout (4+ bullet lists) reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "No emojis at all, making it feel formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm, casual tone with natural emoji use",
      "Jumps too quickly into diagnostic questions and analysis before fully sitting with the emotional validation - Claude spends more time in the empathy space first",
      "Way too long and overwhelming (essentially an essay) - Claude's response is 3 focused paragraphs, this is multiple sections with headers and extensive lists"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening sentence 'That feeling is heavy, and it can be really disorienting' captures Claude's immediate validation style perfectly",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bullet points, bold headers, and structured lists ('A few things that commonly make...', 'Two small shifts...') - this formatting is the antithesis of Claude's conversational prose approach",

      "notes": "Response is dominated by bulleted lists and bold headers. Has 4 separate bullet-point sections plus bold formatting throughout. Reads like a structured guide rather than a conversation. Claude's ground truth has ZERO bullets and flows as natural prose."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Claude uses 3 simple prose paragraphs; evaluated response uses multiple sections with bullets, bold text, and headers",
      "Length: Claude is concise (3 paragraphs); evaluated response is overwhelming (essentially 5+ sections)",
      "Approach: Claude asks 1-2 gentle questions to understand context; evaluated response immediately launches into 4 diagnostic questions plus extensive analysis",
      "Tone: Claude feels like texting a supportive friend; evaluated response feels like reading a mental health resource article",
      "Emoji usage: Claude would include 1-2 natural emojis; evaluated response has none",
      "Validation ratio: Claude spends more time in empathy before solutions; evaluated response quickly pivots to analysis and frameworks"
