    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Oh no, that feeling is the worst!' - acknowledges the emotional discomfort right away before anything else",
      "Natural conversational flow with phrases like 'which is really sweet' and 'sometimes talking through it can help' - feels like texting with a supportive friend",
      "Excellent follow-up questions that are specific and relevant: 'Was it with someone you're close to, or more of an acquaintance situation?' shows genuine interest and helps narrow down advice",
      "Pure prose format with zero bullet points - reads as natural conversation throughout"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing an emoji that would enhance the warm, casual tone - Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis, often early in the response (like 😅 or 😊)",
      "Could potentially offer one tiny concrete suggestion alongside the validation, though the approach of gathering more info first is also valid"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate emotional validation ('Oh no, that feeling is the worst!') followed by reframing their worry as a positive trait ('shows you care') is quintessentially Claude's supportive character",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any emoji is the only notable divergence - Claude would likely include a sympathetic emoji like 😅 in the opening to set a warm, casual tone",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting - entirely conversational paragraphs with natural flow. No lists, no headers, no over-structuring. Reads exactly like a supportive text message."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical, so there are no differences in content, tone, structure, or approach",
      "The only potential enhancement would be adding an emoji (😅 or similar) in the opening line to fully match Claude's typical emoji usage pattern"
