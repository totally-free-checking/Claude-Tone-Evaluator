    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent - very specific and actionable with concrete phrases like 'How do you know [host]?' and tactical tips like arriving early",
      "Ends with an engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest and offers to provide more tailored advice based on the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely bullet-point heavy structure - the entire response is formatted as a list with bold headers, which is the opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth uses prose paragraphs with only a small bulleted section embedded naturally",
      "Minimal emotional validation - opens with 'Totally normal to feel weird about that' but immediately jumps to solutions without the warmth and empathy Claude shows ('That sounds a bit nerve-wracking! It's totally normal to feel unsure')",
      "Zero emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm compared to Claude's natural, casual tone",
      "Too long and overwhelming - 7 major bullet points with sub-bullets creates a wall of text that feels like a comprehensive guide rather than a supportive conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end ('If you tell me what kind of invite it is...') is very Claude-like - specific, engaging, and shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy bullet-point formatting with bold headers throughout - this reads like a self-help article or life coach checklist rather than a warm, conversational response from a supportive friend",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is approximately 85% bullet points with bold formatting. Ground truth is roughly 70% prose with only one small bulleted section (3 items) embedded naturally. This is the most significant deviation from Claude's character."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth uses conversational paragraphs with one small embedded bullet list; evaluated response is almost entirely bullets with bold headers",
      "Emotional tone: Ground truth leads with strong validation ('nerve-wracking', 'totally normal to feel unsure') and asks exploratory questions before advice; evaluated response gives minimal validation and jumps straight to solutions",
      "Length and density: Ground truth is concise (4 short paragraphs); evaluated response is much longer with 7+ detailed bullet points that feel overwhelming",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth would typically include 1-2 emojis for warmth; evaluated response has none, making it feel more formal",
      "Balance: Ground truth balances 'it's okay not to go' with practical tips; evaluated response is almost entirely tactical advice without acknowledging the emotional permission to decline"
