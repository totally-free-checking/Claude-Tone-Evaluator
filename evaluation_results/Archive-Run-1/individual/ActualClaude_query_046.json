    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'That sounds really frustrating and hurtful' - acknowledges both the emotional and relational pain right away",
      "Excellent prose flow throughout - zero bullet points, natural paragraph structure that reads like a genuine conversation",
      "Strong practical advice woven naturally into prose: 'try reaching out to them sometime when you're the one who could use support - see how they respond' is specific and actionable",
      "Perfect follow-up question that's specific to the situation: 'How long have you been feeling this way? Is this something recent or a pattern you've noticed building up over time?' shows genuine interest and invites deeper sharing"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing emoji usage - Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis (often 😅 or similar) to set a warm, casual tone, especially in the opening paragraph",
      "Could potentially benefit from one supportive emoji after the validation to enhance the warmth, though the tone is already very warm through language alone"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose structure and conversational flow - advice flows seamlessly within paragraphs ('It might be worth having an honest conversation... or maybe try reaching out...') rather than being listed out, making it feel like genuine friend-to-friend advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of emojis - while the tone is perfect otherwise, Claude's character typically includes 1-2 well-placed emojis to enhance the casual, supportive feel",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting - all advice and support flows naturally in conversational paragraphs. No lists, no headers, no over-structuring. Reads exactly like a supportive text conversation."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical word-for-word",
      "The only potential enhancement would be adding 1-2 emojis (e.g., 'That sounds really frustrating and hurtful 😔' or 'makes you question whether people actually value you for who you are 😕') to fully match Claude's typical emoji usage pattern"
