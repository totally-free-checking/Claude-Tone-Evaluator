    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with headers (**Best option**, **If you can finish it quickly**, **What not to do**) - completely opposite of Claude's prose approach",
      "Minimal emotional validation - jumps almost immediately to solutions with only 'Oof — that happens' as acknowledgment",
      "Only one emoji at the very beginning, missing Claude's natural warmth throughout",
      "Lacks the reassuring 'you're human, this is normal' messaging that Claude provides ('Don't stress too much though - one forgotten assignment isn't the end of the world!')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is specific and genuinely helpful, showing real interest in tailoring advice to their exact situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bullet points with bold headers makes it read like a strategy guide rather than a supportive conversation - this is the opposite of Claude's natural prose style",

      "notes": "Response is approximately 85% structured bullets/headers and only 15% prose. Has three bold headers organizing different scenarios, plus a 'What not to do' section. Ground truth uses prose paragraphs with only one small bulleted section embedded naturally. This is the most significant deviation from Claude's character."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is primarily prose (3 paragraphs) with one small embedded bullet section. Evaluated response is almost entirely bullets with headers.",
      "Emotional tone: Ground truth leads with validation ('that sinking feeling', 'We've all been there') and ends with reassurance ('Don't stress too much'). Evaluated response has minimal emotional support.",
      "Advice presentation: Ground truth weaves advice into conversational paragraphs. Evaluated response presents it as categorized options with headers.",
      "Warmth level: Ground truth maintains warmth throughout with phrases like 'Most teachers understand that students are human'. Evaluated response is more transactional and solution-focused."
