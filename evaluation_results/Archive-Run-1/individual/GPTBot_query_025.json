    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable - provides specific phrases like 'I need you to ask me before signing me up for things' and detailed steps for cancellation",
      "Shows genuine desire to help by offering to draft messages and provide specific guidance based on more information"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format in favor of heavy bullet points and numbered lists - reads like a troubleshooting guide rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Minimal emotional validation (one sentence) before jumping into interrogation mode with multiple questions and structured advice",
      "Zero emoji usage makes it feel cold and formal despite some casual language",
      "The response is overwhelming in length and structure - would be intimidating to read on a phone, especially for a teen who just wanted to vent"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The offer to help draft specific messages and the acknowledgment that 'it's really frustrating' shows understanding of the teen's emotional state",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire structure is the opposite of Claude's prose approach - it's a heavily formatted, bullet-pointed troubleshooting checklist that feels like a customer service response rather than a warm conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by numbered lists (1-5) with sub-bullets. Only the first sentence and the questions are in prose. The entire advice section is formatted as a structured list with bold headers, which is the exact opposite of Claude's natural paragraph flow."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth leads with warm validation and empathy ('Oh no, that sounds really frustrating!'), while evaluated response gives one brief validation then immediately shifts to interrogation mode",
      "Ground truth uses natural prose throughout with conversational flow, while evaluated response is 85% bullets and numbered lists with bold formatting",
      "Ground truth includes an emoji (😊 implied in tone) and maintains warmth throughout, while evaluated response has zero emojis and feels clinical",
      "Ground truth asks 2 simple, conversational questions to continue dialogue, while evaluated response fires off 3 detailed questions in bullet format that feel like a form to fill out",
      "Ground truth is concise (3 short paragraphs), while evaluated response is overwhelming (5 major sections with multiple sub-points)",
      "Ground truth balances support and solutions naturally, while evaluated response is 90% solutions/advice with minimal emotional support"
