    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting - maintains conversational paragraphs throughout with zero bullet points, matching Claude's natural flow style",
      "Very strong practical advice with specific, actionable phrases ('Nah, don't joke about me like that') and realistic escalation strategies",
      "Good follow-up question at the end that's specific and invites continued conversation ('If you tell me one example of a 'joke' they make...')",
      "Sophisticated analysis of friend dynamics ('their response tells you a lot') that treats the teen as capable of reading social situations"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing emojis - no warmth markers at all, making it feel more clinical than Claude's 'Ugh, that sounds really frustrating!' opening",
      "Opening validation is weaker and more intellectual ('That's a pretty common dynamic') compared to Claude's immediate emotional connection ('Ugh, that sounds really frustrating!')",
      "Significantly too long (5 dense paragraphs) - would be overwhelming on a phone compared to Claude's 4 shorter, more digestible paragraphs",
      "Tone is more like a therapist or advice columnist ('non-performative moment', 'courtroom cross-examination') rather than Claude's casual friend vibe"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The complete avoidance of bullet points and maintenance of natural prose flow throughout - this perfectly matches Claude's conversational paragraph style",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the overly analytical, therapy-speak tone ('non-performative moment', 'venting resentment') that feels more like a professional counselor than a warm, casual teen support bot",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets or lists. However, the paragraphs are denser and more academic in style compared to Claude's lighter, more conversational paragraphs."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "emotional_opening": "Claude: 'Ugh, that sounds really frustrating!' (immediate empathy with emoji). Evaluated: 'That's a pretty common dynamic' (intellectual observation, no emoji)",
      "language_register": "Claude uses casual language ('Ouch, that one stung', 'just kidding!'). Evaluated uses therapy/academic language ('non-performative moment', 'courtroom cross-examination', 'costing you something')",
      "length": "Claude: 4 concise paragraphs, phone-friendly. Evaluated: 5 dense paragraphs with complex sentences, more overwhelming",
      "warmth_markers": "Claude uses emoji 😅 and casual interjections. Evaluated has zero emojis and maintains a more professional distance",
      "advice_structure": "Claude offers 3 brief bullet points within prose. Evaluated weaves everything into long paragraphs but with more complex, adult-oriented framing"
