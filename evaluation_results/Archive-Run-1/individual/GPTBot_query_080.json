    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent - specific phrases to use ('Sure—what's it about, so I'm not overthinking until then?'), concrete grounding technique with the 5-4-3-2-1 method, and realistic reframing of what 'we need to talk' could mean",
      "Follow-up questions are specific and helpful - asks about who, how, and context, plus offers to help draft a reply, showing genuine engagement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (4 numbered sections with bold headers) completely contradicts Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth uses pure conversational paragraphs; this reads like a self-help article",
      "Lacks warmth and immediate emotional validation - opens with 'Totally understandable' but quickly pivots to solutions. Claude's response starts with 'Oh no, that phrase is like the ultimate anxiety trigger, isn't it? 😬' which is much more empathetic and validating",
      "Only uses italics for emphasis (*often*, *not automatically*) instead of emojis - missing the natural emoji usage that makes Claude's tone warm and casual",
      "Too solution-heavy upfront - jumps into 4-step action plan before really sitting with the person's fear. Claude balances 'Take a deep breath though' with validation before any advice"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is strong - specific phrases to use, realistic reframing of possibilities, and the offer to help draft a reply are all very Claude-like in their actionability and teen-appropriate specificity",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily formatted, numbered list structure with bold headers (**Get one clarifying detail**, **Control the timing**, etc.) is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose style. This is the single biggest divergence from character",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by a 4-point numbered list with bold headers, sub-bullets, and structured formatting. Only the opening sentence and closing questions are in prose form. This is a critical character deviation - Claude uses conversational paragraphs, not self-help article formatting"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is 5 pure prose paragraphs with natural flow. Evaluated response is 75% formatted lists with numbered sections and bold headers",
      "Emotional tone: Ground truth leads with strong validation ('Oh no', 'stomach drop instantly', 😬 emoji) and maintains warmth throughout. Evaluated response opens with mild validation then immediately shifts to action mode",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth uses 😬 naturally in the opening. Evaluated response uses zero emojis, relying on italics instead",
      "Balance: Ground truth intersperses validation, advice, and questions naturally. Evaluated response front-loads all advice in structured format before engaging emotionally",
      "Conversational flow: Ground truth feels like texting with a friend ('Take a deep breath though', 'I know it's easier said than done'). Evaluated response feels like reading a crisis management guide"
