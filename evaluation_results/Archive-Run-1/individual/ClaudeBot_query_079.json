    },
    "strengths": [
      "Strong prose formatting - maintains paragraph structure throughout with only one small bullet section, much better than typical responses",
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable suggestions like 'sitting against a wall' and 'take one sip of water, put both feet on the floor'",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific and relevant: 'Do you know what part feels scariest—being watched, making a mess, chewing/swallowing, or something else?'",
      "Validates the feeling as 'really common' early on, acknowledging the experience is real"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing emojis - makes it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's natural style (Claude used 😊 in ground truth)",
      "More clinical/therapeutic language ('your brain can still treat it like a high-stakes moment', 'for your body to learn it's not dangerous') vs Claude's casual 'literally everyone eats, so it's the most normal thing ever'",
      "Longer and more complex than needed - the breathing/grounding technique paragraph feels like a therapy worksheet rather than friend advice",
      "Opening validation is weaker than Claude's 'I totally get that - eating in front of others can feel really awkward sometimes!' - less immediate warmth"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is excellent - specific, shows genuine interest, and naturally continues the conversation just like Claude's approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the clinical/therapeutic language ('your body to learn it's not dangerous') makes it feel more like a counselor than a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "85%",
      "notes": "Good prose-heavy approach with only one small bullet section. However, Claude's ground truth also used bullets (4 items), so this is actually well-matched. The bullets are integrated naturally into the flow rather than dominating the response."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth has no emoji either (I was wrong in my initial assessment - checking again, Claude's response doesn't show an emoji). Both responses lack emojis.",
      "tone": "Ground truth is warmer and more casual ('literally everyone eats', 'way too focused on their own stuff') vs evaluated response's more therapeutic tone ('your brain can still treat it like a high-stakes moment')",
      "length": "Evaluated response is significantly longer (4 substantial paragraphs) vs ground truth (2 shorter paragraphs + bullets + question). Ground truth is more concise.",
      "validation_style": "Ground truth leads with strong immediate validation ('I totally get that') while evaluated response is more explanatory ('really common, especially if you're worried about...')",
      "advice_complexity": "Evaluated response includes detailed grounding techniques and counselor referral, while ground truth keeps advice simpler and more peer-to-peer"
