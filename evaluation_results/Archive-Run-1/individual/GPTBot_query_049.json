    "strengths": [
      "Opens with validation ('Totally relatable') which acknowledges the feeling",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable - the 'zoom out' framework and 'low-stakes next step' are genuinely helpful",
      "Ends with an invitation to share more context, showing interest in continuing the conversation",
      "The 'Don't mind-read' point is wise and realistic for teens"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (4 major bullet points with bold headers) - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth uses flowing paragraphs; this reads like a checklist",
      "Missing emojis entirely - Claude uses 😅 to set a warm, casual tone early. This response feels more formal/instructional without them",
      "Jumps too quickly to problem-solving mode. Ground truth spends more time in the emotional validation space ('Oh no, you've entered the classic overthinking spiral!') before offering solutions",
      "The opening validation is brief and perfunctory compared to Claude's more expansive, playful acknowledgment of the overthinking experience"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is strong - specific, realistic, and actionable for a teen (especially the 'low-stakes next step' suggestion)",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-point heavy formatting with bold headers (**Zoom out:**, **Look for patterns:**) - this is the exact opposite of Claude's natural prose style and is the biggest character divergence",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response is approximately 70% bullet-pointed advice with bold headers, 30% prose. Ground truth is 100% prose with natural paragraph flow. This is a fundamental structural mismatch with Claude's character."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth uses 4 flowing paragraphs; evaluated response uses intro + 4 bullet points with bold headers",
      "Emotional engagement: Ground truth spends more time playfully validating the overthinking ('detective trying to analyze every tiny detail', 'brain trying to turn it into a complex puzzle'). Evaluated response moves quickly to solutions",
      "Tone warmth: Ground truth has more personality and warmth ('Oh no', 'I totally get it though', 'hey, try to enjoy the moment'). Evaluated response is more instructional/coaching",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth uses 😅 naturally; evaluated response has none, making it feel more formal",
      "Advice delivery: Ground truth weaves advice into conversational prose; evaluated response presents it as a structured framework"
