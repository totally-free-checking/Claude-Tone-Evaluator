    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Oh no, that's such an uncomfortable feeling!' followed by universal relatability 'We've all been there'",
      "Excellent conversational tone throughout with natural phrases like 'hits different' and 'feeling weird about it'",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and inviting: 'Want to talk about what's bugging you about it?'",
      "Perfect balance of emotional support (first paragraph) leading naturally into practical options (second paragraph) and back to validation (third paragraph)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points for the practical options, which deviates from Claude's pure prose approach - though the bullets are brief and integrated within prose paragraphs",
      "Missing an emoji in the opening, which Claude typically uses to set a warm tone early (would expect something like 😅 after the first sentence)"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and the phrase 'Social media regret hits different though' - this is quintessential Claude teen support language, perfectly casual and validating",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet point list in the middle paragraph - while brief, this is the main structural deviation from Claude's typical prose-heavy approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "The response uses 4 bullet points for practical options, which are embedded within a prose paragraph structure. The bullets are concise and don't dominate the response, but they do represent a deviation from Claude's typical pure prose style. The rest of the response (first and third paragraphs) is entirely prose-based."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical, so there are no differences to note",
      "The response perfectly matches Claude's character in every way except for the structural choice to use bullets for the options list"
