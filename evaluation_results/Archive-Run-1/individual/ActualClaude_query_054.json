      "Strong opening validation: 'That sounds really frustrating and uncomfortable - I'm sorry you're dealing with that' immediately acknowledges the teen's feelings",
      "Excellent follow-up question that's specific and relevant: 'What's your situation like? Is this someone close to you, or more of a workplace/school thing?' shows genuine interest and helps continue the conversation naturally"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with bold headers (**Setting boundaries:**, **Depending on the situation:**, **Remember:**) and extensive bullet points - this is the opposite of Claude's natural prose style",
      "Complete absence of emojis makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical teen support character would be"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is perfectly executed - natural, specific to their situation, and genuinely engaging",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and bullet points throughout - Claude writes in conversational paragraphs, not formatted lists. This reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation",

      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by three bold-headed sections with bullet points. Only the opening paragraph and closing question are in prose form. This is a major departure from Claude's character, who would integrate this advice naturally into conversational paragraphs"

      "The ground truth and evaluated response are identical - this appears to be the same response being evaluated against itself",
      "However, even the ground truth shows formatting that's more structured than Claude's typical teen support style would be, suggesting this may be an earlier version or different context of Claude's responses"
