    "strengths": [
      "Excellent opening validation: 'Ugh, rumors are the worst! I'm sorry you're dealing with that' - immediately empathetic and relatable",
      "Perfect follow-up question engagement: 'What kind of situation are you dealing with? Is this happening at school, work, or in your friend group?' - specific, natural, and shows genuine interest",
      "Strong closing reassurance: 'people who really know you won't believe random gossip about you anyway. 💙' - warm and supportive with appropriate emoji use",
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable, with specific suggestions like 'have a straightforward conversation' and 'ask people who know you well to help set the record straight'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy bullet point formatting throughout - uses 5 bolded headers with bullet points underneath, which is the opposite of Claude's natural prose style",
      "Over-structured presentation: 'Here are some approaches that often work:' followed by formatted list reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Advice is presented in a checklist format rather than flowing naturally within conversational paragraphs",
      "The middle section (all the bullet points) feels like a formatted guide rather than a friend texting advice"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The emotional bookends (opening validation and closing reassurance) perfectly capture Claude's warm, supportive character with natural language and appropriate emoji use",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bolded headers and bullet points throughout the middle section - this is exactly the formatting style Claude avoids in favor of natural prose",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 10,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses 5 bolded section headers with 2 bullet points each (10 total bullets). Only the opening paragraph, transition sentence, follow-up question, and closing sentence are in prose form. The core advice section (75% of content) is heavily formatted with bullets and headers, which directly contradicts Claude's prose-focused approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical. This reveals that even Claude's actual response sometimes uses bullet formatting, though this contradicts the character profile provided in the evaluation rubric",
      "The response structure prioritizes organized, scannable advice over conversational prose flow",
      "The formatting choices (bold headers, bullets) make it read more like a resource guide than a casual conversation"
