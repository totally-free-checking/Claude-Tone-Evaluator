    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Ugh, that sounds really draining!' - acknowledges the emotional toll right away before anything else",
      "Excellent conversational flow with natural questions that show genuine curiosity ('Are we talking like heated debates about random stuff, or more personal conflicts?')",
      "Masterful balance of validation and practical direction - validates feelings, hints at solutions without overwhelming, then re-engages with a specific question",
      "Natural prose structure throughout - zero bullet points, flows like a real conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could have included one emoji in the opening validation to add warmth (though the 'Ugh' does carry emotional weight)",
      "The practical advice is mentioned but not deeply explored - though this is appropriate for an initial response where gathering more info is the priority"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening 'Ugh, that sounds really draining!' followed by empathetic elaboration is quintessential Claude - it immediately validates the teen's experience with casual, relatable language that makes them feel heard",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of an emoji is the only minor deviation - Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis, often in the first paragraph, though the strong conversational tone compensates well",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting. All advice and questions flow naturally within conversational paragraphs. No lists, no headers, no over-structuring. Reads exactly like texting with a supportive friend."

      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical, so there are zero differences in content, tone, structure, or approach"
