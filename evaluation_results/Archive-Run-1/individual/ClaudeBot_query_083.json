    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable examples like 'offer a small opening' and the concrete coffee invitation test",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and inviting: 'If you tell me what they're doing—one or two specific examples, and the context (coworker? friend? stranger?)—I can help you read it more accurately'",
      "Good conversational moments like 'That's genuinely hard, because good flirting often looks like good social skills' and 'are we in our own bubble right now?'",
      "Thoughtful nuance in distinguishing flirting from friendliness with the 'Things that lean' framework"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Zero emojis - completely missing Claude's warm, casual emoji usage (Claude used 😅 right away)",
      "Heavy bullet/list structure throughout - uses italicized headers ('They consistently seek you out', 'The attention is a bit more personal') which reads like a formatted article rather than natural conversation",
      "Lacks immediate emotional validation - jumps straight into analysis without acknowledging 'Oh, the eternal mystery!' or 'That's honestly one of the most relatable dilemmas'",
      "Too long and dense (much longer than Claude's response) - feels more like a comprehensive guide than a supportive text conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is excellent - specific, contextual, and genuinely interested in helping with their particular situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and heavy use of italicized headers/structured formatting makes it read like a dating advice article rather than a warm, casual conversation with a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points, uses extensive italicized headers as section breaks ('They consistently seek you out', 'The attention is a bit more personal', 'There's some tension/playfulness', 'They try to extend time', 'Body language matches', 'Things that lean just being nice') which creates the same over-structured effect. Only about 40% is true conversational prose - the rest is formatted like a structured guide."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude starts with immediate validation and relatability ('Oh, the eternal mystery! 😅 That's honestly one of the most relatable dilemmas'), while the evaluated response jumps straight into analysis",
      "Claude uses clear bullet points openly but keeps them concise; evaluated response uses italicized headers that create similar structure but pretends to be prose",
      "Claude includes an emoji and maintains warmth throughout; evaluated response is completely emoji-free and more analytical",
      "Claude's response is more concise and phone-readable; evaluated response is significantly longer and denser",
      "Claude has a more conversational 'But honestly?' transition; evaluated response maintains a more consistent analytical tone throughout"
