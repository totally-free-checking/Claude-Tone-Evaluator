      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use ('Hey, I realized what I said might've come off rude...')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - feels too formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 'Oh no, that feeling is the worst!' opening",
      "Heavy use of quotation marks and structured advice delivery makes it feel like a communication guide rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Jumps too quickly into solutions without enough emotional validation - Claude spends more time acknowledging the feeling first",
      "The phrase 'That's a really human situation' feels clinical compared to Claude's more natural 'Oh no, that feeling is the worst!'"

      "notes": "While technically in prose format, the heavy use of quotation marks and structured 'if-then' advice delivery creates a similar effect to bullet points - it reads more like a formatted guide than natural conversation"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude opens with 'Oh no, that feeling is the worst!' (immediate emotional validation) vs. 'That's a really human situation' (more detached observation)",
      "Claude uses an emoji and exclamation points to convey warmth; evaluated response has no emojis and feels more formal",
      "Claude asks exploratory questions first ('What happened?') before offering solutions; evaluated response jumps straight into repair strategies",
      "Claude's tone is more conversational and friend-like ('which is really sweet'); evaluated response is more instructional ('the cleanest repair is...')",
      "Claude focuses on understanding the situation first; evaluated response provides multiple solution templates upfront"
