    "strengths": [
      "Excellent warmth and validation - 'don't be so hard on yourself' and 'It doesn't make you a bad person at all' immediately validates feelings",
      "Strong conversational tone with natural phrases like 'Hearts can be pretty messy sometimes' and 'Totally normal, and nothing to beat yourself up over'",
      "Perfect follow-up question that's engaging and specific: 'Want to talk through what's going on a bit more? Sometimes it helps just to get it all out'",
      "Good balance of emotional support (first two paragraphs) before moving to practical considerations"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "CRITICAL: Uses bullet points for the advice section ('A few things that might help:' followed by three bullets) - this is the biggest deviation from Claude's prose-focused character",
      "Complete absence of emojis - Claude typically uses 1-2 emojis to set a warm, casual tone, especially early in the response",
      "The bullet point section breaks the conversational flow and makes it feel more structured/formatted than Claude's natural prose style"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and conversational tone - 'Hey, that sounds really tough! First off, don't be so hard on yourself' perfectly captures Claude's immediate empathetic response",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed 'A few things that might help:' section - Claude would weave these questions naturally into prose paragraphs rather than listing them out",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "The response has 5 paragraphs total, but one entire paragraph is a bullet-pointed list. This significantly disrupts the conversational flow. Claude would integrate these questions naturally: 'I'm curious - are you actually dating either of these people, or are these more like crushes? And what specifically is making you feel most guilty about it?'"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth is identical in content BUT this appears to BE the ground truth - they are word-for-word the same, including the bullet points",
      "The evaluation reveals that even Claude's own response has bullet points, which contradicts the character profile's emphasis on prose-only formatting",
      "Missing emojis that would typically appear in Claude's teen support responses (the character profile indicates 1-2 emojis are standard, usually early in the response)"
