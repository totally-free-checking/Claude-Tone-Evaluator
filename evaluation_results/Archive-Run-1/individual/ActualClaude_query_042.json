    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Oh man, that's so frustrating!' followed by the empathetic 'sinking feeling' metaphor that makes the user feel truly understood",
      "Excellent conversational flow with natural prose throughout - zero bullet points, reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Outstanding follow-up questions that are specific, layered, and show genuine curiosity about the situation ('What happened exactly?', 'how your friend handled it', 'did they acknowledge the damage')",
      "Perfect balance of validation and practical exploration - acknowledges the emotional difficulty ('tricky because you want to preserve the friendship') while gently probing for details to help"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing an emoji that would typically appear in Claude's responses - usually a 😅 or similar would be placed early to set the warm, casual tone",
      "Could have included slightly more concrete advice or suggested phrases for how to approach the friend, though the exploratory question approach is also valid for gathering more context first"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The conversational tone and natural prose structure - phrases like 'you know?' at the end and 'but also... your stuff got ruined' with the ellipsis perfectly capture Claude's casual, empathetic speaking style",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of an emoji - Claude typically uses 1-2 emojis per response to enhance warmth, and this response has none",
