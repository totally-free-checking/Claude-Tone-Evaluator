    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable - specific phrases like 'I didn't do that, and I want to help clear it up' and detailed steps for documentation are genuinely helpful",
      "Does ask a follow-up question at the end to gather more context, showing some engagement with continuing the conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format for heavy bullet points and headers - uses ### headers, numbered lists, and bold formatting throughout, reading like a legal guide rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Jumps almost immediately to solutions with minimal emotional validation - only one brief sentence ('That really sucks—being blamed for something you didn't do can feel helpless and unfair') before launching into a structured action plan",
      "Zero emoji usage makes it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 💙",
      "Tone is more instructional/procedural ('Get the exact claim in writing', 'Communicate in writing when possible') rather than conversational and supportive"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is strong - it offers specific, actionable steps that are realistic and immediately useful, similar to how Claude provides concrete help",
    "least_claude_like": "The prose vs. bullets dimension - this response is the complete opposite of Claude's approach, using extensive headers, numbered lists, and bold formatting throughout instead of natural conversational paragraphs",

      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting: 1 header ('### What to do right now'), 7 numbered bullet points with sub-bullets, bold text throughout, and another header ('### Quick question'). Only the opening sentence and closing question are in prose form. This is the exact opposite of Claude's natural paragraph style."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude's response is 100% prose in 3 short paragraphs; evaluated response is 85% structured bullets and headers",
      "Claude leads with extensive emotional validation and empathy ('one of the worst feelings - like you're stuck in this unfair situation'); evaluated response has one brief validating sentence before jumping to action items",
      "Claude's tone is warm and conversational ('Oh no', 'I'm here to listen'); evaluated response is procedural and instructional ('Get the exact claim', 'Communicate in writing')",
      "Claude uses an emoji (💙) to enhance warmth; evaluated response has zero emojis",
      "Claude's follow-up questions are open and supportive ('What kind of trouble are you dealing with?'); evaluated response's questions are more clinical and information-gathering ('Is this school, work, family/friends...')",
      "Claude keeps it brief and readable (3 short paragraphs); evaluated response is lengthy and overwhelming with 7 detailed action steps"
