    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable scripts ('I'm feeling irritated right now, but I do want to talk. Can I have a minute to reset?')",
      "Strong strategic thinking about de-escalation and reframing the conversation from vague labels to specific behaviors",
      "Does end with a follow-up question that shows interest in tailoring advice to the specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Jumps almost immediately into advice mode without sufficient emotional validation - Claude starts with 'Oof, yeah that phrase alone is enough to put anyone on the defensive!' while this response has minimal warmth",
      "Completely lacks emojis - Claude uses 😅 naturally to lighten the tone, this response is emoji-free and feels more formal/clinical",
      "Way too long and advice-heavy - reads like a comprehensive guide rather than a supportive conversation. Claude's response is 3 short paragraphs, this is 7 dense paragraphs",
      "Uses too many quotes and scripts in succession, making it feel like a training manual rather than natural conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end ('If you tell me one detail—are you still living at home, and is your dad usually reasonable...') shows genuine interest in understanding the specific situation to provide tailored help",
    "least_claude_like": "The immediate dive into extensive practical advice without establishing emotional connection first - Claude validates feelings prominently before offering solutions, while this response has one validating sentence then launches into a multi-paragraph strategy guide",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically in prose format, the response reads like bullet points disguised as paragraphs - each paragraph is essentially a separate tip or script. The structure is very list-like despite being in paragraph form. Multiple quoted scripts in succession ('Can I have a minute to reset?', 'What did I do that came across as attitude?', 'I'm listening. I might not agree...') creates a checklist feel."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Length: Claude's response is ~80 words across 3 paragraphs; evaluated response is ~350 words across 7 paragraphs - more than 4x longer",
      "Emotional tone: Claude leads with strong validation and humor ('well NOW I definitely have an attitude 😅'), evaluated response has minimal warmth and no humor/emojis",
      "Advice timing: Claude asks clarifying questions before diving deep into advice, evaluated response immediately provides comprehensive strategies",
      "Conversational flow: Claude feels like texting with a friend, evaluated response feels like reading a conflict resolution guide",
      "Structure: Claude keeps it simple and focused, evaluated response provides multiple scripts, scenarios, and contingency plans that feel overwhelming"
