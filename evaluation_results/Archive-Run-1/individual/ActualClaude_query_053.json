    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' - captures the emotional weight right away and uses natural, relatable language",
      "Excellent conversational tone throughout with phrases like 'There's nothing quite like' and 'But also... your time matters too!' that feel authentic and supportive",
      "Strong balance of validation and practical guidance - validates feelings first, then offers questions to help them think through it, then reinforces their worth",
      "Perfect follow-up question that's specific and natural: 'Have you thought about talking to them about it directly, or are you more in the \"figuring out how to deal with it\" stage?' - shows genuine interest and invites continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Contains a bullet point list with three questions, which slightly deviates from Claude's pure prose preference - though the bullets are minimal and serve a clear purpose",
      "Could have included one more emoji (perhaps a 😅 after 'flakey' or similar) to fully match Claude's typical 1-2 emoji usage pattern"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The emotional validation and conversational flow - 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' followed by the empathetic acknowledgment 'There's nothing quite like getting mentally prepared for plans only to have them fall through' perfectly captures Claude's warm, relatable tone",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of bullet points for the three questions - while minimal and purposeful, Claude typically embeds questions within prose rather than listing them out",

      "notes": "The response is primarily prose (4 paragraphs) with one small bullet section containing 3 questions. The bullets serve a clear organizational purpose for the diagnostic questions, but Claude would typically weave these into conversational prose like 'I'm curious - do they usually give a reason? And is this recent or have they always been this way?'"
