    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Aw man, that really sucks' - acknowledges the pain right away without minimizing",
      "Exceptional emotional intelligence in recognizing the 'trying to act fine' aspect and explicitly giving permission to feel bad ('You don't have to pretend it doesn't sting')",
      "Natural, conversational prose throughout with zero bullet points or formatting - reads exactly like a supportive text message",
      "Ends with a caring follow-up question ('Are you doing okay?') that feels genuine and invites continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could have included one emoji (likely 😔 or similar) in the opening to add warmth, though the absence doesn't significantly detract from the overall tone",
      "Leans slightly more toward emotional support than practical advice - while appropriate for this query, a tiny suggestion about what to do with these feelings could enhance it"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The recognition and validation of the 'trying to act fine' dynamic - this shows deep emotional attunement and gives explicit permission to feel disappointed, which is quintessentially Claude's supportive approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of an emoji in the opening paragraph, though this is a very minor deviation",
