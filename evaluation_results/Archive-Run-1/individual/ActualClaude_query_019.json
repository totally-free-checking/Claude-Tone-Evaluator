    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That's such a frustrating situation! It totally makes sense that you'd be stressed about this.' - immediately acknowledges the teen's feelings",
      "Excellent follow-up questions that are specific and engaging: 'What kind of assignment was it? And do you have any idea why your answers were so similar to the other student's?' - shows genuine interest and invites continued conversation",
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable, with specific suggestions like 'Walk them through your thought process' and 'Show any notes, rough work, or sources you used'",
      "Good closing statement that balances realism with encouragement: 'Even if the situation feels unfair, approaching it maturely will probably work in your favor'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "HEAVILY bullet-pointed structure with three major sections ('Talk to your teacher directly:', 'Gather evidence:', 'Know your options:') each containing multiple sub-bullets - this is the complete opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "Complete absence of emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical style, missing the casual, supportive tone that emojis help establish",
      "Bold headers (**Talk to your teacher directly:**) create an over-structured, article-like format rather than a conversational flow",
      "The advice section dominates the response (about 70% of content) with minimal emotional support woven throughout - should have more validation integrated with the practical suggestions"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and closing follow-up questions perfectly capture Claude's warm, engaging character - immediately making the teen feel heard and then inviting them to share more",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bullet points with bold headers creates a structured, list-heavy format that reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation - this is the single biggest deviation from Claude's natural prose style",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 10,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response contains 3 major bolded sections with 10 total bullet points. Only the opening paragraph, transitional sentence ('Here are some ways...'), middle transition ('The key is...'), and closing questions are in prose form. This is approximately 70% bullets/30% prose, which is the inverse of Claude's typical approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Ground truth is IDENTICAL to the response being evaluated - they are the exact same text. This means the ground truth itself contains heavy bullet formatting, which contradicts the character profile description of Claude avoiding bullets and using natural prose",
      "structural_issue": "This evaluation reveals an inconsistency: the ground truth provided does not match the described character profile of avoiding bullet points and using conversational paragraphs",
      "emoji_absence": "No emojis in either response, though character profile indicates Claude typically uses 1-2 emojis per response"
