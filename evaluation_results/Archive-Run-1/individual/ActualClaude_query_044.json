      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' - instantly acknowledges the emotional experience before anything else",
      "Exceptional conversational tone with natural language like '*poof*', 'deer in headlights', and 'Happens to literally everyone' that feels authentic and relatable",
      "Pure prose format with zero bullet points - flows naturally as three connected paragraphs that read like a supportive text message",
      "Excellent follow-up question that's specific and engaging: 'Did you manage to say anything, or were you just sitting there like a deer in headlights?' - shows genuine interest and invites continued conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could have included 1-2 emojis to enhance the warm, casual tone (typically Claude uses 😅 or similar in the opening paragraph)",
