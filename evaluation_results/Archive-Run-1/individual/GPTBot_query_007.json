      "Practical advice is excellent - very specific and actionable with concrete examples like the message templates ('Hey — the project is due tomorrow...')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format for heavy bullet points and numbered sections with headers (## 1), ## 2), etc.) - the exact opposite of Claude's natural paragraph style",
      "Opens with minimal emotional validation ('That's super stressful') then immediately jumps into structured advice without the warm, empathetic tone Claude establishes ('Oof, that's super stressful! 😬 I feel for you - we've all been there')",
      "Only uses em-dash punctuation, no emojis at all - feels formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm 😬 emoji that sets the supportive tone",
      "Reads like a comprehensive guide or article with sections and subsections rather than a conversational response from a supportive friend"

    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality and specificity - the message templates and concrete action steps are exactly the kind of immediately actionable guidance Claude provides",
    "least_claude_like": "The formatting structure - this is formatted like a self-help article with numbered sections, headers, and extensive bullet points, which is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose paragraph style",

      "formatting": "Ground truth uses minimal bullets (3 main points with sub-bullets) within conversational paragraphs. Evaluated response is 85% structured lists with headers.",
      "emotional_opening": "Ground truth: 'Oof, that's super stressful! 😬 I feel for you - we've all been there' (warm, validating, relatable). Evaluated: 'That's super stressful—especially with a deadline tomorrow' (acknowledges stress but immediately pivots to solutions).",
      "tone_throughout": "Ground truth maintains conversational warmth throughout ('This situation sucks', 'don't kill yourself trying'). Evaluated response is professional/instructional ('Triage tonight', 'Document everything (quietly)').",
