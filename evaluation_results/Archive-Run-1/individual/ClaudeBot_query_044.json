    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific phrases to use ('Can you repeat the question?', 'Let me think for a second') and concrete strategies that are immediately actionable",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and relevant ('Does this happen to you a lot when you're put on the spot, or was this a one-off in a stressful moment?')",
      "Good use of prose format throughout - avoids bullet points and maintains paragraph structure",
      "Helpful long-term strategies (practice recall, cue cards, sleep/food/hydration) that are realistic for teens"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with clinical explanation ('threat response', 'adrenaline', 'search function got interrupted') instead of immediate emotional validation - sounds like a textbook rather than a friend",
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes the response feel formal and distant compared to Claude's warm, casual tone",
      "Too long and dense (5 substantial paragraphs) - feels overwhelming and lecture-like rather than conversational",
      "Language is overly formal and academic ('stock moves', 'temporarily go offline', 'more accurate story is') - doesn't match Claude's natural, casual voice ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling!', '*poof*')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is natural, specific, and shows genuine interest in understanding whether this is a pattern or isolated incident",
    "least_claude_like": "The opening completely skips emotional validation and jumps straight into explaining the neuroscience of stress responses - the opposite of Claude's 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Good adherence to prose format with no bullet points. However, the prose itself is dense and academic rather than conversational. The paragraphs read more like an educational article than a supportive text conversation."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling!') while the evaluated response opens with clinical explanation ('threat response', brain science)",
      "Claude uses emojis and expressive formatting (*poof*) to create warmth; evaluated response has zero emojis and no playful language",
      "Claude's tone is casual and conversational ('literally everyone', 'deer in headlights'); evaluated response is formal and instructional ('stock moves', 'accommodation')",
      "Claude keeps it brief (3 short paragraphs) and reassuring; evaluated response is much longer (5 dense paragraphs) and feels like a comprehensive guide",
      "Claude normalizes the experience quickly ('Happens to literally everyone'); evaluated response intellectualizes it first before normalizing",
      "Claude asks a simple, empathetic follow-up ('Did you manage to say anything?'); evaluated response's question is good but comes after a wall of advice"
