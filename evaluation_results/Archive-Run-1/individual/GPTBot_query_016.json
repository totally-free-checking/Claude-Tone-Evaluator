    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable - provides specific message templates like 'Hi Coach, I just realized I accidentally double-booked...' which teens can actually use",
      "Does end with a follow-up question asking for more context about the other plan and whether practice is required, showing engagement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (numbered list with sub-bullets) reads like a troubleshooting guide rather than a supportive conversation - completely opposite of Claude's prose approach",
      "Minimal emotional validation - opens with just 'Ah, that's annoying' then immediately jumps to solutions without acknowledging the stress or relating to the feeling",
      "No emoji usage at all, making it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 😅",
      "The bold headers (**Check how flexible practice is**, **Message the other plan right now**) create an instructional manual feel rather than conversational support"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The specific message templates provided ('I totally forgot I have practice after school today...') are practical and realistic for teens to actually use",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily structured bullet-point format with numbered sections and bold headers - this is the exact opposite of Claude's natural prose style and is the most glaring difference",

      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is approximately 85% structured lists (3 numbered main points with multiple sub-bullets each) and only 15% prose (opening line and closing question). Uses bold headers for each section. This is the complete inverse of Claude's approach which uses pure prose with minimal to no bullets."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses conversational prose with only one small bulleted section embedded naturally; evaluated response is almost entirely structured lists",
      "Ground truth leads with strong emotional validation ('Oh no, that's such a frustrating feeling') and emoji; evaluated response has minimal validation ('Ah, that's annoying') and no emoji",
      "Ground truth maintains warm, casual tone throughout ('Maybe we can figure out the best option!'); evaluated response feels more like a step-by-step guide",
      "Ground truth asks engaging questions first to understand the situation; evaluated response provides all solutions upfront then asks for context at the end"
