    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable phrases like 'I got invited to a party on Saturday. I'd like to go...' - this is exactly the kind of concrete help teens need",
      "Strong prose formatting throughout - avoids bullet points and maintains conversational paragraph structure, which matches Claude's style well",
      "Good follow-up question at the end that's specific and invites more detail ('If you tell me your age and what kind of party it is...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing warmth and emotional validation - jumps straight into advice without acknowledging the nervousness mentioned in the query ('Asking parents can feel nerve-wracking' in ground truth vs. immediate advice in evaluated response)",
      "Zero emojis - makes the response feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm, casual tone",
      "Too formal and instructional in tone - phrases like 'A good way to make this easier is' and 'That signals responsibility' sound like a guidebook rather than a supportive friend",
      "Missing the excitement acknowledgment - ground truth starts with 'That's exciting about the party invite!' while evaluated response ignores this emotional element entirely"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The specific dialogue example ('I got invited to a party on Saturday...') is perfectly Claude-like - concrete, realistic, and immediately usable by a teen",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emotional validation and warmth at the beginning - Claude always validates feelings first ('That's exciting!', 'can feel nerve-wracking') before diving into solutions",

      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting throughout. No bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. This is a major strength and matches Claude's style perfectly."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth starts with emotional validation ('That's exciting!', 'can feel nerve-wracking') while evaluated response jumps straight to practical advice",
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for organizing information, while evaluated response maintains pure prose (ironically, the evaluated response is MORE Claude-like in this dimension)",
      "Ground truth has a warmer, more conversational tone with phrases like 'don't worry' and 'most parents appreciate' vs. the more instructional tone of evaluated response",
      "Ground truth uses emojis naturally, evaluated response has none",
      "Ground truth's follow-up is more casual ('What kind of party is it?') while evaluated response is more formal ('If you tell me your age and what kind of party it is')"
