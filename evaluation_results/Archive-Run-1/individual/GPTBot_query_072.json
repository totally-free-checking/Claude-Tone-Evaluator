    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent and specific - 'Make it task mode, not performance mode' and 'Go for basic + confident, not fancy' are concrete, actionable tips that feel realistic for teens",
      "Shows genuine care with the safety check at the end about whether 'want to die' is literal - this is responsible and thoughtful",
      "Some good conversational touches like 'maximum cringe' and 'my bad—reset' that feel natural"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (6 major bullet points with bold headers) - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth has some bullets but they're nested under prose paragraphs, not the primary structure",
      "Lacks immediate emotional validation - jumps into 'A few things that usually make it way less awful' without first saying 'I totally get why you're feeling mortified' like Claude does",
      "Only one emoji in the entire response (compared to Claude's natural emoji use), and it comes in the first line then disappears",
      "The safety check question at the end, while well-intentioned, feels somewhat clinical and breaks the conversational flow - Claude would likely handle this more naturally within the supportive tone"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is excellent - specific phrases like 'Hey, I'm nervous—can we just keep it simple?' and the 'task mode vs performance mode' framing are exactly the kind of concrete, teen-appropriate guidance Claude would give",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy bullet-point formatting with bold headers (**Remember everyone's focused on themselves**, **Make it 'task mode'**, etc.) - this reads like a self-help article or checklist rather than a warm conversation. Claude's ground truth uses prose paragraphs as the primary structure",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is approximately 85% bullet points with bold headers, 15% prose. Ground truth is roughly 70% prose with bullets nested within sections. This is the most significant structural difference - the evaluated response is bullet-first, while Claude is prose-first."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth leads with warm prose validation ('Oh no, partner dancing in PE class is like the ultimate awkward situation!'), then organizes advice under prose headers with nested bullets. Evaluated response jumps straight to bullet points with minimal prose framing.",
      "Emotional validation timing: Claude validates feelings immediately and extensively in the opening. Evaluated response acknowledges it's 'maximum cringe' but doesn't deeply validate the mortification before offering solutions.",
      "Tone consistency: Ground truth maintains warmth throughout with phrases like 'You've got this!' and 'at least you'll have a funny story.' Evaluated response is more instructional/tactical, especially in the middle sections.",
      "Follow-up question: Claude asks 'What kind of dance is it?' to continue engagement naturally. Evaluated response asks about safety concerns, which while responsible, shifts to a more serious/clinical tone rather than maintaining conversational flow."
