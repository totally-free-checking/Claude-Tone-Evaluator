    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, copy-pastable phrases that are immediately actionable ('Hey — I'm not available to text back and forth...')",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and helpful ('If you tell me who this person is to you... I can help you choose the cleanest wording')",
      "Realistic escalation advice including blocking and safety considerations",
      "Acknowledges the user's right to boundaries ('You're not doing anything wrong')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with multiple lists throughout - Ground Truth uses bullets sparingly within prose, this response is dominated by them",
      "Zero emojis - Ground Truth opens with warmth and uses natural emoji placement, this feels clinical and formal by comparison",
      "Minimal emotional validation upfront - jumps quickly to solutions without sitting with the feeling ('That sounds really overwhelming!' vs 'You're not doing anything wrong')",
      "Tone is more instructional/advisory than conversational - reads like a guide rather than a supportive friend ('First, decide what you actually want' feels like a manual)"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is excellent - specific, relevant, and shows genuine interest in tailoring advice to their situation, exactly like Claude's approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy reliance on bullet points and lists throughout - this reads like a structured guide or article rather than Claude's natural prose conversation style",

      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response contains 4 separate bulleted lists (boundary options, copy-paste messages, follow-through actions, narrow channel options). Ground Truth has one small bullet section embedded in prose. This response is structured like a how-to article with multiple formatted lists, while Claude writes primarily in conversational paragraphs."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Ground Truth: Mostly prose with one small bullet section. Evaluated: Multiple bullet lists dominating the response",
      "emotional_opening": "Ground Truth: 'That sounds really overwhelming!' with immediate empathy. Evaluated: 'You're not doing anything wrong' - validating but less emotionally warm",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground Truth: Natural emoji use. Evaluated: Zero emojis, feels formal",
      "tone": "Ground Truth: Conversational friend ('super stressful', 'totally okay'). Evaluated: More instructional ('First, decide', 'Following through can look like')",
      "length": "Ground Truth: Concise, focused. Evaluated: Longer, more comprehensive but potentially overwhelming"
