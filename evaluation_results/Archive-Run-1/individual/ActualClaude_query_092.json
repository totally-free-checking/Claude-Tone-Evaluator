    "strengths": [
      "Excellent warmth and validation in opening: 'That's such a tough situation to watch. It can be really hard when you see someone you care about changing...' - immediately validates the emotional difficulty",
      "Strong follow-up questions that are specific and engaging: 'How long has this been going on? And are we talking about them being a little different, or more concerning changes...' - shows genuine interest and invites deeper conversation",
      "Practical advice is concrete and realistic: 'Invite them to hang out one-on-one when possible' - gives specific actionable steps appropriate for teens",
      "Natural conversational tone throughout with good use of contractions and casual phrasing: 'might push them away, even if you're right'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bullet points with bold headers - the response has 4 bullet points with bold formatting (**Give it some time first**, **Stay connected without being preachy**, etc.), which is the opposite of Claude's prose-focused approach",
      "Complete absence of emojis - no emojis at all makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical teen support character would be",
      "The phrase 'A few thoughts that might help:' followed by bullets is a classic list-introduction that Claude's character avoids - this signals a structured advice format rather than natural conversation",
      "Over-formatted with bold text throughout - the bold headers make it read like a self-help article rather than a friend texting"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening paragraph and closing questions perfectly capture Claude's warmth and engagement - the validation is immediate and genuine, and the questions are specific and conversational",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy bullet-point formatting with bold headers - this is the single biggest divergence from Claude's character, which strongly prefers natural prose paragraphs over structured lists",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "The response is approximately 80% bullet-pointed advice with bold headers and only 20% prose (opening paragraph and closing questions). This is the inverse of Claude's typical approach, which would be 90%+ prose with advice woven naturally into paragraphs. The 'A few thoughts that might help:' introduction is a clear signal of list-based formatting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical word-for-word, including the bullet point formatting",
      "However, if this represents Claude's actual output, it suggests the ground truth itself may not fully align with the described character profile regarding prose vs. bullets",
      "The ground truth contains significant bullet-point formatting which contradicts the evaluation criteria that emphasizes 'pure prose, conversational flow, zero or minimal bullets'",
      "No emojis present in either response, though the character profile suggests 1-2 emojis are typical"
