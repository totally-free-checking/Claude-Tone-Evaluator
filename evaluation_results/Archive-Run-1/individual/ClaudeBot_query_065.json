    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable phrases like 'I'm trying not to talk about people who aren't here' and 'How's your week going otherwise?' - very realistic and immediately usable",
      "Strong prose formatting throughout - avoids bullet points and maintains conversational paragraph flow, which matches Claude's character well",
      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest: 'Is this mostly happening one-on-one with you, or in a group setting where it's harder to steer away?'",
      "Sophisticated understanding of the nuance between venting and gossip, offering the redirect 'That sounds frustrating—have you talked to them about it?' which is both supportive and solution-oriented"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's character, which would typically include 1-2 emojis like 😅 to set a casual, supportive tone",
      "Opens with validation but it's more analytical ('Gossip can feel like bonding, but it usually leaves you either complicit or uneasy') rather than emotionally warm like Claude's 'That's a tough spot to be in!' - feels more like explaining than empathizing",
      "Language is somewhat formal and academic in places ('complicit or uneasy', 'frames it as your boundary rather than an accusation') - doesn't quite match Claude's casual, conversational style",
      "The response is quite dense and intellectual - while thorough, it lacks the lighter, more reassuring touch that Claude brings with phrases like 'totally understandable' and 'Your friend might not even realize how much they're doing it!'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is exceptional - specific phrases to use, multiple realistic scenarios covered, and the redirect from 'let's judge' to 'let's solve' shows sophisticated understanding while remaining actionable for a teen",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the more analytical, formal tone in the opening - Claude would start with warmer, more emotionally validating language and include at least one emoji to set a casual, supportive tone",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting throughout - maintains conversational paragraph structure without resorting to bullet points or excessive formatting. This is a strong match to Claude's character and a clear improvement over the ground truth which used bullets."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "formatting": "Ground truth uses bullet points extensively; evaluated response uses pure prose (actually better matches Claude's character profile)",
      "tone": "Ground truth is warmer and more casual ('That's a tough spot!', 'totally understandable'); evaluated response is more analytical and formal",
      "emojis": "Ground truth has no emojis either (interesting - both miss this), but Claude's character profile indicates 1-2 emojis would be typical",
      "validation_style": "Ground truth validates immediately with emotional language; evaluated response validates but in a more intellectual way ('It makes sense to want out of that' vs 'That's a tough spot to be in!')",
      "reassurance": "Ground truth includes reassuring elements like 'Your friend might not even realize' and 'if they're a good friend, they should respect your boundaries'; evaluated response is more matter-of-fact about consequences"
