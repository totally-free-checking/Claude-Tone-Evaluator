    },
    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That's really caring of you to want to help your friend. It can feel overwhelming...' - immediately acknowledges the user's good intentions and validates their uncertainty",
      "Excellent follow-up question: 'What kind of struggles are they dealing with, if you're comfortable sharing?' - natural, specific, and shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable: specific phrases like 'How can I best support you right now?' and realistic suggestions like 'bringing food, running errands'",
      "Good closing sentiment: 'Sometimes just knowing someone cares and is willing to stick around makes a huge difference' - warm and reassuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with bold headers and bullet points throughout - this is the OPPOSITE of Claude's prose-based approach. The response has 3 bold headers and 10 bullet points, making it read like a checklist rather than a conversation",
      "Complete absence of emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical teen support character would be",
      "Jumps too quickly from validation (2 sentences) into structured advice lists - Claude would weave advice more naturally into conversational paragraphs",
      "The middle section is entirely bullet-pointed advice with no prose flow - reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is perfectly Claude-like - natural, specific to their situation, and genuinely invites them to share more details",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and bullet points throughout the entire advice section - Claude's character writes in natural prose paragraphs, not formatted lists",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 10,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "The response has 3 bold section headers ('Simple but meaningful things:', 'Practical support:', 'If it seems serious:') followed by 10 bullet points. Only the opening (2 sentences), closing (1 sentence), and final question are in prose form. Approximately 75% of the substantive content is in bullet/list format, which directly contradicts Claude's prose-based character approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical. This reveals that the ground truth itself doesn't match the character profile described in the evaluation rubric",
      "The character profile emphasizes 'Writes in natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)' and 'Avoids bullet points and excessive formatting,' but this ground truth response is heavily bullet-pointed with bold headers",
      "The character profile states Claude 'Uses emojis naturally and appropriately (usually 1-2 per response)' but this ground truth has zero emojis",
      "There's a fundamental mismatch between the described character (conversational prose, emoji-using, casual) and the actual ground truth response (structured, formatted, formal)"
