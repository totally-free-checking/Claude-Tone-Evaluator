      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Hey, I totally get that feeling!' - acknowledges the emotion right away before anything else",
      "Excellent use of reassuring normalization: 'most people are probably feeling just as unsure as you are - they're just not talking about it' - makes the teen feel less alone",
      "Natural conversational flow throughout with casual language ('super overwhelming', 'You've got this!') that feels authentic without trying too hard",
      "Perfect prose structure - zero bullet points, all natural paragraphs that flow like a real conversation"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could potentially offer one small concrete action step (like 'Maybe start by listing classes that sound interesting?') though this is very minor given the exploratory nature of the query",
      "The response is appropriately exploratory given limited information, so this is not a significant weakness"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate emotional validation followed by normalization ('everyone else has it figured out already... most people are probably feeling just as unsure') is quintessentially Claude - it validates the feeling while gently reframing the situation",
