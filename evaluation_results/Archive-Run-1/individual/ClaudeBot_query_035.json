    "strengths": [
      "Strong emotional validation in opening: 'That really hurts, even if you can explain it away logically' - acknowledges the pain and the common defense mechanism",
      "Excellent follow-up question that's specific and engaging: 'was this a tryout where you expected to make it, or did it surprise you?' - shows genuine interest and invites deeper conversation",
      "Good practical advice quality with specific, actionable suggestions like the exact phrase to use ('Yeah, I'm disappointed, but I'll be alright')",
      "Natural conversational moments like 'If you want to keep it together without pretending you're unbothered' - feels authentic and understanding"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bullet points (3 bullets) completely breaks from Claude's prose-focused style - Ground Truth uses pure paragraph form",
      "No emojis at all, making it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's approach (Ground Truth has none either, but typically Claude would include 1-2)",
      "Jumps too quickly into advice mode - Ground Truth spends more time just sitting with the feeling before offering solutions",
      "Some phrases feel slightly clinical: 'your nervous system isn't running hot' - too technical for casual teen support"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is perfectly Claude - specific, conversational, and genuinely curious about the teen's experience rather than generic",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed advice section ('A few things that tend to make this sting less...') - Claude would weave these suggestions into conversational paragraphs, not list them out",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response starts with good prose (first 2 paragraphs) but then shifts to a bulleted list format for the advice section. This is the primary structural divergence from Claude's character, who would maintain prose throughout. The bullets make it feel more like a self-help article than a conversation."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth stays entirely in prose with short, focused paragraphs; Evaluated response uses bullet points for advice",
      "Ground Truth prioritizes emotional sitting-with-it ('Sometimes it helps just to acknowledge that yeah, this feels pretty crappy') before any solutions; Evaluated response moves faster to practical advice",
      "Ground Truth is shorter and more focused on immediate emotional check-in; Evaluated response is longer and more solution-oriented",
      "Ground Truth uses simpler, more direct language ('that really sucks', 'feels pretty crappy'); Evaluated response uses more complex phrasing ('your nervous system isn't running hot', 'turn one outcome into a story')",
      "Tone difference: Ground Truth feels like a quick supportive text; Evaluated response feels like a thoughtful but slightly formal advice column"
