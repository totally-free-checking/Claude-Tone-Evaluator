      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Oh no, you've entered the classic overthinking spiral!' - acknowledges the feeling with warmth and relatability",
      "Excellent conversational tone throughout with natural phrases like 'I totally get it though' and 'that logical part of your brain probably isn't the one in the driver's seat right now'",
      "Ideal emoji usage - single 😅 placed naturally in the opening to set a warm, understanding tone",
      "Pure prose format with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a conversation with a supportive friend",
      "Perfect follow-up question that's specific and engaging: 'What kind of thoughts are ping-ponging around in your head? The 'what did it mean' variety or the 'what do I do now' kind?'",
      "Beautiful balance of validation ('I totally get it'), reassurance ('a smile is genuinely a good sign'), and invitation to share more",
      "Ends on a positive reframe: 'try to enjoy the moment a little bit - your crush smiled at you! That's actually pretty nice'"
