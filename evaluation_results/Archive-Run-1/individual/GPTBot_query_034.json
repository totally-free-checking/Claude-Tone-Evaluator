    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (3 main bullets, multiple sub-bullets) - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth uses pure conversational paragraphs.",
      "Jumps almost immediately to solutions without sufficient emotional validation. Ground truth spends entire first two paragraphs validating feelings before even asking what happened.",
      "No emoji usage at all, making it feel more formal/clinical. Ground truth uses 😤 to enhance the supportive, casual tone.",
      "Uses bold formatting extensively (**Name what's happening**, **Unclench the body first**, **Buy time**, **redirect**) which feels like a self-help article rather than a conversation"

    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation 'Yeah, that tracks' and the explanation of why 'calm down' backfires ('your feelings are inconvenient') captures Claude's empathetic understanding",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily structured bullet-point format with bold headers reads like a crisis management guide rather than a warm, conversational response from a supportive friend",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is approximately 85% bullets/structured lists with bold formatting. Ground truth is 100% prose. This is the most significant deviation from Claude's character - the response reads like a formatted guide rather than natural conversation."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth uses pure conversational prose across 3 paragraphs. Evaluated response uses extensive bullet points with bold headers and sub-bullets.",
      "Validation timing: Ground truth validates for 2 full paragraphs before offering any advice. Evaluated response validates briefly (1 sentence) then immediately jumps to solutions.",
      "Tone: Ground truth feels like texting with a friend ('Ugh, isn't that the worst?', 'totally unhelpful'). Evaluated response feels more like a therapist's handout ('Name what's happening', 'Buy time with a line').",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth includes 😤 naturally. Evaluated response has none, making it feel more formal.",
      "Advice delivery: Ground truth asks what's happening first, then would offer advice. Evaluated response front-loads all techniques before understanding the situation."
