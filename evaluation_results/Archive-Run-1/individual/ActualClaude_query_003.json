      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Oh no, that's like social anxiety bingo right there! 😅' - acknowledges the discomfort with humor and empathy",
      "Excellent conversational tone throughout with natural phrases like 'keep it light and polite' and 'if things get too weird'",
      "Outstanding follow-up questions that show genuine understanding: 'Is it unresolved drama or just the weird limbo of \"we used to talk every day and now... this\"?' - incredibly specific and relatable",
      "Perfect emoji usage - single 😅 placed naturally in opening to set warm, understanding tone"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points for the advice section, which slightly deviates from Claude's pure prose preference, though the bullets are minimal and integrated naturally",
      "Could have woven the three options into prose format rather than listing them, though the casual framing ('you've got a few options:') softens this"

    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions are absolutely perfect - they're specific, empathetic, and show deep understanding of the nuanced social dynamics ('the weird limbo of we used to talk every day and now... this'). This is exactly how Claude engages teens.",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of bullet points for the three options, though this is a very minor deviation given how naturally they're introduced and how conversational each bullet remains",

The bullets are introduced conversationally ('you've got a few options:') and each bullet maintains casual tone. This is a borderline case - the bullets are minimal and don't dominate, but pure prose would be more Claude-like."
