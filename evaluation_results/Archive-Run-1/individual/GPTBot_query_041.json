    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'Ugh, that's genuinely annoying—without needing to be \"dramatic.\"' directly addresses the user's concern about being dramatic",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable: 'grab *anything* small—banana, granola bar, yogurt, crackers' gives concrete examples",
      "Good acknowledgment of the emotional component: 'Being hungry (or just thrown off your routine) makes everything feel louder' shows understanding"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with headers like '**Name it plainly:**' and '**Plan B options:**' - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "No emojis at all, making it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 😅",
      "The follow-up question feels transactional and formal: 'If you tell me where you are... I can help you pick the easiest plan' rather than Claude's casual 'Do you have any backup options nearby?'",
      "Overly structured with bold formatting throughout, reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation with a friend"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening line 'Ugh, that's genuinely annoying' captures Claude's immediate validation and casual tone perfectly",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive bullet-point structure with bold headers and sub-bullets - this is the exact opposite of Claude's natural prose approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by bullet points with bold headers. Only the opening paragraph and closing question are in prose form. Uses nested bullets under '**Plan B options:**' which creates a very structured, list-heavy feel. Claude's ground truth has zero bullets and flows entirely as conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Claude uses 3 flowing prose paragraphs; evaluated response uses 1 intro paragraph, 4 main bullet points with sub-bullets, and 1 closing question",
      "Emoji usage: Claude uses 😅 naturally in the first paragraph; evaluated response has zero emojis",
      "Tone: Claude is lighter and more playful ('live dangerously', 'You've got this!'); evaluated response is more serious and instructional ('low-effort ways to handle it without spiraling')",
      "Follow-up: Claude asks casual questions within the flow ('Do you have any backup options nearby?'); evaluated response ends with a formal conditional request ('If you tell me where you are... I can help')",
      "Length: Claude is concise (3 short paragraphs); evaluated response is longer and more comprehensive but feels like a guide rather than a conversation"
