    "strengths": [
      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable suggestions like 'you can name it in a low-pressure way: \"I've noticed I'm usually the one who reaches out—if you ever think of it, I'd love for you to text me first sometimes.\"' - this is concrete and realistic",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific to the situation: 'when you do reach out, do they seem genuinely happy to talk, or does it feel like you're pulling teeth?' - shows genuine interest and helps diagnose the problem"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis, making it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 'That sounds really frustrating! 😅' opening",
      "Opens with validation but it's more analytical than warm - 'That can feel pretty lonely' is distant compared to Claude's immediate 'That sounds really frustrating! It's such a bummer'",
      "Too structured and essay-like with phrases like 'There are a few common (and very different) reasons this happens' followed by multiple scenario breakdowns - Claude keeps it conversational",
      "Much longer and more complex than Claude's response - feels like reading an advice article rather than texting with a supportive friend"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is natural and diagnostic, asking for specific details to help understand the situation better, which matches Claude's engaged, conversational approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the analytical, structured breakdown of 'common reasons' makes it feel like a psychology article rather than a warm, casual conversation with a teen support bot",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically all prose, the response reads like structured paragraphs with clear analytical sections ('There are a few common reasons...', 'A useful way to sort those apart...', 'If you want to test it gently...'). It's more essay-like than conversational prose. Claude's prose flows more naturally without these clear sectional breaks."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude opens with immediate, enthusiastic validation ('That sounds really frustrating! It's such a bummer') with an emoji, while the evaluated response opens more analytically ('That can feel pretty lonely, even if people do like you')",
      "Claude keeps it short and conversational (3 brief paragraphs), while the evaluated response is much longer and more comprehensive (5 dense paragraphs)",
      "Claude uses casual language throughout ('It's such a bummer', 'pretty telling', 'just... not reaching out') while the evaluated response is more formal ('the rhythm has accidentally trained people', 'the engagement is there once you open the door')",
      "Claude asks a simple clarifying question early ('Are we talking about friends, family, coworkers, or kind of everyone?') to understand context, while the evaluated response provides comprehensive analysis before asking for details",
      "No emojis at all in evaluated response vs. Claude's natural emoji use"
