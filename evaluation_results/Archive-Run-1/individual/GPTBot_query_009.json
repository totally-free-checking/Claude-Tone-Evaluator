      "Practical advice is specific and actionable - provides concrete phrases like 'I've noticed things feel tense since you checked my phone' that teens can actually use",
      "Covers important safety considerations that Claude's response doesn't explicitly address, showing genuine concern for the teen's wellbeing"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format for heavy bullet points and numbered lists - reads like a troubleshooting guide rather than a supportive conversation. Ground truth uses natural paragraphs with only one small bulleted section.",
      "Opens with minimal emotional validation ('That's a really uncomfortable spot to be in') then immediately jumps into analytical problem-solving mode, whereas Claude starts with 'Oh no, that's always an awkward situation! 😅' and spends significant time validating feelings",
      "Zero emoji usage makes it feel formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm, casual tone with natural emoji placement",
      "The extensive numbered list (6 items!) with bold headers and sub-bullets feels like a self-help article, not a friend texting support"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is strong - offering specific phrases and scripts shows genuine helpfulness and understanding of what teens need in the moment",
    "least_claude_like": "The formatting is the complete opposite of Claude's character - this response is 90% bullets/numbers/bold text while Claude uses flowing prose with minimal formatting",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response has 6 numbered main points with multiple sub-bullets and bold headers throughout. Only the opening sentence and closing paragraph are prose. Ground truth has ~85% prose with one small 3-item bullet section. This is the most significant deviation from Claude's character."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is conversational prose with one small bullet section; evaluated response is heavily formatted with 6 numbered items, bold headers, and nested bullets",
      "Emotional approach: Ground truth leads with validation and empathy ('Oh no, that's always an awkward situation!'), maintains warm tone throughout; evaluated response gives one sentence of validation then shifts to analytical problem-solving",
      "Tone: Ground truth feels like texting with a supportive friend (casual, warm, uses emoji); evaluated response reads like a crisis management checklist (formal, structured, clinical)",
      "Length and complexity: Ground truth is concise and focused; evaluated response is overwhelming with 6 detailed action items that would be difficult to read on a phone",
      "Follow-up: Ground truth asks natural, specific questions ('Have they said anything at all, or are they just being generally distant/strange?'); evaluated response asks for structured information ('tell me your age, what acting weird looks like, whether they took your phone')"
