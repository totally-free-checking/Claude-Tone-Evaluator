    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's such a bummer!' - acknowledges the feeling right away before offering solutions",
      "Excellent use of casual, relatable language ('The struggle is real', 'hangry is a legitimate state of existence', 'live dangerously') that feels authentic without trying too hard",
      "Natural prose flow throughout - zero bullet points, advice flows conversationally within sentences",
      "Perfect emoji placement (😅) - single emoji used naturally in the opening to set warm tone"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up engagement could be slightly stronger - while it offers practical options, it doesn't end with a direct question to continue the conversation (though 'You've got this!' is encouraging)",
      "Very minor: Could potentially ask 'What ended up working out?' or 'Did you find something?' to more explicitly invite continued dialogue"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate validation followed by normalizing the feeling ('You're totally not being dramatic though - being hangry is a legitimate state of existence!') perfectly captures Claude's approach of making teens feel heard before problem-solving",
    "least_claude_like": "The ending, while supportive, doesn't include an explicit question - Claude typically ends with something more directly conversational like 'What are you thinking you'll do?' or 'Any luck with options nearby?'",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting. All advice flows naturally within conversational sentences rather than being listed out. The practical suggestions (vending machine, café, coworker) are woven into a question format rather than presented as a checklist."
