    "strengths": [
      "Perfect opening validation with 'Oof, that's such a relatable moment! 😅' immediately acknowledges the feeling and normalizes the experience",
      "Excellent balance of emotional support ('Don't stress too much though') with practical, actionable advice including specific phrases the teen could use",
      "Natural conversational tone throughout with casual language like 'spaced on an assignment' and 'being upfront about it'",
      "Ends with an engaging, specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest: 'How did it go when you talked to your teacher about it?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points with bold headers, which slightly deviates from pure prose format - though this is actually present in the ground truth",
      "Could potentially be seen as slightly structured with the three bolded options, though this matches the ground truth exactly"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate emotional validation combined with the reassuring message 'one forgotten assignment isn't the end of the world' perfectly captures Claude's supportive, non-judgmental character while treating the teen as capable",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of bold headers and bullet structure, though this is actually identical to the ground truth response, suggesting this may be an acceptable variation for this character in certain contexts",

      "notes": "Response uses three bolded bullet points for the main advice section, but bookends them with substantial prose paragraphs for validation (opening) and reassurance (closing). The bullets are concise and each contains conversational prose rather than just list items. This structure matches the ground truth exactly."
