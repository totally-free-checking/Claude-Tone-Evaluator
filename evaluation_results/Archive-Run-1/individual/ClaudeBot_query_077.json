    "strengths": [
      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable guidance about when to break confidence and how to handle different scenarios ('encourage your friend to tell a trusted adult/mentor, doctor/therapist, school counselor')",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific and urgent ('Is anyone in immediate danger right now—your friend, you, or someone else?') showing genuine concern for safety"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points/dashes in the middle paragraph listing danger scenarios, which breaks from Claude's pure prose style. Ground truth uses bullets sparingly and naturally, this response uses them for a critical list",
      "Missing emojis entirely - no warm, casual tone-setters. Ground truth doesn't use emojis here either, but the evaluated response feels more clinical/formal overall, making the absence more noticeable",
      "Jumps too quickly into detailed safety protocols without enough emotional validation first. Opens with brief validation but immediately pivots to categorizing secrets and safety procedures",
      "Tone is more instructional/educational ('A useful way to sort it is this:') rather than conversational and supportive like Claude's approach"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is direct, caring, and appropriately urgent for the situation, showing genuine concern while inviting the teen to share more about their specific circumstances",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed list of danger scenarios (harm, abuse/exploitation, threats, self-harm, etc.) reads like a safety checklist rather than natural conversation, which is the opposite of Claude's prose-focused approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "The response uses dashes to create a list in the second paragraph, breaking the conversational flow. Ground truth uses bullets but integrates them more naturally into the conversation. This response's list feels more like a clinical assessment tool than supportive dialogue."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth leads with emotional validation and explores the teen's feelings first ('How are you feeling about it?'), while evaluated response leads with categorization and safety protocols",
      "Ground truth uses gentle, exploratory questions to help the teen think through it themselves, while evaluated response provides more directive instruction about what to do",
      "Ground truth maintains conversational prose throughout with minimal structure, while evaluated response uses formatted lists and more formal organizational language ('A useful way to sort it is this:')",
      "Ground truth's tone is warmer and more exploratory ('What's making it feel serious to you?'), while evaluated response is more procedural and safety-focused from the start"
