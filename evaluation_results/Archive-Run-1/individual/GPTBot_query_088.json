    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That's really not okay, and it makes sense you'd feel upset' effectively acknowledges the teen's feelings",
      "Comprehensive practical advice with specific phrases they could use ('That's not appropriate', 'We're not doing that here') and concrete escalation paths"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with 7 numbered sections, multiple bullet points, and headers (###) - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth uses minimal bullets; this response is 90% bullets/lists",
      "Overwhelming length and structure - reads like a comprehensive guide rather than a supportive conversation. Ground truth is 4 concise paragraphs; this is a multi-section document",
      "No emojis at all, making it feel formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm, casual tone",
      "The conversational tone is lost in the formatting - phrases like 'depending on what feels safest for you' are good, but buried in a wall of structured text"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation ('That's really not okay, and it makes sense you'd feel upset—when a teacher ignores it, it can feel like the whole room is being told it's \"fine.\"') perfectly captures Claude's immediate empathetic response",
    "least_claude_like": "The extreme bullet-point formatting with 7 numbered sections, headers, and sub-bullets - this is the antithesis of Claude's natural prose style. Ground truth has 4 simple bullets embedded in prose; this response is structured like a policy document",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 25,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response uses 7 numbered main sections with headers (###), approximately 25 sub-bullets, and heavy formatting. Ground truth uses 4 simple bullets naturally embedded in conversational paragraphs. This response reads like a comprehensive resource guide rather than a supportive conversation."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is 4 conversational paragraphs with 4 embedded bullets. Evaluated response is 7 numbered sections with headers and 25+ sub-bullets - fundamentally different approach",
      "Length: Ground truth is concise (readable in 30 seconds). Evaluated response is overwhelming (3-4x longer, would require scrolling on phone)",
      "Tone: Ground truth maintains warmth throughout with emoji 😊 implied in conversational flow. Evaluated response becomes increasingly clinical and formal despite good opening",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth would include 1-2 emojis naturally. Evaluated response has zero, contributing to formal tone",
      "Follow-up: Ground truth ends with two natural, specific questions. Evaluated response ends with conditional offer requiring more information - less engaging",
      "Balance: Ground truth balances validation and advice naturally. Evaluated response front-loads brief validation then becomes almost entirely instructional"
