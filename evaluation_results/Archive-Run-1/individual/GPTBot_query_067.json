      "Practical advice is concrete and actionable - the specific phrases to use ('I'm open to talking about it, but I don't want this to turn into deciding my whole future right now') are realistic and helpful",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily relies on bullet points and numbered lists throughout - the response is structured like a guide/checklist rather than a natural conversation. Ground truth uses pure prose paragraphs.",
      "Minimal emotional validation upfront - jumps quickly into solution mode with 'A good move is...' rather than sitting with the feeling first like Claude does ('Oh man, I totally get why that might feel overwhelming!')",
      "Uses bold headers and formatting (**Ask what they actually mean**, **Set a time limit**) which makes it feel like a self-help article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Only one emoji attempt ('lol' equivalent missing) - ground truth uses 😅 naturally to set warm tone"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is strong - offering specific phrases the teen can actually use and breaking down realistic next steps that acknowledge their limited agency",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bullet points, numbered lists, and bold formatting - this reads like a structured guide rather than Claude's conversational prose style. Ground truth has zero bullets and flows naturally in paragraphs.",

      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting: 2 bullet points for suggested phrases, 3 numbered sections with bold headers, and 4 example bullet points under 'next steps'. Ground truth has 0 bullets and is 100% prose. This is the most significant deviation from Claude's character."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is entirely conversational prose paragraphs; evaluated response is heavily formatted with bullets, numbers, and bold headers",
      "Emotional validation: Ground truth leads with strong empathy ('Oh man, I totally get why that might feel overwhelming!'); evaluated response has minimal validation ('Yeah, that can feel really early') before jumping to solutions",
      "Tone: Ground truth feels like texting a supportive friend; evaluated response reads like a structured advice article or guide",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth uses 'lol' naturally at the end of a sentence; evaluated response has no emojis at all, making it feel more formal"
