    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is extremely thorough and actionable - the specific suggestions like 'picture your day backwards' and checking 'sticky spots' are concrete and helpful",
      "Does end with an engaging follow-up that asks for specific details (what, when, where) to provide more targeted help, showing genuine interest in continuing the conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format in favor of heavy bullet points, headers, and structured lists - reads like a crisis management guide rather than a supportive conversation. Ground truth uses pure prose paragraphs.",
      "Opens with minimal emotional validation ('That's really scary') then immediately jumps to solutions without sitting with the teen's feelings. Ground truth starts with 'Oh no, that's so stressful! I totally get why you're freaking out' and offers reassurance before advice.",
      "Zero emoji usage makes it feel formal and clinical compared to ground truth's warm 💙",
      "Overwhelming length and complexity - the response is 3-4x longer than ground truth with multiple sections, headers, and sub-bullets that would be exhausting to read on a phone during a stressful moment"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question asking for specific details (what you lost, when, where) is engaging and shows genuine interest in helping further, similar to Claude's conversational approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The entire formatting structure - multiple headers (### Do this in the next 10 minutes, ### Then immediately, ### If it's something high-stakes), numbered lists, bold text throughout, and bullet points everywhere. This is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose style.",

      "formatting": "Ground truth: 4 natural prose paragraphs. Evaluated response: 3 major sections with headers, 6 numbered items, multiple sub-bullets, bold text throughout",
      "emotional_approach": "Ground truth leads with strong validation ('Oh no, that's so stressful! I totally get why you're freaking out') and reassurance ('You're gonna be okay'). Evaluated response has minimal validation and jumps straight to action items",
      "length": "Ground truth: ~80 words, readable in 30 seconds. Evaluated response: ~350 words with complex structure, would take 2-3 minutes to parse",
      "tone": "Ground truth: warm, conversational, feels like texting a friend ('Take a deep breath for a sec - we can figure this out together'). Evaluated response: instructional, clinical, feels like a crisis manual",
