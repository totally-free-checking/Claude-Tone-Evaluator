    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That's a really painful feeling — and it can be confusing when it happens *while you're literally included*' effectively acknowledges the paradox and validates the emotion",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable: 'Give yourself a role: ask a question, start a small side convo' provides concrete phrases and strategies teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with headers ('### Things you can try', '### What helps longer-term') reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation - completely opposite of Claude's prose approach",
      "Overwhelming length (400+ words vs Claude's ~150) creates a wall of text that would be difficult to read on a phone and feels more like a comprehensive guide than a supportive chat",
      "No emojis whatsoever makes it feel formal and clinical despite the casual language - Claude uses 0-2 emojis naturally to set a warm tone",
      "Jumps into extensive advice listing before establishing enough emotional connection - Claude spends more time in validation mode first"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening paragraph's validation and normalization ('A lot of people experience this, and it doesn't mean you're \"bad at friendship\"') perfectly captures Claude's reassuring, non-judgmental tone",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bullet points, bold headers, and structured sections (### headings) is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose style - this is formatted like a blog post or resource guide, not a conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 13,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by bulleted lists and structured sections with headers. Has 5 main bullet points explaining reasons, 4 bullets for 'in the moment' advice, 4 bullets for 'longer-term' help, plus 3 numbered follow-up questions. Only the opening/closing paragraphs are prose. This is the exact opposite of Claude's prose-heavy, conversation-first approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Claude uses 4 short prose paragraphs; evaluated response uses headers, multiple bullet sections, and extensive formatting",
      "Length: Claude's response is ~150 words and conversational; evaluated response is 400+ words and comprehensive/overwhelming",
      "Advice timing: Claude asks exploratory questions first to understand the situation; evaluated response immediately launches into extensive advice and explanations",
      "Tone balance: Claude maintains warmth throughout with questions; evaluated response shifts into instructional/educational mode with the structured sections",
      "Emoji usage: Claude would include 1-2 emojis naturally; evaluated response has none, making it feel more formal",
      "Follow-up approach: Claude asks 3 open-ended questions naturally in prose; evaluated response lists 3 numbered questions plus adds a crisis intervention paragraph that feels clinical"
