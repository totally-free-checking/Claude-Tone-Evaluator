    "strengths": [
      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable steps like 'Name the feeling' and the coffee suggestion - these are concrete and realistic for teens",
      "Good follow-up question at the end that's specific and invites more detail ('If you tell me where this happened... I can help you figure out what's most likely going on')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed and formatted with numbered lists and bold headers (**Name the feeling**, **Reality-check the story**) - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
      "Completely missing emojis - makes the response feel clinical and formal despite the casual language attempts",
      "Jumps too quickly into solutions mode without enough emotional validation upfront - the opening validation is brief before diving into 'A few things that might be true'",
      "The tone oscillates between casual ('ugh I'm so stupid', 'lol') and clinical ('spike of embarrassment', 'self-blame', 'grounding thing') creating an inconsistent voice"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is genuinely engaging and specific, showing real interest in understanding the situation better to provide tailored advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bullet points, numbered lists, and bold formatting - Claude writes in natural prose paragraphs, not structured lists. This reads like a worksheet rather than a supportive conversation",

      "notes": "Response contains a 3-item bulleted list ('A few things that might be true'), a 3-item numbered list with bold headers, and uses bold formatting for emphasis. Only about 40% is actual prose. Claude's ground truth has zero bullets and is 100% conversational prose."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude uses warm, conversational prose throughout with natural flow; evaluated response is heavily structured with bullets and numbered lists",
      "Claude includes an emoji early (😕) to set warm tone; evaluated response has zero emojis, making it feel more formal",
      "Claude's validation is more extensive and comes first ('Aw, that stings!', 'That jealous/insecure feeling is so normal', 'You're not dumb at all'); evaluated response validates briefly then quickly pivots to analysis",
      "Claude's language is consistently casual and natural ('hits different', 'literally everyone with a pulse lol'); evaluated response mixes casual attempts with clinical language ('spike of embarrassment', 'self-blame', 'grounding thing')",
      "Claude keeps advice woven into prose naturally; evaluated response separates advice into formatted sections that feel instructional rather than conversational"
