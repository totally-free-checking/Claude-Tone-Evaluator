    "strengths": [
      "Strong practical advice with specific phrases to use: 'I care about you, and I also spend time with other people. What part of this upset you?' - this is concrete and actionable",
      "Good use of prose paragraphs throughout, avoiding bullet points and maintaining conversational flow",
      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question that shows genuine interest in understanding the situation better",
      "Nuanced analysis of the situation, distinguishing between valid feelings and unreasonable expectations"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - feels too formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm, casual approach with 😅 or similar",
      "Jumps straight into analysis without immediate emotional validation - no 'That sounds tough!' or 'Oof, that's rough' opening",
      "Tone is more like a therapist or counselor than a supportive friend - uses clinical language like 'separate two things,' 'patterns,' 'firm up boundaries'",
      "Too long and dense for a teen audience - four substantial paragraphs that feel more like an article than a text conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is natural and specific, genuinely trying to understand the nuance of the situation rather than being generic",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of warmth and validation at the start - Claude immediately acknowledges feelings ('That sounds like a tricky situation!') while this response launches into analytical framework",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting with no bullet points. However, the prose itself reads more academic/therapeutic than conversational, with complex sentence structures and formal transitions"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude starts with immediate validation ('That sounds like a tricky situation!') while the evaluated response starts with analytical framing ('That's a really common kind of conflict')",
      "Claude uses warm, casual language throughout ('tough when friends get upset') while the evaluated response uses clinical terminology ('controlling expectation,' 'firm up boundaries,' 'patterns')",
      "Claude includes an emoji (implied warm tone) and keeps it conversational, while the evaluated response has zero emojis and reads more formal",
      "Claude's response is shorter and more digestible (3 paragraphs) while the evaluated response is denser and longer (4 substantial paragraphs)",
      "Claude focuses on understanding and connection first ('Have you two talked about why they're upset?') while the evaluated response leads with boundary-setting framework",
      "Claude's tone is 'supportive older sibling' while the evaluated response reads more like 'therapist giving a session'"
