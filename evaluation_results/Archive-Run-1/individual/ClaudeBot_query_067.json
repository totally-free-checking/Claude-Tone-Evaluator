    "strengths": [
      "Good prose structure throughout - avoids bullet points and maintains paragraph flow, which matches Claude's style",
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable, particularly the suggested phrase 'I'm willing to talk about it, but I don't want to make big decisions yet'",
      "Ends with an engaging follow-up question that invites the teen to share more about their specific concerns",
      "Length is appropriate - substantial enough to be helpful without being overwhelming"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with 'That's pretty normal' which is somewhat dismissive compared to Claude's immediate emotional validation ('Oh man, I totally get why that might feel overwhelming!')",
      "Completely lacks emojis - feels more formal and less warm than Claude's natural emoji use (Claude used 'lol' at the end)",
      "Tone is more analytical and explanatory ('because it's the moment when classes, activities, and grades start counting') rather than empathetic and relatable",
      "Jumps into explaining parent psychology before really validating the teen's feelings - Claude validates first, explains second"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose-based structure and the specific, actionable phrase suggestion ('I'm willing to talk about it, but I don't want to make big decisions yet') matches Claude's approach of giving teens exact words they can use",
    "least_claude_like": "The opening lacks warmth and immediate emotional validation - starting with 'That's pretty normal' feels more like a therapist analyzing the situation than a friend saying 'I get you'",

      "notes": "Excellent prose structure throughout. No bullet points or excessive formatting. This is one of the strongest aspects matching Claude's style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude opens with strong emotional validation ('Oh man, I totally get why that might feel overwhelming!') while the evaluated response opens with analytical framing ('That's pretty normal, even if it feels early')",
      "Claude uses natural casual language and an emoji/lol, creating warmth; the evaluated response is more formal and explanatory throughout",
      "Claude validates the feeling FIRST ('It's like they're already fast-forwarding to the future when you're still figuring out high school, right?') before explaining parent motivations; the evaluated response leads with parent psychology",
      "Claude's tone is more conversational and relatable ('like, you'll have more time', 'what kind of campus environment sounds cool') while the evaluated response is more instructional ('information-gathering talk', 'set yourself up with options')",
      "Claude includes a playful element ('or even just watching some college movies together lol') that the evaluated response lacks entirely"
