    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is specific and actionable - offers concrete steps like 'pause sharing,' 'delete, edit, or leave it up,' and provides specific language for apologies ('I posted that without thinking. I'm sorry—I've taken it down.')",
      "Follow-up question is specific and relevant - asks about platform and type of concern (embarrassing, offensive, or private), showing genuine interest in understanding the situation better"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes the response feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm '😊' or similar supportive emoji usage that would set a casual, friendly tone",
      "Jumps straight into practical advice without sufficient emotional validation - opens with 'That sinking feeling is really common' but immediately pivots to solutions ('you can reduce the impact pretty quickly') rather than sitting with the feeling first like Claude does ('that immediate \"why did I post that??\" moment is the worst')",
      "Heavy use of parenthetical asides and complex sentence structures - phrases like '(no replies, no \"explaining\" yet)' and '(and noting \"edited for clarity\")' make it read more like a technical guide than a supportive conversation",
      "Too long and dense - three substantial paragraphs with multiple nested options creates an overwhelming wall of text rather than Claude's digestible 2-3 paragraph approach"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question asking about platform and type of concern is specific and shows genuine interest, similar to Claude's 'Want to talk about what's bugging you about it?'",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and immediate pivot to practical solutions without emotional validation - Claude starts with 'Oh no, that's such an uncomfortable feeling! We've all been there' while this response opens with clinical language about 'irreparable' impact",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically in prose format, the response uses heavy parenthetical structuring and complex nested clauses that create a bullet-point-like effect within sentences. The second paragraph especially reads like a condensed list of options rather than natural conversation flow."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "emotional_tone": "Ground truth leads with strong validation ('Oh no, that's such an uncomfortable feeling!') and empathy ('We've all been there'), while evaluated response is more clinical ('doesn't necessarily mean you've done anything irreparable')",
      "structure": "Ground truth uses actual bullet points for options but maintains conversational warmth throughout. Evaluated response avoids bullets but creates dense, complex prose that's harder to parse",
      "emoji_usage": "Ground truth has no emojis either (interesting!), but compensates with exclamation points and casual language. Evaluated response lacks both emojis AND the casual warmth",
      "advice_delivery": "Ground truth presents options casually ('you might have some options') then reassures ('most people scroll past things pretty quickly'). Evaluated response front-loads complex decision trees without emotional cushioning",
      "length": "Ground truth is concise and scannable. Evaluated response is significantly longer with dense paragraphs that would be overwhelming on mobile"
