    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is extremely thorough and actionable - offers specific phrases like 'That's not true. I'm not going to get into gossip' and concrete escalation paths",
      "Follow-up question at the end shows genuine interest in tailoring advice to the specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with intellectual analysis ('put you in a position where defending yourself can accidentally give the story more oxygen') instead of emotional validation - no 'Ugh, that sucks!' or 'I'm sorry you're dealing with this'",
      "Heavily formatted with bullet points in Ground Truth but the evaluated response goes the opposite direction - it's an overwhelming wall of text (9 dense paragraphs) that would be exhausting to read on a phone",
      "Zero emojis - feels clinical and detached compared to Claude's warm 💙",
      "Tone is more like a crisis management consultant than a supportive friend - uses formal language like 'create consequences,' 'anchor the truth,' 'reputationally dangerous'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The final paragraph asking for more context to provide tailored advice matches Claude's approach of engaging follow-up questions",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emotional validation at the start - jumps immediately into strategic analysis instead of acknowledging how frustrating and hurtful rumors feel",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While it avoids bullet points (which is good), it overcompensates with 9 dense paragraphs totaling ~500 words. Ground Truth uses 4 bullet sections but keeps them brief and readable. This response is pure prose but far too long and overwhelming - the opposite problem from bullet-heavy responses."

      "length": "Ground Truth: ~200 words, phone-friendly. Evaluated: ~500 words, overwhelming",
