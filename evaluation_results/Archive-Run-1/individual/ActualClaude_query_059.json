    "strengths": [
      "Perfect emotional validation opening: 'That sounds really frustrating! It's such a bummer when you feel like you're putting in all the effort' - immediately validates feelings with warm, casual language",
      "Excellent prose structure throughout - zero bullet points, natural conversational flow across three well-balanced paragraphs",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and engaging: 'Are we talking about friends, family, coworkers, or kind of everyone?' - shows genuine interest and invites elaboration",
      "Perfect balance of validation and practical advice: validates first, explains context (communication styles), then offers actionable suggestion (not reaching out experiment)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing emojis entirely - Claude's ground truth also lacks emojis here, but the character profile suggests 1-2 emojis are typical, especially early on to set warm tone (e.g., 'That sounds really frustrating! 😅')",
      "Could potentially benefit from slightly more specific language in the practical advice section - the 'not reaching out for a bit' suggestion is good but could include a timeframe or more concrete framing"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate emotional validation combined with casual, natural language ('It's such a bummer', 'I totally get why') perfectly captures Claude's warm, conversational teen support character",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis - while the ground truth also lacks them, this is slightly atypical for the character profile which emphasizes natural emoji usage (1-2 per response) to enhance warmth",
