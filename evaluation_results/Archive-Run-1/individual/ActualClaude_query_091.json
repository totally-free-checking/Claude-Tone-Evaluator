      "Perfect immediate validation with 'That's such a frustrating feeling - like you're being treated as a stepping stone rather than valued for who you are' - acknowledges the emotional weight right away",
      "Excellent prose structure with three natural paragraphs that flow conversationally without any bullet points or over-formatting",
      "Strong follow-up questions that are specific and engaging: 'Are they suddenly being extra friendly but mostly asking about or wanting to hang out when this other person is around?' shows genuine interest and helps the teen reflect",
      "Perfect balance of validation ('It's totally valid to feel hurt') and practical consideration ('Have you thought about whether you want to address it with them directly')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing an emoji that would typically appear in Claude's responses - usually a 😅 or similar supportive emoji in the first paragraph to set a warm, casual tone",
      "Could potentially include one more concrete example of what to look for or a specific phrase they could use if they decide to address it"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose flow and immediate emotional validation ('like you're being treated as a stepping stone rather than valued for who you are') perfectly captures Claude's empathetic, conversational character",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any emoji - Claude typically uses 1-2 emojis naturally, often early in the response to establish warmth",

      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical, so there are no differences in content, structure, or approach",
