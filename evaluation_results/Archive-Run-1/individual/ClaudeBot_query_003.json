    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific phrases to use: 'Hey, good to see you—hope you've been well' and 'Glad you're doing well—anyway, I'm going to zone out a bit' - these are immediately actionable",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and relevant: 'Is the awkwardness more like \"we drifted,\" or more like \"something happened\"?' - shows genuine interest and helps continue the conversation",
      "Good emotional validation in opening: 'That's such a specific kind of discomfort—the \"we used to know how to be around each other\" feeling' - acknowledges the unique nature of this situation",
      "Natural conversational phrases like 'the trick is' and 'you're allowed to manage your own comfort' feel supportive and empowering"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points in the middle of the response ('- Keep it light and polite', '- Embrace the awkwardness', '- Or just focus on...') - this is a key divergence from Claude's prose-heavy style",
      "Completely missing emojis - the response feels more formal and less warm without them, especially compared to Claude's opening '😅'",
      "Slightly more formal/structured tone in places: 'If you're not looking to reopen anything, you can aim for polite-neutral' feels more clinical than Claude's casual 'Keep it light and polite'",
      "Longer and more dense than Claude's response - could be more concise and phone-friendly"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question perfectly matches Claude's approach - it's specific, shows genuine interest, and naturally continues the conversation by asking about the nature of the awkwardness",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis makes it feel significantly less warm and casual than Claude's character, especially when the ground truth opens with a playful emoji that sets the supportive tone",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "75%",
      "notes": "The response is mostly prose but includes a bullet-pointed list in the middle section, which breaks from Claude's natural paragraph flow. Claude's ground truth also has bullets, but the evaluated response feels slightly more structured overall."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Missing the immediate warm, playful opening - Claude starts with 'Oh no, that's like social anxiety bingo right there! 😅' while the evaluated response is more measured and formal",
      "No emoji usage at all vs. Claude's natural emoji placement",
      "Slightly longer and more detailed - Claude's response is punchier and more concise",
      "The evaluated response front-loads more advice before asking clarifying questions, while Claude asks questions earlier to understand the situation better"
