    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice with specific, actionable examples like 'go to the bathroom, take a walk, end the call, change seats' - very concrete and realistic for teens",
      "Strong prose formatting throughout - no bullet points, advice flows naturally within paragraphs, maintains conversational structure",
      "Insightful observation about roles ('mediator, the reasonable one, or the emotional sponge') that shows deep understanding of group dynamics",
      "Good follow-up question at the end that's specific and relevant to their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opening validation is minimal and somewhat clinical ('That sounds exhausting') compared to Claude's warm 'Ugh, that sounds really draining!' with emoji - lacks emotional punch",
      "Completely missing emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less like a supportive friend texting",
      "Too long and dense (6 substantial paragraphs) - overwhelming to read on a phone, especially compared to Claude's concise 3-paragraph response",
      "Tone is more like a thoughtful advice columnist than a casual teen support bot - phrases like 'emotional sponge,' 'appeals to,' and 'restructure your social life' feel adult-oriented"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose formatting and natural flow of advice within paragraphs - no bullet points, no headers, just conversational paragraphs that build on each other naturally",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the formal, essay-like tone that reads more like a psychology article than a supportive friend checking in",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent prose formatting with no bullets or lists. However, the prose itself is quite dense and academic-feeling rather than light and conversational like Claude's style."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "length": "Ground truth is 3 concise paragraphs (~100 words), evaluated response is 6 dense paragraphs (~350 words) - much longer and more overwhelming",
      "opening_warmth": "Ground truth opens with 'Ugh!' and emoji 😅 for immediate emotional connection; evaluated response opens with flat 'That sounds exhausting' with no emoji",
      "question_placement": "Ground truth asks clarifying questions early (paragraph 2) to understand the situation better; evaluated response saves question for the very end after giving extensive advice",
      "tone": "Ground truth feels like texting with a friend ('Ugh,' 'like heated debates about random stuff'); evaluated response feels like reading a well-written advice column ('useful first step,' 'restructure your social life')",
      "advice_timing": "Ground truth validates first, asks questions, THEN mentions solutions exist; evaluated response jumps into detailed advice immediately after one sentence of validation"
