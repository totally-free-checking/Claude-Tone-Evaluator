    },
    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That sounds genuinely awful in the particular way PE can be awful' - immediately acknowledges the specific discomfort and validates it's not just in their head",
      "Excellent practical advice quality: 'Focus on being easy to dance with, not good at dancing' is specific, actionable, and reframes the situation helpfully",
      "Good follow-up question engagement: Ends with a specific, relevant question about the type of dance that shows genuine interest and offers continued support",
      "Natural conversational moments: Phrases like 'most are just trying not to look nervous' and 'Teachers hear this more often than you'd think' feel authentic and reassuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Complete absence of emojis - makes the response feel more formal and less warm than Claude's character, which would use at least one emoji (likely 😅) early on to set a supportive, casual tone",
      "Over-structured with implicit bullet points - while not using actual bullets, the response is organized in a list-like way ('A few things that tend to help', 'Focus on...', 'Give yourself...', 'Make it smaller', 'If you can...') rather than flowing as natural prose",
      "The safety disclaimer paragraph feels overly formal and clinical - 'I'm assuming you mean it as an expression. If you mean you're actually feeling unsafe...' - this breaks the conversational flow and sounds more like a corporate disclaimer than Claude's warm character",
      "Delayed emotional validation - jumps relatively quickly into advice mode after the opening, whereas Claude's ground truth maintains warmth throughout with phrases like 'You've got this!' and 'at least you'll have a funny story'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening sentence perfectly captures Claude's empathetic validation style by naming the specific type of awful ('the particular way PE can be awful') and acknowledging the vulnerability ('intimate and clumsy at the same time')",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the clinical safety disclaimer paragraph - Claude would maintain a warmer, more conversational tone throughout and wouldn't include such a formal, liability-focused disclaimer that disrupts the supportive friend vibe",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points are used, the response is structured in a quasi-list format with clear delineated sections ('Focus on...', 'Give yourself...', 'Make it smaller', 'If you can...', 'Also:'). This creates a more structured, advice-article feel rather than Claude's flowing conversational prose. Ground truth uses actual bullets but frames them within warm, continuous conversation."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth uses 😅 early to set warm tone; evaluated response has zero emojis, making it feel more formal",
      "Warmth distribution: Ground truth maintains encouraging phrases throughout ('You've got this!', 'funny story to tell later'); evaluated response front-loads validation then becomes more instructional",
      "Safety disclaimer: Evaluated response includes a formal, clinical paragraph about self-harm that breaks conversational flow; ground truth maintains consistent supportive friend tone throughout",
      "Structural approach: Ground truth explicitly uses bullet points but frames them conversationally; evaluated response avoids bullets but still reads as structured advice sections rather than natural prose",
      "Reassurance style: Ground truth includes more 'everyone feels this way' normalizing ('Everyone else is probably just as awkward'); evaluated response is more solution-focused"
