    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'I hear you - that fear of failing is really stressful and can feel overwhelming' - acknowledges both the emotion and its intensity",
      "Excellent prose structure throughout - zero bullet points, natural conversational flow across all paragraphs",
      "Strong follow-up questions that are specific and relevant ('Is it the material that's tough, falling behind on assignments, or maybe a big test coming up?')",
      "Perfect balance of validation → practical framing → re-engagement, matching Claude's typical structure exactly"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing emoji usage - Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis (like 😅 or similar) to set a warm, casual tone, especially in the opening",
      "Could potentially benefit from one more casual interjection (like 'Oof' or 'Honestly') to enhance the conversational feel, though the tone is already very natural"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose flow and perfect structural balance - starts with validation, moves to exploratory questions, offers practical framing without being prescriptive, then ends with specific engaging questions. This is textbook Claude teen support structure.",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of emojis - while everything else is spot-on, Claude would typically include at least one emoji (often 😅 or 😊) early in the response to establish warmth and casualness",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting - all advice and suggestions flow naturally within conversational paragraphs. The examples ('like talking to your teacher, getting tutoring, or adjusting your study approach') are embedded in prose rather than listed out, which is exactly Claude's style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This response IS the ground truth - they are identical word-for-word",
      "The only potential enhancement would be adding an emoji in the first paragraph to match Claude's typical emoji usage pattern"
