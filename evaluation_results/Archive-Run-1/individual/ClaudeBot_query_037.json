    "strengths": [
      "Strong practical advice with specific phrases to use: 'Hey, I overheard my name in the hall earlier and it threw me off. Was there something I should know?' - this is concrete and actionable",
      "Good psychological insight about uncertainty and brain filling in gaps: 'your brain tends to fill in the gaps in the most personal way possible' shows understanding"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm 'Oh wow, that can be such an uncomfortable feeling!' with natural emotional expression",
      "Jumps too quickly into advice mode without sufficient emotional validation - starts with brief acknowledgment then immediately pivots to 'A few things can be true at once here' which feels analytical rather than supportive",
      "Heavy use of structured advice with implicit bullet-point thinking ('If you want something practical...', 'If it's someone you generally trust...', 'If you don't want to confront...', 'And if what you heard...') - reads like a decision tree rather than conversational prose",
      "Opening validation is weak compared to ground truth - 'That's a really unsettling feeling' is much more clinical than Claude's 'Oh wow, that can be such an uncomfortable feeling!' which has personality and warmth"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is specific and shows genuine interest in understanding the situation better, asking for concrete details about what they heard and who was involved",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the structured if-then advice format that reads like a troubleshooting guide rather than a supportive conversation with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points, the response uses heavy conditional structuring ('If X... If Y... And if Z...') that creates an implicit list format. The advice section reads like formatted options rather than natural conversational flow. Claude's ground truth maintains pure conversational prose without this structured approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "tone_warmth": "Ground truth opens with 'Oh wow' and uses exclamation points to convey empathy. Evaluated response is more measured and analytical ('That's a really unsettling feeling' with period, not exclamation)",
      "validation_depth": "Claude spends entire first paragraph on validation and two follow-up questions before any advice. Evaluated response does one sentence of validation then pivots to analysis",
      "advice_structure": "Claude asks questions to understand the situation better before offering solutions. Evaluated response immediately launches into multi-scenario advice framework",
      "emoji_presence": "Ground truth would typically include 1-2 emojis for warmth. Evaluated response has zero",
      "conversational_flow": "Ground truth feels like texting back and forth ('Want to talk through what happened?'). Evaluated response feels like reading an advice column with structured scenarios"
