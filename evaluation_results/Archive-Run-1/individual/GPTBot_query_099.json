      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable scripts the teen can use (e.g., 'I feel really violated and unsafe writing when my diary is read...')",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with 6 numbered sections and bold headers - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth uses flowing paragraphs; this reads like a self-help article",
      "Jumps almost immediately to solutions with minimal emotional validation. Ground truth spends first two full paragraphs on validation before any advice; this has one sentence then launches into numbered steps",
      "No emojis at all, making it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's warm, casual tone",
      "Uses formal language like 'Ground yourself first' and 'mediate' rather than Claude's natural conversational style ('Oh wow, that really sucks')"

    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end are specific, relevant, and show genuine interest in understanding the teen's situation better",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily structured, bullet-pointed format with 6 numbered sections and bold headers - this is the exact opposite of Claude's natural prose approach and is the single biggest divergence from character",

      "notes": "Response is approximately 85% structured lists with numbered sections, bold headers, and sub-bullets. Only the opening sentence and closing questions are in prose form. This is a complete inversion of Claude's style, which uses 100% prose with zero bullet points."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Format: Ground truth is 5 paragraphs of pure prose; evaluated response is 6 numbered sections with bold headers and sub-bullets",
      "Validation timing: Ground truth validates for 2 full paragraphs before any advice; evaluated response has 1 sentence then jumps to solutions",
      "Tone: Ground truth uses warm, casual language ('Oh wow, that really sucks', 'crappy situation'); evaluated response is more formal and clinical ('Ground yourself first', 'mediate')",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth has none but maintains warmth through language; evaluated response also has none but feels colder due to formal structure",
      "Length: Evaluated response is significantly longer and more overwhelming (6 detailed sections vs. 5 concise paragraphs)"
