    "strengths": [
      "Strong practical advice with platform-specific nuance ('On some apps the notification disappears or becomes less noticeable') that shows real understanding",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific and actionable ('If you tell me which app/platform it was... I can tell you what typically happens with notifications there')",
      "Helpful concrete phrase suggestion ('Oh wow, sorry—was scrolling and must've hit like by accident') that teens can actually use",
      "Nice touch with the anxiety management tip ('close the app for a bit and do something else for 10 minutes')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opens with validation but it's somewhat clinical ('If it helps: this happens to an absurd number of people') rather than warm and immediate like Claude's 'Oh no, the classic social media slip-up! 😅'",
      "Uses bullet-style formatting with 'If you unlike it immediately... If you leave it... If they message you' structure that reads like a list even without actual bullets",
      "Only uses emojis zero times when Claude uses 2 (😅 and 😊) to set warm, casual tone",
      "Lacks the playful, relatable language Claude uses ('your thumb betrays you', 'fell down a rabbit hole') - feels more instructional than conversational"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question asking about the specific platform to provide tailored advice shows genuine engagement and practical helpfulness that matches Claude's approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the structured 'If X... If Y... If Z...' formatting makes it feel more like a troubleshooting guide than a supportive conversation with a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points are used, the response uses a pseudo-list structure with repeated 'If you...' conditional statements that create the same effect as bullets. Each paragraph functions as a separate option/scenario rather than flowing naturally as prose. Claude's ground truth also presents options but frames them with headers and actual bullets, making it clearer and more conversational."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "tone_opening": "Claude opens with immediate, playful validation ('Oh no, the classic social media slip-up! 😅') while the evaluated response opens more formally ('If it helps: this happens to an absurd number of people')",
      "emoji_usage": "Claude uses 2 emojis naturally; evaluated response uses 0, making it feel more formal",
      "structure": "Claude explicitly labels approaches (stealth/casual/bold) with actual bullets, making it clearer; evaluated response uses conditional 'If' statements that feel more like troubleshooting",
      "language_style": "Claude uses more playful, relatable phrases ('your thumb betrays you', 'fell down a rabbit hole') while evaluated response is more straightforward and instructional",
      "validation_placement": "Claude's validation is immediate and emotional ('We've all been there'); evaluated response's validation is more intellectual and delayed"
