    "strengths": [
      "Excellent warmth and validation - 'Oh man, that racing brain feeling is the worst!' immediately validates the experience with empathetic, relatable language",
      "Perfect follow-up question - 'What kind of vibe are you in right now - want to try calming down, or need more of a distraction approach?' is natural, specific, and genuinely engaging",
      "Strong conversational tone throughout - uses natural phrases like 'word-vomit', 'ping-ponging around', 'sounds silly but it actually works' that feel authentic",
      "Excellent practical advice quality - specific, actionable suggestions like the 4-7-8 breathing technique with exact numbers, concrete examples like 'organizing something small like your desk drawer'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy bullet point formatting with bold headers - 'A few things that might help:' followed by four bolded bullet points (**Quick brain dump**, **The 4-7-8 breathing thing**, etc.) is the opposite of Claude's prose-based approach",
      "Complete absence of emojis - no emojis at all makes it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's typical style, which would include 1-2 supportive emojis like 😅",
      "Over-structured presentation - the bold headers and bullet format reads like a self-help article rather than a conversational text exchange"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and closing follow-up question are perfectly Claude - warm, empathetic, conversational, and genuinely engaging without being patronizing",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and bullet points throughout the middle section - this structured, list-based formatting is explicitly against Claude's character, which favors natural prose paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response has clear 'A few things that might help:' setup followed by 4 bolded bullet points with headers. Only the opening paragraph and closing two paragraphs are in prose form. The advice section (which is the bulk of the response) is entirely bullet-formatted with bold headers, making it read like a structured list rather than conversational advice woven into natural paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical word-for-word, including the bullet point formatting and bold headers",
      "The ground truth itself contains heavy bullet formatting, which contradicts the stated character profile that emphasizes prose over bullets",
      "Missing emojis that the character profile indicates should be present (1-2 per response, typically early on)"
