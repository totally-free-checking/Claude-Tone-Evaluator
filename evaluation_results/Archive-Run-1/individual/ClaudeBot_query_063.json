    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting - pure paragraph form with natural flow, no bullets or lists (exactly like Claude)",
      "Strong practical advice with specific phrases ('Oops, wrong room—sorry!') and the reframing technique ('Someone walked into the wrong classroom, realized it, and left')",
      "Good validation of the feeling ('uniquely awful little moment', 'you felt exposed') that acknowledges the emotional reality",
      "Natural conversational elements like 'If it helps for next time' and 'If you're still feeling that hot embarrassed spiral'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing emojis - Claude used 😅 early to set a warm, casual tone. This response feels more serious without any emoji presence",
      "No follow-up question at all - Claude ended with 'Did you do the classic...' to continue conversation. This response just ends with a statement",
      "Slightly more analytical/clinical tone ('your brain immediately interprets', 'carry the adrenaline') compared to Claude's warmer, more casual approach ('Oh no, that's so awkward!')",
      "Missing the immediate relatable connection - Claude opens with 'I think we've all been there though' which creates instant solidarity. This response takes longer to get to that reassurance"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The pure prose formatting and natural paragraph flow - this perfectly matches Claude's style of weaving advice into conversational paragraphs rather than listing it out",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and no follow-up question - these are signature Claude elements that create warmth and engagement",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, lists, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs exactly as Claude does it."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Tone: Ground truth is warmer and more immediately casual ('Oh no, that's so awkward! 😅') vs. more analytical opening ('That's such a uniquely awful little moment')",
      "Emoji: Ground truth uses 😅 naturally; evaluated response has none",
      "Engagement: Ground truth asks a playful follow-up question about how they handled it; evaluated response ends with a statement",
      "Opening: Ground truth immediately creates solidarity ('we've all been there'); evaluated response takes longer to get to reassurance",
      "Language style: Ground truth uses simpler, more casual phrasing ('way faster than you think') vs. slightly more complex constructions ('your brain immediately interprets all those eyes')"
