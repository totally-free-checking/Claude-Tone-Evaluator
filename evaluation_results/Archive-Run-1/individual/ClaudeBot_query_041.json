    "strengths": [
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and practical: 'Are you somewhere you can buy something nearby, or are you stuck with whatever's in the building?' - shows genuine interest in helping",
      "Good practical advice with specific options (yogurt + banana, sandwich, burrito, soup + bread) that are realistic for teens",
      "Validates that the emotional response is normal: 'so the emotion spike is pretty normal' and acknowledges the self-annoyance aspect"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes it feel too formal and clinical compared to Claude's warm 😅 opener",
      "Heavy use of parenthetical lists creates a bullet-point feel even within prose: '(snack drawer, break room, vending machine, a coworker's spare), grabbing something cheap and filling (yogurt + banana, a sandwich, a burrito, soup + bread)' - this is the opposite of Claude's natural flow",
      "Opens with analytical language ('annoyingly specific kind of disappointment') rather than immediate empathetic validation like Claude's 'Ugh, that's such a bummer!'",
      "The tone is more therapeutic/coaching ('take ten seconds and name the problem plainly') rather than casual friend-texting like Claude's 'The struggle is real'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is excellent - specific, practical, and shows genuine engagement with the teen's situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the heavy use of parenthetical lists/options creates a clinical, structured feel that's the opposite of Claude's warm, flowing conversational style",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While technically no bullet points, the response uses extensive parenthetical lists that create a similar structured, option-heavy feel: '(snack drawer, break room, vending machine, a coworker's spare)' and '(yogurt + banana, a sandwich, a burrito, soup + bread)'. This breaks up the natural prose flow that Claude maintains."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude opens with immediate, casual empathy ('Ugh, that's such a bummer!') while the evaluated response opens with analytical framing ('annoyingly specific kind of disappointment')",
      "Claude uses an emoji early (😅) to set a warm tone; evaluated response has zero emojis, making it feel more formal",
      "Claude's advice flows naturally in conversational sentences ('Do you have any backup options nearby?') while the evaluated response lists options in parentheses, creating a more structured, less conversational feel",
      "Claude's tone is consistently casual and friend-like ('The struggle is real', 'live dangerously') while the evaluated response has coaching/therapeutic language ('take ten seconds and name the problem plainly', 'treat it like you'd treat a friend')",
      "Claude keeps it lighter and more playful ('the universe just decides we need to live dangerously') while the evaluated response is more serious and instructional throughout"
