    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is excellent and specific - the script example ('Hey, I need to tell you something...') is concrete and immediately actionable, better than ground truth",
      "Follow-up question is natural and specific to the situation, asking about parents' typical reactions and whether it's one-time or ongoing"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with headers (###) and bold text throughout - completely opposite of Claude's prose style. Ground truth uses minimal formatting, this uses extensive markdown",
      "Missing emotional warmth at the start - opens with 'That's a really tough spot' but immediately pivots to logistics. Ground truth opens with 'Oh man, I totally get why you're feeling anxious' which is much warmer",
      "Zero emojis - makes it feel formal and cold compared to Claude's natural emoji use",
      "The safety section about 'yelling, insults, or punishment that feels scary' introduces a darker tone that wasn't in the original query and feels somewhat heavy-handed"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end are natural and conversational, showing genuine interest in understanding the teen's specific situation to provide better guidance",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of headers, bold text, and bullet points throughout - this reads like a structured guide or article rather than a warm conversation. Ground truth uses minimal formatting and flows as prose",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured sections with headers (###), bold text (**), and extensive bullet points. Only the opening sentence, script example, and closing question are in prose form. Ground truth uses 3 simple headers with minimal bullets, maintaining conversational flow. This response feels like a formatted article."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Formatting: Ground truth uses minimal structure (3 simple headers, few bullets) while evaluated response is heavily formatted with markdown headers, bold text throughout, and extensive bullet lists",
      "Emotional tone: Ground truth opens with strong validation ('Oh man, I totally get why you're feeling anxious') and maintains warmth throughout. Evaluated response is more clinical and jumps quickly to logistics",
      "No emojis: Ground truth doesn't use emojis either, but combined with the heavy formatting and less warm tone, the evaluated response feels significantly more formal",
      "Safety concerns: Evaluated response introduces concerns about harsh reactions, yelling, and feeling unsafe that weren't implied in the query, potentially adding anxiety rather than reassurance",
      "Closing: Ground truth ends with encouragement ('You've got this!') before the question. Evaluated response ends only with the question, missing that final supportive note"
