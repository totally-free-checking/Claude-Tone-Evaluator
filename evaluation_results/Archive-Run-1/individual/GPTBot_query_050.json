      "Practical advice is excellent - very specific and actionable with concrete phrases like 'What part do you want?' and 'Let's split it 50/50'",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with 5 numbered sections, headers, and extensive bullet points - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth has minimal bullets; this response is 80%+ structured lists",
      "Jumps almost immediately to solutions after one sentence of validation ('Oof, that's a rough situation') - Claude spends much more time on emotional validation first",
      "Only one emoji in the entire response, and it's not used naturally in the flow - Claude uses 1-2 emojis but places them more organically",
      "Length is excessive (5 major sections) compared to Claude's 2-4 paragraph approach, making it feel like a comprehensive guide rather than a supportive conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end ('What exactly have they done/said...', 'Is this a one-day assignment...') are specific, conversational, and show genuine interest in continuing the dialogue",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of numbered sections, headers (### 1), 2), etc.), and bullet points throughout - this reads like a structured advice article rather than a warm, conversational response. Claude's ground truth uses prose paragraphs with only 3 simple bullets embedded naturally",

      "notes": "Response is dominated by 5 numbered sections with headers, each containing multiple bullet points. Ground truth has 3 simple bullets embedded in prose (20% bullets vs 80% prose). This response inverts that ratio completely."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is conversational prose with minimal bullets; evaluated response is heavily formatted with 5 numbered sections and headers",
      "Emotional validation: Ground truth opens with empathy and asks about the situation before giving advice; evaluated response gives one line of validation then immediately launches into solutions",
      "Tone: Ground truth feels like texting a supportive friend; evaluated response reads like a comprehensive how-to guide or article",
      "Length and focus: Ground truth is concise (2-3 short paragraphs); evaluated response is extensive with 5 detailed sections covering every possible scenario"
