    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'That's such a tricky situation to be in!' - acknowledges the emotional complexity right away",
      "Excellent conversational tone throughout with natural phrases like 'you know?' and 'I totally get the dilemma'",
      "Multiple thoughtful follow-up questions that show genuine interest and help the teen explore their concerns ('Is it based on specific things they've done, or more of a gut feeling?')",
      "Pure prose format with natural paragraph flow - zero bullet points or over-formatting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing an emoji that would typically appear in Claude's responses - usually 1-2 emojis help set the warm, casual tone early on",
      "Could potentially offer one small piece of practical framing advice before the questions, though the exploratory approach is also valid for this type of query"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The conversational flow and validation-first approach is perfectly Claude - 'It's tough when you care about someone but have concerns about their partner' immediately validates the teen's protective instinct while acknowledging the complexity",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any emojis is the only notable divergence - Claude typically uses 1-2 emojis (like 😅 or 😊) to enhance the warm, casual tone",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting - three natural paragraphs that flow conversationally without any lists, bullets, or over-structuring. Reads exactly like a supportive text conversation."
