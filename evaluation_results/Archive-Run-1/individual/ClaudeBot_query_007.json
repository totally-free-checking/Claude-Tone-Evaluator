    "strengths": [
      "Excellent practical advice - very specific and actionable (e.g., 'send one clear message right now', specific template for contacting partner, 'minimum viable project' concept)",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and helpful ('If you tell me what kind of project it is... I can help you choose the fastest minimum viable structure')",
      "Good documentation strategy with concrete examples (screenshots, draft history, timestamped log)",
      "Realistic and empowering tone that treats the teen as capable ('protect your grade, finish something coherent')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points and bold headers extensively ('**Immediate damage control:**' style formatting) - this is a major deviation from Claude's prose-heavy approach",
      "Missing emojis entirely - Claude uses 😬 early to set warm tone, evaluated response has zero emojis making it feel more formal/cold",
      "Jumps into advice mode too quickly - opening validation ('That's a horrible spot to be in') is brief compared to Claude's 'Oof, that's super stressful! 😬 I feel for you - we've all been there'",
      "Significantly longer and denser than Claude's response - feels more like a comprehensive guide than a supportive conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is perfectly Claude-like - specific, helpful, and naturally invites continued conversation: 'If you tell me what kind of project it is... I can help you choose the fastest minimum viable structure and even draft a message'",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bullet points and bold formatting ('**Immediate damage control:**', '**If they're MIA:**') - Claude's ground truth uses prose paragraphs with advice flowing naturally in sentences, not structured lists",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "While the response is primarily prose, it uses bold headers to structure sections which creates a more formal, guide-like feel rather than Claude's conversational flow. The ground truth also has bullets but integrates them more naturally within a conversational framework."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Formatting: Ground truth uses bold headers with bullets underneath in a clear structure; evaluated response uses longer prose paragraphs but still feels more like a comprehensive guide than a conversation",
      "Emotional tone: Ground truth opens with 'Oof, that's super stressful! 😬 I feel for you - we've all been there' (warm, relatable, emoji); evaluated response opens with 'That's a horrible spot to be in' (validates but less warm, no emoji)",
      "Length and density: Evaluated response is significantly longer and more detailed, feeling more like a thorough tutorial than a supportive chat",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth uses 😬 to set warm tone; evaluated response has zero emojis making it feel more formal"
