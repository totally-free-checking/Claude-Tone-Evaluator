    "strengths": [
      "Strong prose formatting - maintains paragraph structure throughout without bullet points, which aligns well with Claude's style",
      "Practical advice is specific and nuanced ('calm, consistent neutrality', 'treat them like a coworker') rather than generic platitudes",
      "Ends with an engaging, specific follow-up question that invites more detail about the actual situation",
      "Acknowledges complexity well ('A couple things can be true at once') which shows sophisticated understanding"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks emojis - makes it feel more formal and less warm than Claude's approach (Ground truth opens with 'Ugh' and uses natural casual markers)",
      "Opening validation is weaker - 'That's a really uncomfortable spot' is more clinical than Claude's 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable situation!' The emotional resonance is lower",
      "Tone is significantly more analytical and advice-heavy than supportive. Phrases like 'low-effort approach', 'effective lever', and 'strategy that fits' sound more like a consultant than a supportive friend",
      "Too long and dense - five substantial paragraphs with complex sentence structures make it harder to read on a phone compared to Claude's more digestible 2-3 paragraph structure",
      "Language is more formal and academic ('situational', 'escalates', 'cordial', 'lever') rather than casual teen-appropriate language"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose-based formatting and avoidance of bullet points perfectly matches Claude's conversational paragraph style",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the analytical, consultant-like tone ('effective lever', 'low-effort approach') - Claude would never sound this clinical when supporting a teen",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent adherence to prose format. No bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. However, the prose itself is dense and academic rather than conversational."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Emotional tone: Ground truth opens with 'Ugh!' and maintains warmth throughout. Evaluated response is more detached and analytical",
      "No emojis vs. natural emoji use in ground truth style",
      "Language register: Ground truth uses casual phrases ('warming up to you', 'what's up') while evaluated response uses formal language ('situational', 'cordial', 'lever')",
      "Length: Ground truth is concise (3 short paragraphs) vs. evaluated response is dense (5 longer paragraphs)",
      "Advice delivery: Ground truth embeds advice naturally in conversation with bullet points only for quick tips. Evaluated response reads more like strategic coaching",
      "Balance: Ground truth leads with validation and keeps it light. Evaluated response jumps quickly into analysis and strategy"
