      "Strong follow-up question at the end that's specific and engaging: 'who is comparing you (parent, relatives, sibling, friends), and what do they say?' - this shows genuine interest and offers to help further",
      "Good practical advice with specific phrases the teen could actually use in conversations, like 'When you compare me to [sibling], I feel discouraged and like my efforts don't count'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure with 4 main bullet points and bold headers ('**Name what's happening + how it lands:**') - completely opposite of Claude's prose-based approach. The ground truth has zero bullets and flows naturally in paragraphs",
      "Jumps almost immediately to solutions after only one sentence of validation. Claude's response spends the entire first two paragraphs on emotional validation before even hinting at next steps",
      "Only one emoji at the very beginning (—), while Claude uses 'honestly' and natural language to create warmth instead of relying on formatting",
      "The tone is more instructional/coaching ('A few things that can help') rather than conversational and empathetic. Phrases like 'Name what's happening + how it lands' sound like therapy-speak rather than friend-speak"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question is genuinely engaging and specific, offering to help craft a response - this matches Claude's approach of continuing the conversation and showing investment in the teen's situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy bullet-point structure with bold headers and formatted lists. This reads like a self-help article or coaching guide rather than a supportive conversation. Claude's response is pure prose with natural flow",

      "notes": "Response is approximately 75% bullet-pointed advice with bold headers and structured formatting. Only the opening sentence and closing question are in natural prose. This is the complete opposite of Claude's approach, which uses 100% prose with natural conversational flow"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth is 3 natural paragraphs of prose; evaluated response is 1 sentence + 4 bullet points + closing question",
      "Validation timing: Ground truth spends 2 full paragraphs validating feelings before any advice; evaluated response gives 1 sentence of validation then immediately pivots to 'A few things that can help'",
      "Tone: Ground truth is conversational ('Ugh, that's really frustrating!', 'you know?', 'it still feels crappy'); evaluated response is more instructional ('Name what's happening', 'Set a boundary')",
      "Emoji usage: Ground truth has no emojis but maintains warmth through language; evaluated response has one dash-emoji but relies on formatting/structure instead of conversational warmth",
      "Advice delivery: Ground truth hints at support ('Want to vent about what happened?') without prescribing solutions; evaluated response immediately provides a structured action plan"
