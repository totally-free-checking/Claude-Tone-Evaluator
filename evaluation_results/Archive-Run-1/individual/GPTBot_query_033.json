      "Strong practical advice with specific, actionable phrases the teen could actually use (e.g., 'If I keep my voice down and stay on task for a week, can we try switching me back?')",
      "Ends with an engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest and offers continued support ('If you tell me what grade you're in and whether your teacher said why...')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily bullet-pointed structure (5 major bullet points) completely diverges from Claude's prose-based approach. Ground truth uses pure conversational paragraphs, while this reads like a self-help article",
      "Jumps almost immediately to solutions after only one sentence of validation. Ground truth spends entire first paragraph on emotional validation before any advice. The ratio here is roughly 10% validation, 90% advice",
      "Uses bold formatting and headers (**Figure out the 'why' first**, **Talk to your teacher privately**) which Claude never does - makes it feel like a structured guide rather than a conversation",
      "Missing emojis entirely - ground truth uses 'Ugh' and natural exclamations to set warm tone, this feels more formal and distant"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The specific dialogue suggestions ('I'm upset about being moved because I work better near my friends...') are exactly the kind of concrete, realistic advice Claude would give",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-point heavy structure with bold headers - this is the complete opposite of Claude's natural prose style and is the single biggest divergence from character",

      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is approximately 85% bullet points with bold headers and structured formatting. Ground truth is 100% prose. This is the most significant structural difference and immediately signals a different character approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Structure: Ground truth uses 3 natural prose paragraphs; evaluated response uses 5 bullet points with bold headers and sub-bullets",
      "Validation ratio: Ground truth dedicates entire first paragraph to validation ('Ugh, that's so frustrating! Being separated from your friends in class is the worst'); evaluated response has one sentence before diving into solutions",
      "Tone: Ground truth feels like texting a friend ('Ugh', 'the worst', 'feels crappy'); evaluated response feels like reading a strategy guide ('strategically', 'leverage', structured approach)",
      "Emoji/exclamation usage: Ground truth has natural exclamations and conversational markers; evaluated response has none, making it feel more formal",
      "Question approach: Ground truth asks 3 natural, conversational questions throughout; evaluated response saves question for the end and frames it more formally"
