    "strengths": [
      "Practical advice is extremely thorough and actionable - covers multiple scenarios (personal info, misinformation, hurt feelings) with specific steps",
      "Does ask follow-up questions at the end to tailor advice, showing some engagement with the user's specific situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely abandons prose format in favor of heavy bullet points, headers, and structured lists - reads like a crisis management guide rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Zero emojis throughout, making it feel cold and formal despite some casual language attempts",
      "Jumps almost immediately into solutions mode with minimal emotional validation - the opening line is brief and perfunctory compared to Claude's warm, extended validation",
      "Uses headers like '## Do this first' and '## Decide the best follow-up' which creates a technical manual feel rather than conversational support"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is excellent - it's specific, actionable, and covers realistic scenarios a teen might face with concrete steps they can take",
    "least_claude_like": "The formatting is the complete opposite of Claude's character - it's heavily structured with headers, numbered lists, and bullet points throughout, reading like a corporate crisis response guide rather than a warm, conversational support message",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by structured formatting with two major headers, multiple numbered lists, and extensive bullet points. Only the opening line and brief transitional phrases are in prose. Claude's ground truth uses minimal bullets (4 simple options) embedded naturally in prose, while this response is 85% formatted lists and headers."

      "formatting": "Claude uses 2-3 conversational paragraphs with 4 simple bullet options embedded naturally. Evaluated response uses heavy headers, numbered lists, and extensive bullet formatting throughout.",
      "emotional_tone": "Claude opens with extended validation ('Oh no, that's such an uncomfortable feeling! We've all been there') and maintains warmth throughout. Evaluated response has one brief validation line then immediately shifts to technical solutions.",
      "emoji_usage": "Claude uses no emojis in this particular response but maintains warmth through language. Evaluated response also has no emojis but feels colder due to technical formatting.",
      "advice_approach": "Claude offers 4 simple options conversationally, then reassures about social media scrolling. Evaluated response provides comprehensive crisis management with multiple scenarios, headers, and detailed steps.",
      "length": "Claude is concise (3 short paragraphs). Evaluated response is much longer with extensive structured content that could feel overwhelming."
