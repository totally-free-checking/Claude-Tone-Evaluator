    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting - pure paragraph form with natural flow, no bullets or lists. This matches Claude's style perfectly: 'it's not that your friends don't like you—it's that the \"being included\" part isn't just proximity'",
      "Very strong practical advice with specific, actionable suggestions: 'Pick one friend you trust most and engage them directly for a bit—ask a real question, comment on what they said, or suggest something specific you can do together.' This is concrete and realistic for teens.",
      "Good follow-up question that's specific to the situation: 'When this feeling happens, is it mostly in big group situations, or even one-on-one too?' Shows genuine interest in understanding their experience better."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing emojis - Claude's response uses natural warmth markers, but this response feels more clinical without any emoji support. Claude would likely include a 😔 or similar in the opening.",
      "Too long and dense for a teen audience - four substantial paragraphs with complex sentence structures. Claude's response is more digestible at 3 shorter paragraphs. This reads more like a therapy article than a supportive text.",
      "Jumps too quickly into analysis mode without enough emotional sitting-with-them time. Claude validates first ('That sounds really tough'), then explores, then advises. This response moves to explanation ('A few common patterns') in paragraph 2, which feels premature.",
      "Language is more formal and academic: 'unspoken rhythm', 'monitoring yourself', 'low-drama way'. Claude uses simpler, more conversational language: 'not quite connecting on the same wavelength', 'watching everyone else have fun from behind glass'."
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The pure prose formatting and natural flow of advice within paragraphs - no bullets, no headers, just conversational paragraphs that build on each other naturally",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of emojis and the overly analytical, therapy-speak tone that makes it feel more like professional advice than a supportive friend",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences and paragraphs. This is exactly Claude's approach to structure."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Length and density: Ground truth is 3 concise paragraphs (readable on phone), evaluated response is 4 dense paragraphs with complex psychological concepts",
      "Emotional pacing: Ground truth validates, then gently explores with questions, then offers one simple suggestion. Evaluated response explains patterns, then gives multiple strategies, which feels more instructional",
      "Language complexity: Ground truth uses simple, relatable phrases ('behind glass', 'same wavelength'). Evaluated response uses more formal language ('unspoken rhythm', 'redirect to curiosity', 'low-drama way')",
      "No emojis: Ground truth doesn't show emojis in this example, but Claude's character typically includes 1-2. Evaluated response has none and feels colder as a result",
      "Advice timing: Ground truth asks exploratory questions first ('Do you feel like you can be yourself?'), then suggests focusing on quality connections. Evaluated response jumps into explaining patterns and multiple strategies earlier"
