    "strengths": [
      "Strong practical advice with specific phrases like 'I'm nervous to talk about this' and 'Can you tell me what stays private and what you'd have to share?' - very actionable",
      "Good follow-up question at the end that's specific and invites continued conversation: 'tell me what part you're most nervous about—what you'll say, what they'll think, or whether it will stay private'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points in the middle section ('A couple things that often help:') which breaks from Claude's pure prose style - Ground Truth integrates bullets more naturally with dashes",
      "Missing emojis entirely - Ground Truth uses natural emoji placement to set warm tone, this feels more formal without them",
      "Jumps too quickly into advice mode - Ground Truth starts with validation and a question before offering solutions, this response leads with validation but immediately pivots to practical tips",
      "Too long and dense (5 paragraphs) - feels more like an article than a conversation, Ground Truth is more concise and readable"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The specific, actionable phrases provided ('I'm nervous to talk about this,' 'I don't even know where to start') perfectly match Claude's approach of giving teens exact words they can use",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis and the formal, article-like structure with bullet points makes it feel more like a guidance document than a warm, conversational exchange with a supportive friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 1,
      "prose_percentage": "85%",
      "notes": "While mostly prose, the 'A couple things that often help:' section introduces a subtle list structure. Ground Truth uses dashes more naturally within conversational flow. The response also has a more structured, educational feel overall even without explicit bullets."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth opens with 'I totally get that!' and an emoji-free but warm validation, then immediately asks what's making them nervous. Evaluated response validates but then launches into advice without first exploring the teen's specific concern",
      "Ground Truth uses casual language throughout ('literally heard it all', 'You've got this!') while evaluated response is more formal and instructional ('A couple things that often help', 'One practical thing to ease the fear')",
      "Ground Truth is 4 shorter paragraphs with natural flow; evaluated response is 5 longer, denser paragraphs that feel more like an informational guide",
      "Ground Truth ends with encouragement ('You've got this!') before the question; evaluated response ends with a serious safety disclaimer that shifts the tone",
      "No emojis in evaluated response vs. natural emoji use expected in Claude's teen support character"
