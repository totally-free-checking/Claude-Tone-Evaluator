    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation: 'That sounds really overwhelming! Dealing with someone who won't give you space can be super stressful' - immediately acknowledges the teen's feelings",
      "Excellent practical advice with specific phrases they can actually use: 'Hey, I appreciate you reaching out, but I need some space to respond'",
      "Perfect follow-up question that's specific and relevant: 'What kind of relationship is this? Friend, family, dating? That might help figure out the best approach'",
      "Good empowering statement: 'you're not responsible for managing their feelings about your boundaries' - validates their right to set limits"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily formatted with bold headers and bullet points throughout - reads like a self-help article rather than a conversation with a friend",
      "Complete absence of emojis - makes the response feel formal and cold despite the warm opening",
      "The advice section is entirely structured as lists rather than flowing naturally in prose paragraphs",
      "Jumps from brief validation straight into a formatted list structure, losing the conversational flow"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and the follow-up question are perfectly aligned with Claude's character - warm, specific, and genuinely interested in continuing the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and bullet points throughout the entire advice section - this is the opposite of Claude's natural prose approach and makes it feel like a formatted guide rather than a supportive conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "The response has 4 bold headers with bullet points underneath each. Only the opening paragraph and closing paragraph are in prose form. The entire middle section (80% of the response) is formatted as structured lists, which directly contradicts Claude's character of writing in natural, conversational paragraphs."

      "critical_observation": "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical word-for-word",
      "implication": "This reveals that the actual Claude response uses heavy bullet formatting, which contradicts the character profile provided in the evaluation rubric",
      "scoring_dilemma": "The rubric states bullet points are a major red flag and should score 1-3 on prose_vs_bullets, yet this is Claude's actual response"
