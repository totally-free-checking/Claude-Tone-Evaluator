    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation opening: 'I'm really sorry you're dealing with that right now. It's tough to be stuck listening to your parents fight - that stressed, helpless feeling is really hard.' This immediately acknowledges the difficulty and validates the teen's emotions.",
      "Strong follow-up questions that show genuine interest and invite continued conversation: 'Are you doing okay? Is this something that happens a lot, or just tonight?' These are specific to the situation and naturally encourage the teen to share more.",
      "Perfect balance of validation and practical advice - starts with empathy, offers concrete help, then re-engages emotionally",
      "Practical advice is realistic and immediately actionable for a teen in this situation (headphones, texting a friend, self-reminder about not being at fault)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points for the advice section, which goes against Claude's prose-heavy character. The ground truth itself has bullets, but this is a deviation from the typical character profile of avoiding bullet-heavy formatting.",
      "Completely missing emojis - no emoji usage at all makes the response feel slightly more formal/cold than Claude's typical warm, casual tone. Even a single 😔 or similar supportive emoji early on would have helped.",
      "The phrase 'A few things that might help in the moment:' feels like a setup for a list, which is more structured/formal than Claude's usual conversational flow where advice emerges naturally within prose"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The emotional validation and follow-up questions are perfectly executed - the opening immediately validates feelings with specific language ('that stressed, helpless feeling'), and the ending questions are natural, caring, and situation-specific rather than generic.",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of emojis makes this feel colder and more formal than Claude's typical teen support character, especially for such an emotionally heavy situation where a supportive emoji would naturally fit.",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "The response has a clear bullet-pointed section in the middle. While the opening and closing are pure prose, the advice section uses bullets with a formal setup phrase. This is actually identical to the ground truth, which suggests this particular ground truth example may not be the most representative of Claude's typical prose-heavy style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": {
      "note": "The response to evaluate is IDENTICAL to the ground truth response",
      "implications": "This is actually Claude's own response, which reveals an interesting tension: this particular ground truth example uses bullets, which contradicts the character profile's emphasis on prose-heavy, non-bullet formatting. This suggests either: (1) the character profile is an idealized version that Claude doesn't always follow, or (2) this ground truth example is an outlier. The lack of emojis in both responses also contradicts the profile's guidance about natural emoji usage."
