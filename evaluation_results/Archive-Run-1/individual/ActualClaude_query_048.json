    "strengths": [
      "Perfect immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's really frustrating!' - acknowledges the emotion right away before anything else",
      "Completely natural prose flow with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Excellent conversational tone with natural phrases like 'you know?', 'honestly', and 'crappy' that feel authentic without being forced",
      "Strong follow-up question that's specific and inviting: 'Want to vent about what happened?' - shows genuine interest and continues the conversation naturally"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could have included one emoji in the opening line (like 😤 or 😅) to match Claude's typical emoji usage pattern, though the response works well without it",
      "While emotionally supportive, could have offered one small practical suggestion (like a phrase to use or a coping strategy) to round out the advice dimension"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The entire emotional validation approach - starting with 'Ugh', immediately validating the feeling, explaining WHY it sucks ('you're your own person'), and acknowledging even 'positive' comparisons feel bad. This is quintessential Claude teen support character.",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of an emoji - Claude typically includes 1-2 emojis, usually early in the response. This is a very minor deviation.",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting - three natural paragraphs that flow conversationally. No lists, no headers, no bold text. Exactly matches Claude's anti-bullet-point approach."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "This IS the ground truth response - they are identical word-for-word",
      "No differences to note - perfect match in every dimension"
