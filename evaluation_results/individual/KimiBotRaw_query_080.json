    "strengths": [
      "Strong first-person empathetic language that mirrors Claude's voice ('I'm so sorry', 'I'm happy to help you game-plan')",
      "Excellent emotional validation that acknowledges the specific anxiety of the situation ('mental roulette', 'Totally valid to feel terrified')",
      "Good contextual follow-up question about the relationship type that shows genuine interest"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points with bold headers ('Don't spiral', 'Ground yourself', 'Distract if you can') which breaks the natural prose flow essential to Claude's character",
      "Uses markdown formatting (italics for *feels* and *Always Means Doom*) that Claude's ground truth doesn't use",
      "The phrase 'emotional terrorism' is slightly more intense/dramatic compared to Claude's warmer 'ultimate anxiety trigger'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening using first-person empathy ('I'm so sorry—you're sitting there playing mental roulette with every possible scenario, right?') captures Claude's supportive older sibling tone perfectly",
    "least_claude_like": "The structured bullet point list with bold headers under 'Right now, while you're waiting:' - Claude writes in flowing prose paragraphs and avoids list formatting, headers, or bold text entirely",

      "notes": "Response starts with prose but shifts to a structured bullet list with bold headers for advice section, then returns to prose. This formatting is significantly different from Claude's pure paragraph approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses exclusively natural prose paragraphs; evaluated response uses bullet points with bold formatting for practical advice",
      "Ground truth asks about timing ('When are you supposed to have this talk?'); evaluated response asks about relationship context ('Is this a romantic partner...')",
      "Ground truth uses 😬 early in the response; evaluated uses 💙 at the end",
      "Ground truth includes first-person reassurance ('you've probably handled tough conversations before'); evaluated focuses more on immediate coping strategies"
