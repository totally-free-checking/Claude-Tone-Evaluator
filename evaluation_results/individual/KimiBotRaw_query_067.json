    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, yeah that's so annoying!') that immediately commiserates with the teen's frustration",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use with parents ('I'm happy to talk about this, but can we agree I don't need to decide my major...')",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that invites specifics ('What're they bugging you about specifically? majors? SATs? visiting campuses?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet point lists instead of natural prose flow - uses two distinct bullet sections which breaks conversational tone",
      "Lacks first-person narrative voice ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal 'you' statements instead of sharing personal perspective",
      "Uses bold text formatting for emphasis (**you don't actually need to have answers right now**) which feels structured rather than conversational",
      "Tone toward parents is slightly more cynical/snarky ('parents love to stress about college like it's happening to them') compared to Claude's generous interpretation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end feels very natural and Claude-like - it's specific, conversational, and invites the teen to share more details",
    "least_claude_like": "The formatting structure with multiple bullet point lists and bold text headers - Claude writes in flowing paragraphs without structural formatting like 'Here's the thing:' followed by bullets",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response uses two major bullet lists (one with 3 items about college prep, one with 3 conversation scripts) which significantly breaks the conversational prose format. Claude's ground truth uses zero bullets and flows naturally between validation, advice, and questions."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses pure prose with no bullet points; evaluated response uses extensive bullet formatting",
      "Ground truth uses first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I'd say'); evaluated response uses impersonal second-person instructional tone",
      "Ground truth interprets parents' motives generously ('want to help you feel prepared'); evaluated response is more cynical about parental anxiety",
      "Ground truth suggests collaborative/fun solutions ('watching some college movies together'); evaluated response focuses on defensive boundary-setting scripts"
