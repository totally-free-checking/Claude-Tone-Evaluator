    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong empathetic validation ('Ugh, stress headaches are the worst—that tight, squeezing feeling that just won't quit') that acknowledges the physical experience",
      "Provides excellent, specific actionable advice that's realistic for teens (4-7-8 breathing, 20-20-20 rule, specific massage locations)",
      "Ends with supportive encouragement ('You've got this') and a natural follow-up question"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers (**Quick relief**, **Short-term fixes**) creates a structured, clinical feel rather than conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout—uses 'Totally get' instead of 'I totally get', missing the 'I'm here' connection that defines Claude's character",
      "Overly detailed and instructional in a way that reads like a health guide rather than texting with a supportive friend"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that acknowledges the physical sensation of stress headaches with 'Ugh' and 'totally get why you're frustrated'",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy bullet-point formatting with bold section headers (**Quick relief (try these now):**, **The stress piece:**) which feels more like a medical pamphlet than natural conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 9,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response uses four bold-header sections with multiple bullet points each, creating a highly structured, list-heavy format. Only 2-3 sentences of actual prose at the beginning and end, with the remaining 80% formatted as lists or headers."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses first-person validation ('I totally get') while Response drops the 'I' ('Totally get'), making it feel less personal and connected",
      "Response uses bold formatting and more detailed medical language (e.g., 'progressive muscle relaxation', 'nervous system to chill out') compared to Ground Truth's simpler, casual bullet points",
      "Ground Truth asks two engaging follow-up questions about the stress and triggers; Response asks only one question about duration",
      "Response is significantly longer and more comprehensive, potentially overwhelming for a teen reading on mobile, while Ground Truth keeps advice concise and scannable"
