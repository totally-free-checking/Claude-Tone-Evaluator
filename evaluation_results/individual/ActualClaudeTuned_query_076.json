      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Oh, I totally get that feeling!') that mirrors the ground truth's empathetic approach",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I think maybe the pressure...', 'You're allowed to be interested...') creating authentic conversational tone",
      "Maintains pure prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks concrete examples when describing others' 'things' (ground truth mentions 'guitar' and 'rock climbing' specifically; evaluated response stays general)",
      "Advice section is slightly more abstract than ground truth - focuses on 'being curious about everything' rather than offering specific alternative identities like 'being a great listener'"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth provides specific hobby examples (guitar, rock climbing, career path) to illustrate the 'thing' concept while evaluated response speaks generally about others having their identity figured out",
      "Ground truth suggests concrete alternative qualities (great listener, sense of humor) while evaluated response focuses more on the philosophical reframe of being multifaceted or curious",
      "Ground truth explicitly mentions 'exploration phase' as a valid state; evaluated response emphasizes 'figuring out what clicks' and paying attention to small engagements"
