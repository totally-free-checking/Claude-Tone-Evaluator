    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I get why this feels frustrating') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Natural prose formatting without any bullet points, allowing advice to flow conversationally",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can use ('hey, could you take down that pic of me?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing emotional check-in in the follow-up question (doesn't ask 'how are you feeling?' like the Ground Truth)",
      "Omits some practical protective steps mentioned in Ground Truth, such as screenshotting evidence or mentioning legal rights",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses bullet points for organization while Response uses pure prose paragraphs",
      "Response incorporates more first-person perspective ('I think', 'I get') vs Ground Truth's more impersonal 'Here are some steps' approach",
      "Ground Truth asks about feelings explicitly ('How are you feeling about it?') while Response jumps to asking about the relationship",
      "Response provides specific conversational script for the teen to use, while Ground Truth gives more general action items"
