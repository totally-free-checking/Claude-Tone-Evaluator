      "Excellent emotional validation with specific acknowledgment of the 'auditioning' feeling and being a 'contingency plan'",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I'm sorry','I'm rooting for you') and casual phrasing ('u up?','dopamine hit')",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice for teens like saying 'I'm busy' to late-night texts and pulling back to see who notices"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers (**It's usually not about your worth**, etc.) that create a structured, list-like format instead of pure conversational prose",
      "The three bold sections make it read more like a self-help article than a natural text conversation between friends"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The conversational tone and first-person validation style - it genuinely sounds like a supportive friend acknowledging the specific pain of being a 'backup' with empathy and warmth",
    "least_claude_like": "The formatting with bold headers/sections - Claude's responses flow as natural paragraphs without structural markers or bold text breaking up the advice",

      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "While the content under each section is prose, the three bold headers (**It's usually not about your worth**, **You can quietly stop auditioning**, **Backup dynamics often happen in transitions**) function as bullet points, breaking the natural flow and creating a structured list format unlike Claude's pure paragraph style"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses pure prose paragraphs with no formatting; evaluated response uses bold headers that segment advice into structured sections",
      "Ground truth places the follow-up question in the middle of the response; evaluated response places it at the end (both acceptable but different)",
      "Ground truth uses no emojis; evaluated response uses one yellow heart at the end (minor difference)"
