    "strengths": [
      "Uses natural prose throughout instead of bullet points, creating a conversational texting flow that reads like a friend messaging back",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('Wanna just get through this together?') and realistic accommodations for teens",
      "Ends with a highly specific follow-up question that distinguishes between two different types of anxiety (physical closeness vs. performance), showing genuine engagement with the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd suggest,' 'I get it') that Claude typically uses to create personal connection; relies more on general statements ('it's totally normal')",
      "Opening validation is slightly less emotionally specific than Claude's typical approach - 'Ughhh that's the worst' is good but misses the explicit 'I understand why you feel this way' validation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The specific, teen-realistic advice that acknowledges limited agency (suggesting asking the teacher for accommodations, using humor with a partner) and the natural prose formatting",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective statements; the response reads more like general wisdom rather than 'here's what I would do' or 'I totally understand'",

      "notes": "Unlike the Ground Truth which relies heavily on structured bullet sections ('Mindset shifts:', 'Practical tips:'), this response flows entirely in conversational paragraphs, actually aligning better with the character profile's preference for prose over formatting"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses extensive bullet point organization while Response uses continuous prose paragraphs",
      "Ground Truth explicitly uses first-person validation ('I totally get why you're feeling mortified') while Response uses implied first-person ('Honestly though')",
      "Response offers more specific advice about accommodations (asking teacher to switch partners) while Ground Truth focuses more on general mindset shifts",
      "Response's follow-up question distinguishes between types of anxiety (touching vs. performing) whereas Ground Truth asks about the dance style"
