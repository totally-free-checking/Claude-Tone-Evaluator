      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'That feeling of violation is so real' and 'I get why you feel so angry and hurt'",
      "Provides specific, actionable dialogue script ('I understand you care about me, but reading my diary made me feel really violated...') that gives the teen exact words to use",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a blue heart emoji (💙) when the user didn't request emojis; ground truth used zero",
