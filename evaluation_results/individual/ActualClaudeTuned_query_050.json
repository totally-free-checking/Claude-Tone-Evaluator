      "Excellent use of natural prose without any bullet points, creating a conversational flow that feels like texting",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I think', 'honestly') that creates personal connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's so rough!') that acknowledges the awkwardness before moving to solutions"

      "Only asks one follow-up question at the end versus Claude's pattern of asking multiple engaging questions throughout",
      "Uses a blue heart emoji (💙) which feels slightly less natural than the ground truth's awkward face (😬) for this specific situation",
