    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong immediate validation ('Ugh, that's the worst') that acknowledges the emotional weight and awkwardness of the situation",
      "Integrates advice seamlessly into natural prose paragraphs without resorting to bullet points or lists, making it feel like a genuine conversation rather than a self-help article",
      "Provides exceptionally specific, actionable scripts that teens can actually use word-for-word (e.g., 'do you wanna take slides 1–3 and I'll do 4–6?' and the specific teacher conversation script)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I'm here if you need to talk' that Claude typically uses to establish personal connection",
      "Places the follow-up question only at the end rather than engaging early with a question like the ground truth does, which slightly reduces the conversational back-and-forth feel",
      "Could include slightly more emotional validation at the close (like acknowledging stress or offering support) rather than jumping straight to the behavioral question"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The pure prose formatting with zero bullet points and naturally flowing advice paragraphs that read like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of explicit first-person perspective statements ('I think,' 'I'd say') makes it feel slightly more impersonal than Claude's typical 'I'm here with you' approach",

      "notes": "Response uses zero bullet points or lists, integrating all advice into conversational paragraphs. This actually exceeds the ground truth (which used 3 bullet points) in matching the 'natural prose' ideal."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for advice while evaluated response integrates everything into flowing prose paragraphs",
      "Ground truth asks an engaging question early in the response ('Can I ask...') while evaluated response saves all questions for the end",
      "Evaluated response provides more specific concrete scripts and examples (slide numbers, exact teacher phrasing) compared to the ground truth's more general suggestions"
