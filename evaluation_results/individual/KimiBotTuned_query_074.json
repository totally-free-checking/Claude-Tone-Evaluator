    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose flow with zero bullet points, maintaining conversational paragraph structure throughout",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('I’ve noticed the rules got tighter lately—did something happen?') and concrete negotiation tactics",
      "Uses first-person language naturally within suggested dialogue and maintains warm, casual tone with phrases like 'Ugh, that’s the worst' and 'parents weirdly respond better'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the ground truth uses none and the character prefers zero unless explicitly asked",
      "Front-loads more prescriptive advice than the ground truth, which spends more time validating and asking exploratory questions before offering solutions",
      "Opening 'Ugh' is slightly more casual/slangy than the ground truth's 'That sounds really frustrating' which balances warmth with slightly more composed empathy"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow that reads like texting with a supportive friend, completely avoiding bullet points or over-structuring while delivering practical advice embedded in paragraphs",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of an emoji when the user didn't request one and the ground truth demonstrates the character's preference for zero emojis in standard responses",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, perfectly matching Claude's prose-based approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis while response uses one (😅) in the opening",
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions before offering detailed advice, while response provides extensive specific tactics (negotiating one thing at a time, offering check-ins, owning up to mistakes) earlier in the conversation",
      "Ground truth suggests opening the conversation generally, while response provides more prescriptive step-by-step guidance on how to approach the negotiation"
