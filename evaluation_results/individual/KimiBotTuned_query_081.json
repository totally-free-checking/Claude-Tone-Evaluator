    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd be exhausted too', 'I've been getting', 'I'm gonna') which creates genuine connection",
      "Advice flows naturally within prose paragraphs rather than being listed out, making it feel like a real conversation",
      "Specific, realistic script provided ('Hey I've been getting your snaps super late...') that a teen could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the user didn't ask for one, while the character profile prefers 0 unless requested",
      "Slightly more casual/opening vulnerability than the Ground Truth with phrases like 'your brain finally gets to power down'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting without bullet points and the consistent use of first-person language ('I think' style statements) to create warmth and personal connection",

      "notes": "Unlike the Ground Truth which relies heavily on bullet points under headers, this response integrates all advice into flowing conversational paragraphs, perfectly matching the character profile's instruction to write in 'natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)'"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses structured bullet points and headers; Response uses pure prose with naturally embedded advice",
      "Ground Truth uses no first-person 'I' statements; Response uses first-person throughout ('I'd be exhausted', 'I've been getting')",
      "Ground Truth uses no emojis; Response uses one emoji early in the text"
