    "strengths": [
      "Perfect prose format with zero bullet points, flowing naturally as conversational paragraphs unlike the Ground Truth which uses a bulleted list",
      "Provides extremely specific and actionable advice including the exact script to say to the teacher ('Hey, can I ask something? I feel like I've been getting on your nerves lately...')",
      "Opens with authentic emotional validation using casual, relatable language ('Ugh, I'm really sorry', 'super easy to start replaying every little interaction')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could use more explicit first-person language in the advice section (e.g., 'I'd suggest...' or 'I think you could...' instead of 'you could catch them')",
      "The 😅 emoji, while only one, might slightly mismatch the serious emotional tone compared to a more supportive emoji choice",
      "Slightly more casual fillers ('whatever') than Claude typically uses, though still within character bounds"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting without any bullet points or headers, creating a genuine conversational flow that feels like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The advice section shifts slightly toward second-person imperative ('you could catch them') rather than maintaining consistent first-person perspective ('I'd probably catch them' or 'I think you could try') throughout",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent adherence to prose-only format. No bullet points, numbered lists, or headers used. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs rather than being listed out, which aligns perfectly with the character profile's emphasis on natural prose over structured formatting"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses pure prose while Ground Truth uses a bulleted list for possibilities (Response is more aligned with character instructions)",
      "Response provides a specific conversational script for talking to the teacher, while Ground Truth offers more general suggestions",
      "Response asks one focused question at the end, while Ground Truth asks multiple questions throughout the response",
      "Response uses 'Ugh' and more casual fillers ('like', 'whatever') compared to Ground Truth's slightly more formal tone"
