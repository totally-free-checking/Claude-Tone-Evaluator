    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy over-structuring with headers and sub-bullets ('**If you feel up to it:**', '**If you want to escalate:**') makes it read like a self-help article rather than a natural conversation",
      "Uses 'Here are a few things you can do' followed by categorized bullet lists, which is explicitly flagged as non-Claude-like formatting",
