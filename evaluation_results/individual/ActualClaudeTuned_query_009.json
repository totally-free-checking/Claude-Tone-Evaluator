    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd say' implied) creating authentic conversational flow",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - actually exceeds the ground truth which used bulleted lists under 'A few thoughts'",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's so awkward', 'I totally get why you'd be feeling anxious') that mirrors the ground truth's warmth"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question assumes the parents saw something specific ('What kind of stuff do you think they might have seen'), whereas the ground truth offered more open-ended options first",
      "Slightly less exploration of possible parent perspectives compared to ground truth (ground truth listed 3 specific possibilities, this jumps faster to the solution)"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose paragraph structure without any bullet points or headers - this perfectly matches the character profile's emphasis on conversational flow over formatting, even more so than the ground truth which used bullet points",
    "least_claude_like": "The single question at the end is slightly less conversational than the ground truth's paired questions that invite sharing both facts and feelings",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points under 'A few thoughts' while response maintains prose throughout",
      "Ground truth asks multiple questions in sequence while response asks one specific question",
      "Response uses 'Ugh' opener which adds casual authenticity not present in ground truth"
