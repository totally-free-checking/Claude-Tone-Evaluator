      "Strong opening validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' that immediately acknowledges the frustration",
      "Provides excellent specific scripts for the teen to use like 'Oof, that one actually hurt' and the 'turnaround test' concept",
      "Follow-up questions mirror Claude's approach by asking about duration and patterns to help assess the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers and bullet lists ('**Call it out in the moment**', '**Have the quieter conversation**') creates a structured, listicle format unlike Claude's flowing prose",
      "Lacks first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' that makes Claude's responses feel personally engaged; uses declarative 'you' statements instead",
      "Tone is slightly more confrontational ('jerk', 'being mean with a safety net') compared to Claude's gentler, exploratory approach ('super uncomfortable', 'some people genuinely don't realize')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end are nearly identical in structure and intent to Claude's approach, asking about duration and patterns to help the teen process the situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy formatting with bold section headers and multiple bullet-point lists creates a self-help article structure rather than Claude's conversational paragraph style",

      "Uses bold headers and structured bullet sections vs. Claude's natural prose flow with minimal formatting",

      "Provides categorized advice sections ('Call it out', 'Have the quieter conversation') vs. Claude's integrated narrative approach"
