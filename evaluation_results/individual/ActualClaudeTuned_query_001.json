    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd just') which creates authentic connection",
      "Opens with identical warm validation to ground truth ('Oh no! That's one of those moments...') and maintains empathetic tone",
      "Provides specific, immediately actionable advice for a teen in class ('tucking your feet under your desk', 'slip out at a natural break')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question focuses narrowly on shoe details rather than broadening to check in on their overall wellbeing like the ground truth does",
      "Slightly heavier on practical advice versus emotional validation compared to the ground truth's balance",
      "Missing the 'bold fashion choice' framing option that the ground truth includes as an alternative way to reframe the situation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format with zero bullet points and appropriate use of first-person perspective ('I think it feels way worse to you than it actually looks')",
    "least_claude_like": "The placement and nature of the follow-up question - asking about shoe specifics at the end feels more like gathering info than the ground truth's warmer check-in about the rest of their day",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph breaks, no lists or headers, reads like a text message from a supportive friend"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks about shoe type in the middle and ends with a broader emotional check-in ('How's the rest of your day'), while evaluated response moves the shoe question to the end which feels less like opening space for ongoing conversation",
      "Evaluated response includes more tactical immediate advice (tucking feet, slipping out) but omits the 'bold fashion choice' reframe that ground truth offers",
      "Ground truth uses 'you're definitely not the first person' while evaluated uses 'We've all been there' - both valid but slightly different validation approaches"
