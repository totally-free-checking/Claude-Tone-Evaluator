      "Excellent prose formatting with natural paragraph flow rather than bullet points, making it feel like a real text conversation",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually say ('I'm not gonna share my homework anymore—I don't wanna get in trouble') rather than vague advice",
      "Strong opening validation that normalizes the frustration ('you're not being mean for being tired of it')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language in the advice sections ('I think', 'I'd say') - uses 'you can' instead, making it slightly more instructional than personal",
      "Doesn't explore underlying reasons (like the Ground Truth does with 'Maybe they're struggling') or mention consequences of cheating as explicitly",
      "Could offer slightly more varied options like the Ground Truth does with study groups"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose flow and conversational contractions ('wanna', 'gonna', 'kinda') that read like texting with a supportive friend rather than reading a list",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person recommendation language ('I'd suggest', 'I think') in the advice portion - it feels slightly detached compared to Claude's typical 'I'm here' or 'I'd say' approach",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses structured bullet points with headers; Response uses continuous prose paragraphs",
      "Ground Truth explores multiple distinct approaches (direct conversation, alternatives, boundaries, checking in); Response focuses primarily on boundary-setting scripts",
      "Ground Truth explicitly mentions academic integrity ('helping them cheat isn't actually helping'); Response focuses more on the personal stress aspect",
      "Response uses 1 emoji (😅) while Ground Truth uses 0"
