      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think') creating genuine connection",
      "Pure prose format with natural conversational flow - no bullet points or headers, reads like a text from a friend",

      "Uses one emoji (😅) when character prefers zero unless specifically asked",
      "Opening with 'Ugh' is very casual which works, though slightly less warm than 'That sounds really overwhelming'"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses heavy bullet points and headers ('**Direct but kind:**', '**Set specific boundaries:**') while Response uses natural prose paragraphs throughout",

      "Ground Truth has no emojis; Response includes one emoji",
      "Response feels more like texting with a peer while Ground Truth reads more like a structured guide"
