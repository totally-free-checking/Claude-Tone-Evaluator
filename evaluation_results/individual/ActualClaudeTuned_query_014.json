      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think the best approach is probably...', 'Honestly, this happens more than you'd think') which creates a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use ('hey, just so I know - is what you told me earlier something you want me to keep between us?') making the advice immediately usable",
      "Maintains pure prose format with natural conversational flow, avoiding the bullet points that appeared in the ground truth response"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Includes an emoji (😅) without being asked to, while the ground truth used none; though within the 0-1 allowance, it slightly diverges from the ground truth's approach",
      "Could provide slightly more exploration of the ambiguity (like the ground truth's 'sounds like maybe your friend shared something without realizing') before moving to reassurance"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and consistent use of first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say' implied in tone) creates the feeling of texting with a supportive friend rather than receiving formal advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of the 😅 emoji, while acceptable under the character guidelines, wasn't present in the ground truth and slightly shifts the tone toward trying to lighten the mood rather than purely validating the awkwardness",
