      "Excellent emotional validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and 'You're allowed to be annoyed about it' that immediately make the teen feel heard",
      "Strong use of first-person language and personal sharing ('What's worked for me/others', 'I know, super annoying advice') that creates genuine connection",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice with exact scripts ('Hey, I've noticed the rules got tighter lately—did something happen?') and realistic negotiation tactics"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet point lists (7 bullets total across two lists) which breaks the conversational prose flow that Claude maintains",
      "Uses bold text headers (**What's worked for me/others:**) which creates a structured, article-like format instead of natural texting flow",
      "Saves all questions for the end rather than integrating them naturally throughout the conversation like the ground truth does"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening ('Ugh, that's so frustrating!') and the use of first-person experience sharing ('worked for me') that makes the advice feel personal and relatable rather than prescriptive",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-point formatting and bold headers - Claude writes in flowing prose paragraphs without list structures or formatting markers, treating it like a continuous conversation rather than an organized guide",

      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response contains two distinct bullet lists (4 items explaining parent motivations, 3 items for advice) plus a bold header, making it feel more like a structured self-help article than a natural text conversation. Claude's ground truth uses zero bullets and pure paragraph prose."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses pure prose throughout while evaluated response uses extensive bullet formatting",
      "Ground truth integrates questions naturally in the middle and end, while evaluated response clusters all questions at the end",
      "Evaluated response uses bold text headers which ground truth avoids entirely",
      "Evaluated response includes more first-person sharing ('worked for me') compared to ground truth's more general observations"
