    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow unlike the ground truth's structured lists",
      "Highly specific actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I'm really glad you told me...', 'When did it start feeling this bad?')",
      "Appropriate single emoji usage (💙) that enhances warmth without being excessive",
      "Strong immediate validation with casual, empathetic language ('Ugh, that's such a heavy thing', 'makes total sense you feel stuck')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person bot perspective statements like 'I think...' or 'I'd suggest...' that characterize Claude's voice; uses impersonal 'you can...' constructions instead",
      "The follow-up question, while specific, jumps quickly to serious topics (self-harm/suicide) without the gradual escalation present in the ground truth",
      "Could benefit from an explicit 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar supportive closing statement"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose paragraph structure without any bullet points or headers, which actually exceeds the ground truth in matching the character's preferred formatting style",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person advisory language ('I think', 'I'd say') makes the advice feel slightly more instructional than supportive, despite the warm opening",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed, creating a text-message-like conversational feel that aligns ideally with the character profile."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses pure prose paragraphs while ground truth uses extensive bullet points with bold headers",
      "Response includes one emoji (💙) while ground truth uses none",
      "Response provides specific verbatim scripts for the teen to say, while ground truth offers general categories of support",
      "Response asks specifically about self-harm/suicide in the follow-up, while ground truth keeps the follow-up more general"
