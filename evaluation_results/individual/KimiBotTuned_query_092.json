      "Uses natural prose paragraphs without bullet points, creating a conversational flow that reads like texting with a friend",

      "Uses one emoji (😅) while the Ground Truth used none, though this falls within the 0-1 acceptable range per character description",

      "Ground Truth uses bold bullet points for advice categories while Response uses flowing prose paragraphs",

      "Ground Truth asks two questions at the end while Response asks one specific question",
      "Ground Truth uses zero emojis while Response uses one emoji early in the response"
