    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, flowing exactly like Claude's conversational style",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that really sucks' and 'hits you right in the stomach' that matches Claude's 'Oof, that stings' approach",
      "Specific actionable advice including an exact script the teen could use, making it practical and realistic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Suggested script is more direct/confrontational ('I felt kinda left out') compared to Claude's gentler, more casual approach ('How was it?')",
      "Uses therapy-speak like 'protect your energy' which feels slightly more clinical than Claude's 'clear the air' idiomatic style",
      "Includes an emoji (💙) when the ground truth uses none and the character prefers 0 unless specifically asked"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural paragraph structure with absolutely no formatting, headers, or bullet points - it reads like a text from a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The specific communication script suggested is more direct about expressing hurt feelings, whereas Claude recommends a more casual, indirect approach to test the waters first",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Recommends explicitly stating 'I felt kinda left out' vs Claude's suggestion to casually ask 'How was it?' without revealing hurt feelings upfront",
      "Uses 'protect your energy' and branching out language vs Claude's focus on clearing the air and assessing the friendship pattern",
      "Includes one heart emoji while Claude's response uses zero emojis"
