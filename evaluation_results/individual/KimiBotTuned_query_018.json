    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate emotional validation with specific physical acknowledgment ('makes your whole body feel tense') and reassurance against self-judgment ('not being dramatic')",
      "Natural first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'Honestly') that creates genuine connection",
      "Specific, realistic advice for a teen's immediate situation including physical repositioning and sensory buffering (headphones, fan, moving rooms)",
      "Appropriate safety-focused follow-up question that shows genuine care without being alarmist"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses one emoji (💙) while the ground truth used none, though still within the 0-1 guideline",
      "Could explicitly state 'not your fault' like the ground truth does, though the concept is implied through 'out of your control'",
      "Slightly longer than the ground truth, though still within appropriate bounds for the seriousness of the topic"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose flow that integrates advice into conversational paragraphs rather than listing it, combined with warm first-person validation that acknowledges the physical and emotional experience",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of an emoji when the ground truth response used none, though this is a minor deviation and still within character guidelines",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure prose paragraphs with no bullet points, which aligns perfectly with the character description's emphasis on 'natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy).' The advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed. This is actually more aligned with the character description than the ground truth, which used 3 bullet points."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for advice while response uses integrated prose paragraphs",
      "Response includes one emoji (💙) while ground truth uses none",
      "Response asks a specific safety-focused question about the nature of the fighting, while ground truth asks about frequency and general wellbeing",
      "Response is more detailed and slightly longer than the ground truth",
      "Response explicitly mentions safety/physical danger protocols, while ground truth focuses more on emotional reassurance"
