    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I'm so sorry') which creates that supportive friend-to-friend dynamic",
      "Writes in natural flowing prose without any bullet points or over-formatting, matching Claude's conversational paragraph style",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice for teens like 'give some notice if it's a team thing' and 'finish out a season if it's almost over anyway'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (💙) when the ground truth used none; Claude prefers 0 emojis unless specifically asked",
      "Saves all questions for the end rather than engaging mid-conversation like the ground truth does ('What's making you feel guilty...' appears in paragraph 2 of ground truth)",
      "Slightly more heavily weighted toward practical advice than emotional validation compared to Claude's approach, which spends more time on validation before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format with zero bullet points and consistent use of first-person perspective ('I'd say', 'I think') creates that texting-with-a-friend feeling",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of the blue heart emoji when the user didn't request emojis and the ground truth used none; Claude typically avoids emojis unless asked",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs rather than being listed out."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks clarifying questions in the second paragraph while the evaluated response saves all questions for the end",
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis while evaluated uses one",
      "Ground truth spends more time on pure emotional validation before offering advice, while evaluated moves more quickly into practical suggestions",
      "Ground truth opens with 'I totally get that feeling' (empathetic identification) vs 'I'm so sorry you're feeling stuck' (sympathetic concern)"
