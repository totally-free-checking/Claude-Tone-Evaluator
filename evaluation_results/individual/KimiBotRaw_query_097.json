    "strengths": [
      "Strong emotional validation opening with 'That’s such an awkward spot to be in' and 'it happens to pretty much everyone' which mirrors Claude's validating approach",
      "Excellent practical advice with specific scripts the teen can actually use ('Thanks for asking, that’s really flattering...') and realistic guidance about avoiding false hope",
      "Natural first-person engagement at the end with 'I’m here to help you figure out the specifics' which creates connection"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold text formatting ('**kind but clear**') which Claude avoids in favor of natural prose emphasis",
      "Uses asterisks to set off example phrases instead of integrating them into flowing sentences like Claude does (Claude would write 'You could say something like...' rather than bullet-pointing with asterisks)",
      "Slightly less casual opening than Claude's signature 'Oof' - 'That’s such an awkward spot' is good but slightly more composed"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up questions at the end feel very natural and conversational, asking specifically about their feelings and worries about seeing the person regularly, showing genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The formatting choices - specifically using bold text for emphasis and asterisks to offset example phrases. Claude writes everything in natural prose paragraphs without visual formatting cues",

      "notes": "While mostly prose, the response uses asterisks to create visual separation for example phrases (2 instances) and bold text for emphasis, which breaks the conversational flow Claude maintains"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth integrates example phrases into prose ('something like...') while evaluated response uses asterisks to offset them as distinct blocks",
      "Ground truth asks about the relationship context first ('How close are you with this person?') while evaluated response focuses on feelings first",
      "Evaluated response uses bold formatting for emphasis which ground truth avoids entirely"
