    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation: 'That’s really not okay—you’re absolutely right to be done with it' acknowledges the user's feelings immediately",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy formatting with bold headers (**Set a hard boundary**, **Document it**) and bullet points makes it read like a safety manual rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I'm here' to create personal connection; feels impersonal and authoritative rather than supportive",
      "Tone shifts to adult authority figure ('loop in HR', 'Document it', 'keep your phone accessible') rather than warm peer support"

      "notes": "Uses four bold headers with bullet points underneath, creating a structured, list-heavy format that diverges significantly from Claude's conversational paragraph style. The 'Safety first' section uses dashes like Claude's ground truth, but the overall structure is much more formatted and hierarchical."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses simple prose paragraphs with minimal formatting; response uses bold headers and heavy bullet structuring",
      "Ground truth maintains warm, peer-like tone throughout; response shifts to protective adult/authority figure giving safety instructions",
      "Ground truth balances emotional validation with advice; response is heavily weighted toward action steps and safety planning with less emotional support",
      "Ground truth uses natural conversational flow; response uses imperative commands ('Start writing down', 'Avoid being alone') without first-person connection"
