      "Opens with strong immediate validation ('Ugh, that's so frustrating!') and uses first-person empathy ('I totally get why that would bug you') throughout",
      "Provides specific, actionable conversation scripts that a teen could actually use ('I've noticed you've been getting into a lot of the same stuff as me lately...')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Frames advice as 'options' ('I think you've got a couple of options here'), which is slightly more structured than Claude's typical seamless prose flow",
      "Explores the 'why' behind the copying as statement rather than engaging question, whereas ground truth asks 'Have you noticed if they're doing it consciously...' to draw the user out"
