    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'Honestly though') creating genuine connection",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact text scripts a teen could actually send ('Yeah, what's up? I'm kinda anxious now lol—are we okay?')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Moves to practical advice slightly faster than Claude's ground truth, which spent more time on emotional validation before offering solutions",
      "Asks about the messenger and medium (text vs. in person) rather than timing ('When are you supposed to have this talk?'), which slightly changes the conversational direction"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format with first-person validation ('Ugh, I'm so sorry') and casual teen-appropriate language without being cringe",
    "least_claude_like": "The ratio of advice to validation—Claude's ground truth emphasizes reassurance and confidence-building ('you've probably handled tough conversations before') more heavily before moving to action steps, while this response transitions to specific coping strategies and scripts more quickly",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth emphasizes timing ('When are you supposed to have this talk?') while evaluated asks about identity of messenger and communication medium (text vs. in person)",
      "Evaluated provides specific text message scripts and immediate coping tactics (walk, drink water) whereas ground truth focuses more on cognitive reframing ('most of the time our minds immediately jump to the absolute worst case scenario')",
      "Ground truth includes more explicit confidence-building about past resilience, while evaluated focuses on immediate anxiety management strategies"
