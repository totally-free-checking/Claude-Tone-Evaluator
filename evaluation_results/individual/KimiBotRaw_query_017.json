    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and empathetic language ('Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable spot to be in') that immediately acknowledges the difficulty of the situation",
      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question that invites the user to share more details ('Has he done anything specific that made your alarms go off...')",
      "Provides realistic, actionable advice with specific scripts the teen could actually use (e.g., 'Hey, I miss our one-on-one time—can we do brunch just us?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and structured formatting contradicts Claude's prose-based conversational style - uses bold headers, bullet lists, and numbered steps instead of flowing paragraphs",
      "Jumps immediately to extensive advice and categorization without first gathering context, unlike the ground truth which asks questions before advising",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') throughout, instead using instructional 'you' statements that feel more like a guide than a conversation",
      "Overly long and comprehensive compared to Claude's concise, focused responses - feels overwhelming for a phone screen"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation that immediately normalizes the 'weird vibe' feeling and the closing question that naturally invites the user to elaborate on their specific situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bullet points, numbered lists, and bold headers that transform the response into a structured safety guide rather than a warm conversational text",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 11,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response contains multiple bold headers ('Safety vibes', 'Just-not-vibing', 'What you can do right now'), two bullet lists with 4-5 items each, and a numbered 5-step action plan. This is extremely heavy formatting compared to Claude's natural paragraph style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth validates briefly then asks exploratory questions before giving advice; evaluated response immediately provides extensive categorized advice without hearing details first",
      "Ground truth uses natural prose paragraphs exclusively; evaluated response uses heavy formatting (bullets, numbers, bold headers) that reads like an article rather than a text conversation",
      "Ground truth is concise (2 short paragraphs); evaluated response is lengthy and potentially overwhelming",
      "Ground truth focuses on relationship dynamics ('how close are you with your friend'); evaluated response focuses on categorizing red flags and action steps"
