    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong immediate validation using casual language like 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and 'that seriously sucks' which matches Claude's empathetic tone",
      "Follow-up question is specific and engaging: 'Who's doing the comparing—your parents, relatives, teachers… and is it about grades, sports, looks, or something else?' showing genuine interest in the details",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout like 'I'm so sorry' and provides realistic, actionable scripts a teen could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The middle paragraph is overly structured with repetitive 'If... then...' conditional statements ('If it's safe to say something...' 'If you don't want a whole conversation...' 'And if it's your sibling...') which reads more like a strategy guide than conversational prose",
      "Heavy imbalance toward practical advice over emotional validation - approximately 70% of the response is solution-oriented scripts versus Claude's approach which would offer more space to vent first",
      "Lacks the deeper emotional acknowledgment present in the ground truth about feeling 'not good enough as you are' and the competition aspect"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation paragraph which immediately acknowledges the 'gross, stuck feeling' and uses casual, empathetic language like 'Ugh' and 'seriously sucks' to establish warmth",
    "least_claude_like": "The multi-scenario advice section that lays out three different conditional strategies with specific scripts - Claude would typically offer one gentle suggestion woven into prose or simply invite venting rather than providing a communication playbook",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "85%",
      "notes": "While no actual bullet points are used, the second paragraph employs a repetitive conditional structure ('If X... If Y... And if Z...') that functions similarly to a bulleted list of options, making it feel more structured and less conversational than Claude's natural prose flow"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses primarily on validation and invites venting, while evaluated response immediately jumps to problem-solving with specific communication scripts",
      "Ground truth maintains pure conversational prose throughout, while evaluated response uses structured conditional formatting for advice delivery",
      "Ground truth emphasizes the emotional impact of feeling unseen and the unfairness of the comparison more deeply, whereas evaluated response focuses on practical boundary-setting strategies"
