      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ughhh nooo, that's *so* embarrassing') that mirrors Claude's empathetic approach",
      "Uses natural prose paragraphs without any bullet points or over-formatting, maintaining conversational flow",
      "Provides specific, realistic advice including exact phrases to say ('Oh my god, sorry, long day') that teens can actually use"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective in advice sections ('I think', 'I'd say') compared to Claude's 'I totally get' and personal voice",
      "Slightly heavier on practical solutions versus emotional validation compared to the ground truth which spends more time normalizing and comforting",
      "Uses italics for emphasis (*so*) which isn't typical in Claude's responses"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow that reads like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column",
    "least_claude_like": "The impersonal phrasing in the advice section ('the easiest move is' rather than 'I'd just' or 'I think') which creates slight distance rather than shared perspective",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses more heavily on validation and normalization before offering perspective, while the response moves more quickly to specific action steps",
      "Ground truth uses explicit first-person empathy ('I totally get'), while the response uses second-person observation ('that feeling is the worst')",
      "Response provides specific scripting for what to say, whereas Claude offers more general reassurance about the teacher's perspective"
