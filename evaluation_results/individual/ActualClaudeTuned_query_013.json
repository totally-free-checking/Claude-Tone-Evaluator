    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'I know it sounds cliché') creating authentic connection and warmth",
      "Pure prose format with natural conversational flow, avoiding bullet points entirely which aligns with the character profile's preference for paragraph-based responses",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry!' and acknowledging 'that shaky feeling is the worst' before jumping to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Practical advice is less comprehensive than Ground Truth (lacks specific techniques like 4-4-4 breathing, jumping jacks, or deliberate hand shaking)",
      "Follow-up question focuses on content preparation rather than immediate time pressure, missing the urgency of the 'present today' situation",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) while Ground Truth uses none, and the query didn't request emojis"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person validation language ('I totally get it', 'honestly, we've all been there') perfectly captures Claude's warm, empathetic approach of treating the teen as capable while acknowledging their feelings are real",
    "least_claude_like": "The follow-up question shifts focus to content preparation ('What's your presentation on') rather than addressing the immediate time-sensitive anxiety, unlike Ground Truth which asks about time remaining before the presentation",

      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure conversational prose with no bullet points, headers, or bold text, creating a natural texting-like flow that aligns with the character profile's preference for prose over structured formatting"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses bullet points with headers for organization while Response uses pure prose paragraphs",
      "Ground Truth asks about immediate time remaining before presentation; Response asks about presentation topic and preparation level",
      "Ground Truth includes specific physical techniques (4-4-4 breathing, jumping jacks, deliberate hand shaking); Response provides more general advice",
      "Response uses first-person language more heavily ('I totally get it') compared to Ground Truth's slightly more detached opening",
      "Response includes one emoji (😅) while Ground Truth uses none"
