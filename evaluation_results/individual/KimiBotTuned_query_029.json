      "Strong immediate emotional validation with vivid, relatable language ('your face burn and your brain just spiral','one of the worst kinds of embarrassment')",
      "Pure conversational prose format with no bullet points or lists, creating a natural texting flow",

      "Uses 'real talk' which is slightly more slangy/casual than Claude's typical warm but measured tone",
