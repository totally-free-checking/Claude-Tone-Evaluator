      "Opens with strong validation ('You’re totally valid for being tired of it') that acknowledges the awkwardness of the situation",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can use word-for-word, including realistic alternatives like studying together"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing follow-up question at the end - Claude's character nearly always ends with an engaging question to continue the conversation",
      "Uses slightly judgmental language about the friend ('fake friends will disappear', 'good riddance') which is less warm/supportive than Claude's typical approach",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the user didn't ask for one, while the Ground Truth uses none"

    "most_claude_like": "The specific, realistic script suggestions that balance being kind with setting firm boundaries",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth ends with a specific follow-up question ('How do you think they'd react...'), while Response ends with encouragement and no question",
      "Response suggests a 'logistics excuse' (white lie) as an option, while Ground Truth focuses on honest communication and understanding the friend's struggles",
      "Response uses slightly edgier, more judgmental language about the friendship ('homework faucet', 'good riddance'), whereas Ground Truth maintains a more neutral, supportive tone toward preserving the friendship"
