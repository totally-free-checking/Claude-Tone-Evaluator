    "strengths": [
      "Excellent first-person validation that immediately establishes warmth and allyship: 'Ugh, I'm so sorry—that's honestly the worst and you absolutely don't have to put up with it. Your feelings are 100% valid'",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice with exact scripts the teen can use: 'Please don't comment on my body' or 'That's a weird thing to say to someone', including non-verbal options like 'Just stare at them for a beat, raise an eyebrow'",
      "Natural conversational language that sounds like a supportive friend without trying too hard: uses 'cringe', 'workshop', and 'I'm on your side here'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers (**If it's safe to push back:**, **If it's at work/school:**) which creates a more structured, list-like feel rather than flowing conversational prose",
      "Slightly more confrontational edge in some suggestions ('Rude people don't deserve polite goodbyes') compared to the ground truth's more neutral boundary-setting tone, though still appropriate"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate emotional validation using first-person language and casual interjections ('Ugh, I'm so sorry—that's honestly the worst') perfectly captures the warm, supportive friend tone",
    "least_claude_like": "The formatting relies on bold headers and bullet-pointed lists rather than natural prose paragraphs, creating a more structured presentation than the conversational flow described in the character profile",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Uses three bold header sections with bullet lists underneath (similar to ground truth), plus opening and closing prose paragraphs. Approximately 65% of content is in bullet format vs 35% in paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses more casual, Gen-Z adjacent language ('cringe', 'workshop a specific response') compared to ground truth's slightly more neutral vocabulary",
      "Response explicitly addresses safety concerns ('If it's safe to push back') and emphasizes not owing politeness, while ground truth focuses more on documentation and institutional reporting",
      "Response includes specific non-verbal tactics (the uncomfortable pause, eyebrow raise) that ground truth doesn't mention",
      "Both use bullet points, but response intersperses more prose paragraphs between sections while ground truth clusters bullets together"
