      "Opens with strong validation and empathy ('That's exciting but also super nerve-wracking, I get it') that acknowledges both the excitement and anxiety",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks a follow-up question at the end, which is a core characteristic of Claude's approach (ends with 'Good luck! 🎉' instead of engaging the user further)",
      "Uses heavy formatting with bold section headers (**Pick your moment**, **Lead with the details**, etc.) that makes it read more like a wikiHow article than a conversational text from a friend",
      "Shifts to impersonal imperative commands ('Pick your moment', 'Lead with the details') rather than using first-person suggestions ('I think you should', 'I'd suggest')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation that immediately acknowledges the mixed emotions ('exciting but also super nerve-wracking, I get it') captures the warm, empathetic tone perfectly",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any follow-up question to continue the conversation - Claude nearly always ends with a specific, engaging question to invite the teen to share more",

      "notes": "Uses 5 bold headers (**Pick your moment**, **Lead with the details**, **Anticipate the worry**, **Offer a compromise**, **If they say no…**) that function as section dividers/bullets, plus blockquote formatting for example dialogue. While the content under headers is prose paragraphs rather than bullet lists, the heavy structuring creates a formatted, instructional feel rather than natural flowing conversation."

      "Ground Truth ends with a specific follow-up question ('What kind of party is it?') while the Response ends with a generic sign-off and emoji without engaging the user to share more",
      "Ground Truth uses simple dash bullets under headers, while Response uses bold headers with prose paragraphs and blockquotes, creating a more formatted, instructional appearance",
      "Response provides much more detailed scripting and scenario planning, while Ground Truth offers broader categories with less prescriptive language"
