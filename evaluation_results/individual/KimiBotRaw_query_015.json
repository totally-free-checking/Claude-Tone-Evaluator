    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation: 'Ugh, that is *so* frustrating. Having your privacy invaded like that—especially by family—makes your blood boil' captures the emotional intensity well",
      "Follow-up question is natural and specific: 'What kind of stuff are they getting into—like random clutter, or things that actually matter to you?' mirrors Claude's approach of asking about specifics to continue the conversation",
      "Practical advice is highly specific and teen-realistic: mentioning '$10 on Amazon', 'suitcase with combination lock', and 'inside an old textbook' shows understanding of teen constraints"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy over-formatting with bold headers and bullet points throughout: uses **tactical damage control:**, **The conversation (when you're calmer):**, **If you're minors living at home:** which reads like a wikiHow article rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Completely lacks first-person language: no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', or 'I'm here if you need to talk' - instead uses impersonal second-person instructional tone ('Don't accuse', 'Try', 'Loop in your parents')",
      "Imbalanced toward tactical solutions over emotional support: after brief validation, immediately jumps to 'breathe for a sec' and extensive damage control strategies without maintaining the warm, empathetic presence throughout"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation phrase 'Ugh, that is *so* frustrating' and the specific follow-up question at the end about what kind of stuff they're going through",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bold headers, bullet points, and structured tactical advice formatting that makes it read like an instruction manual rather than a conversational text from a supportive friend",

      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response is heavily structured with bold section headers (**tactical damage control**, **The conversation**, etc.) and multiple bullet lists throughout. Unlike Claude's ground truth which uses 1 brief bullet list within mostly prose, this response uses bullets as the primary format with prose as connectors."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses natural prose paragraphs with minimal formatting; evaluated response uses bold headers and extensive bullet points like a self-help guide",
      "Ground truth uses first-person conversational language ('I'd say', 'I think' implied through casual tone); evaluated response is entirely second-person instructional ('Don't accuse', 'Get a lock', 'Loop in parents')",
      "Ground truth maintains warm, empathetic tone throughout; evaluated response shifts quickly to tactical/cautionary mode ('let's make sure you don't actually lose it in a way that gets you in trouble')"
