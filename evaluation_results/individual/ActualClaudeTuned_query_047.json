    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I totally get', 'I'd say' implied in tone) creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points, making it feel like a text from a friend rather than a list of instructions",
      "Strong emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and acknowledging specific feelings like embarrassment and unfairness"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is slightly less comprehensive than the ground truth (asks only about the outing type, not age)",
      "Could slightly increase the ratio of practical advice to validation - currently heavy on the emotional support side compared to the ground truth"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format without any bullet points or headers, using casual language like 'Ugh' and 'super unfair' while maintaining first-person perspective throughout",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of an emoji (😅) when the ground truth uses none, though this is still within the 0-1 acceptable range for the character",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, which actually aligns better with the character description than the ground truth (which uses 4 bullet points). Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than listed."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses pure prose while ground truth uses bullet points for advice section",
      "Response includes one emoji (😅) while ground truth uses none",
      "Response asks only about the type of outing; ground truth asks about both age and outing type",
      "Response emphasizes 'earning privilege' and specific logistics (hourly check-ins); ground truth emphasizes building trust gradually and showing responsibility in other areas"
