    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, maintaining natural conversational flow throughout",
      "Strong validation of gut feelings with empathetic language like 'your body's already on alert' and 'you're not being dramatic'",
      "Highly specific, actionable safety advice including exact phrases to use with the friend and concrete boundary-setting steps"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language (e.g., 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' 'I get it') that characterizes Claude's voice, making it feel slightly more instructional than personal",
      "Significantly longer and more advice-heavy than Claude's typical concise, question-focused approach; ground truth prioritizes exploration while this jumps to solutions",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the user didn't request one, whereas Claude's ground truth response used zero emojis"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format without any bullet points, headers, or over-structuring reads exactly like Claude's conversational texting style",
    "least_claude_like": "The density and length of practical advice compared to Claude's more concise, exploratory approach in the ground truth, which focuses more on asking questions than prescribing specific safety protocols",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs using conversational transitions like 'If you can, keep it simple...'"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses on exploratory questions about the friendship dynamic and specifics; evaluated response prioritizes immediate safety advice and boundary-setting",
      "Ground truth is concise (2 short paragraphs) while evaluated response is substantially longer with detailed safety protocols",
      "Ground truth asks about friendship closeness ('how close are you with your friend') which is absent in the evaluated response",
      "Evaluated response uses one emoji while ground truth uses zero"
