    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation with phrases like 'you're not lazy or broken for this' and acknowledging the spiral of guilt",
      "Highly specific actionable advice including exact wording for emailing teachers about late assignments",
      "Maintains natural prose format without over-formatting or bullet points"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel less like a personal conversation and more like general advice",
      "Advice section is dense and packed into one long paragraph rather than being broken up conversationally"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that immediately normalizes the procrastination and removes shame ('your brain just freezes, and then you feel guilty')",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective throughout - it reads as impersonal general advice rather than 'I'd say' or 'I think' personal guidance",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points or bold headers, which aligns with the prose preference, though the advice paragraph is quite dense compared to Ground Truth's bold-header breaks"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "No first-person 'I' statements vs Ground Truth's 'when I'm talking to people in your situation'",
      "Provides specific email script template for teachers whereas Ground Truth gives broader strategic principles",
      "Uses 😅 early in response vs Ground Truth's 🙂 at the end; both use 1 emoji appropriately"
