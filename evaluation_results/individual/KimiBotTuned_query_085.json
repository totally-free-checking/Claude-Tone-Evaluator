    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a genuine text conversation between friends",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice with exact phrases the teen can use ('I'm not trying to pick sides, I'm gonna step away') and concrete actions (put headphones in, take a bathroom break)",
      "Strong emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that's so draining' and acknowledging the 'walking on eggshells' feeling without dismissing the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Gives extensive advice before asking clarifying questions, whereas Ground Truth asks exploratory questions first ('Are we talking like heated debates...') to understand the situation before advising",
      "Uses first-person language primarily within role-play examples ('I'm not trying to pick sides') rather than in reflective meta-commentary (lacks explicit 'I think' or 'I'd say' framing outside of examples)",
      "Slightly longer than Ground Truth, packing multiple specific strategies into one paragraph rather than spacing them out or keeping it brief"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose paragraph structure without any bullet points, headers, or formatting, maintaining a conversational flow that feels like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The advice-heavy structure that provides specific solutions and scripts immediately rather than first asking clarifying questions to understand the dynamic better",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, numbered lists, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences and paragraphs rather than being listed out."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth asks clarifying questions about the nature/timing of the arguing before offering any advice, while Response to Evaluate jumps directly into specific solutions and scripts",
      "Response to Evaluate is significantly longer (3 paragraphs of advice vs Ground Truth's 1 paragraph) and more detailed in its recommendations",
      "Response to Evaluate uses one emoji (😅) while Ground Truth uses none, and Ground Truth uses more 'you' focused validation while Response to Evaluate mixes 'you' validation with immediate practical strategies"
