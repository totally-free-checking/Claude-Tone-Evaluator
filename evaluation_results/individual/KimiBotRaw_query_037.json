    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate, relatable validation using casual interjection 'Ugh' and physical description of anxiety ('stomach drop') that teens would instantly recognize",
      "Uses first-person supportive language naturally ('I'm here if you want to vent') creating genuine connection rather than distant advice-giving",
      "Maintains pure conversational prose throughout with no formatting crutches - flows like a text message from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with a supportive statement rather than a specific question, whereas Claude typically closes with an engaging question to continue the conversation",
      "Offers distraction as an option which is supportive, but could include slightly more specific guidance on how to process the situation before offering escape routes"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and immediate emotional validation using physical/somatic language ('stomach drop') perfectly captures how Claude validates teen experiences without over-structuring the response",
    "least_claude_like": "The closing shifts to 'I'm here if you want...' rather than ending with an open question like 'Want to talk through what happened?' - it invites sharing but doesn't actively prompt continuation with a question",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or bold text. Three natural paragraphs that flow like a conversation."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth ends with explicit question 'Want to talk through what happened?' while evaluated ends with supportive availability statement",
      "Ground truth uses 'I can imagine' to show empathy, while evaluated uses 'I'm here' - both first-person but different approaches",
      "Evaluated offers 'distraction' as a third option which is a nice teen-specific touch not present in ground truth"
