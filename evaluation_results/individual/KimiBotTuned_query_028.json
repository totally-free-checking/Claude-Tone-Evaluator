      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points, maintaining natural conversational flow throughout",

      "Specific, actionable advice including exact wording for the apology text"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question is actually three questions combined ('What did you say... and was it... and how did they react'), which feels overwhelming rather than naturally conversational",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I'd probably') when giving advice, using more impersonal phrasing like 'the safest move is' and 'you can say'",
      "Slightly heavier focus on practical solutions compared to the ground truth, which lingered longer on pure emotional validation"

      "Ground truth focuses primarily on emotional validation and reflection, while evaluated response quickly moves to specific scripting/what to say",
      "Ground truth asks simple, singular follow-up questions ('What happened?'), while evaluated response asks multiple questions at once",
      "Ground truth uses 'Oh no' expression of empathy; evaluated uses 'Ugh' and includes one emoji (😅) which ground truth omits"
