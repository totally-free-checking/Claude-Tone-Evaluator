    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - reads exactly like a text conversation with a supportive friend",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('My stomach would be in knots', 'I'd just ask', 'I know it's easier said than done') that creates genuine connection",
      "Warm, validating opening that immediately normalizes the anxiety with 'We've all been there' and acknowledges the physical stress response"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Only asks one follow-up question (who) versus Claude's approach of asking two specific questions (who and when) to fully engage the conversation",
      "Missing specific contextual reassurance that Claude provides about what the talk might actually be about (scheduling conflicts, advice, etc.) which helps reduce anxiety",
      "Lacks the specific grounding technique ('Take a deep breath') and reminder of past resilience ('you've probably handled tough conversations before') that Claude includes"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and conversational first-person tone that flows like a text message from a supportive older sibling, completely avoiding lists or over-structuring",
    "least_claude_like": "The single follow-up question at the end - Claude typically asks multiple engaging questions to keep the conversation going, particularly missing the 'when' question which is crucial for someone experiencing anticipatory anxiety",

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude asks two follow-up questions (who and when) to fully contextualize the situation and help with planning, while this response only asks about the person",
      "Ground truth includes specific examples of benign reasons for the talk (scheduling, advice) to counter catastrophic thinking, while this response keeps it more general",
      "Claude explicitly reminds the user of their past resilience and ability to handle tough conversations, which this response omits"
