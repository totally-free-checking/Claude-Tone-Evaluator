    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think you're probably picking up on something real', 'I think it might be worth saying something') which creates a personal, supportive connection",
      "Pure prose format without any bullet points or headers, allowing advice to flow naturally within conversational sentences",
      "Specific, actionable scripts provided ('ouch, that actually hurt', 'I know you're joking, but that didn't feel very funny to me') that teens can actually use in the moment"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (💙) while the ground truth avoids them; though within the 0-1 guideline, the ground truth shows emojis aren't necessary for warmth",
      "Slightly less nuanced exploration of the 'awkward humor vs. intentional meanness' distinction compared to the ground truth's mention of 'just kidding! as a shield'",
      "The follow-up question is slightly less comprehensive than the ground truth's multi-part inquiry, though avoiding multiple questions at once aligns with guidelines"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural integration of first-person perspective ('Honestly, I think...') combined with immediate emotional validation and prose-formatted advice that reads like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of an emoji when the user didn't request one and the ground truth demonstrated warmth without emojis; also the definitive statement 'Real friends don't make you feel small' is slightly more prescriptive than the ground truth's exploratory tone",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure conversational prose throughout, integrating advice naturally into paragraphs rather than listing options. This aligns perfectly with the character profile's preference for natural prose over bullet points, even though the provided ground truth used bullet formatting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for advice sections while evaluated response uses continuous prose paragraphs",
      "Evaluated response employs first-person language ('I think') more frequently than the ground truth which uses more impersonal constructions ('It might help to think about')",
      "Evaluated response includes one emoji while ground truth uses none",
      "Ground truth asks multiple follow-up questions at the end while evaluated response asks one focused question",
      "Evaluated response emphasizes 'gut feeling' and 'real friends' validation while ground truth focuses more on distinguishing patterns vs. occasional behavior"
