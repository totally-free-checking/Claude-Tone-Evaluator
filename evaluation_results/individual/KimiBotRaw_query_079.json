    "strengths": [
      "Strong first-person language that creates connection ('I totally get that', 'I know that doesn't magically fix the feeling')",
      "Very specific, actionable advice tailored to teen contexts (library corners, pasta in thermos, timing strategies)",
      "Excellent follow-up question that identifies specific anxieties (chewing vs mess vs feeling 'on display')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers (**Start small**, **Distraction helps**, etc.) creates an over-structured, article-like feel instead of natural prose conversation",
      "Significantly longer than necessary - the 5 detailed sections with bold headers feel overwhelming compared to Claude's concise approach",
      "While warm, it lacks some of the immediate emotional validation phrasing like 'You're definitely not alone' that Claude uses"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person validation ('I totally get that') and the specific, situation-aware follow-up question at the end",
    "least_claude_like": "The formatting structure using bold headers for each piece of advice, which reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive text conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Uses 5 bold headers (**Start small**, **Distraction helps**, **The 'spotlight effect'**, **Easy foods**, **Timing**) with paragraph explanations underneath. This is significantly more structured than Claude's preference for simple inline dashes or pure prose. The bold headers create visual separation that breaks conversational flow."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses simple inline bullet dashes with short phrases; evaluated response uses bold headers with lengthy explanations, creating a listicle format",
      "Ground truth is concise (2 short paragraphs + 4 brief bullets); evaluated response is much longer with detailed sections that could overwhelm a teen reading on phone",
      "Ground truth validates more explicitly ('You're definitely not alone'); evaluated response moves quickly into structured advice"
