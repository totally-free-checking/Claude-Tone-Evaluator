    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' and 'you're not being dramatic' which acknowledges the legitimacy of their feelings",
      "Excellent follow-up question at the end that is specific to the situation ('What was it they ruined, and did they say sorry or act like it's no big deal?') showing genuine interest",
      "Provides concrete, realistic scripts a teen could actually use ('Hey, I'm upset because when I got it back it was ruined')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I'm here') which is essential to Claude's conversational, supportive friend persona - it reads as impersonal instructions rather than 'here's what I'd do'",
      "Jumps immediately to specific conflict resolution advice and scripts rather than first exploring the emotional context and what happened, unlike the ground truth which asks 'What happened exactly?' before advising",
      "Has a somewhat structured, instructional feel with sequential steps ('If you can...', 'and then follow with...', 'If they try...') rather than the natural flowing prose of the ground truth"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that immediately normalizes their feelings with 'of course you're mad' and 'you're not being dramatic' captures the supportive, non-judgmental tone perfectly",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') makes it feel like generic advice rather than a supportive friend sharing their thoughts; Claude consistently uses first-person to create intimacy",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "95%",
      "notes": "While technically prose, the response has a list-like instructional structure with sequential conditional statements ('If you can...', 'and then...', 'If they try...', 'And for the future...') that feels more like a guide than a natural conversation. The ground truth uses pure conversational flow without this step-by-step formatting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth prioritizes emotional exploration and asks clarifying questions before offering advice; this response immediately jumps to specific scripts and conflict resolution tactics",
      "Ground truth uses first-person language throughout ('I'm curious', 'you know?') to create a personal connection; this response uses exclusively second-person ('you can', 'you're not') creating distance",
      "Ground truth focuses on the friendship dynamics and feelings first; this focuses on the transactional aspect (replacement/payment) and boundary-setting immediately"
