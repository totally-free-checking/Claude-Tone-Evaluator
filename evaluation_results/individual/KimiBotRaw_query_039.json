      "Strong opening validation that acknowledges the emotional weight ('That sounds really heavy to carry')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Over-formatted with bold headers (**Try the translation approach**) that read like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') that makes Claude's tone personal and warm—uses impersonal 'Here are a few things' instead",

      "Ground truth uses simple dash bullets integrated into prose; evaluated uses bold article-style headers that dominate the structure",

      "Ground truth is concise (2-4 short paragraphs); evaluated is lengthy with heavy formatting that feels overwhelming on mobile"
