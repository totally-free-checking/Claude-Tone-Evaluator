    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language ('I think the key is...') which makes it feel like a real conversation with a supportive friend",
      "Natural conversational fillers ('you know?', 'kinda', 'like') and contractions that create an authentic teen-appropriate tone without trying too hard",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, allowing advice to flow naturally within paragraphs rather than feeling like a checklist"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Used an emoji (😅) without being asked to, whereas the character profile specifies not using emojis unless explicitly requested",
      "The follow-up question, while good, is slightly more specific/scenario-based than the ground truth's more open-ended inquiry about the nature of the discomfort"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format with first-person language ('I think') and casual phrasing that balances validation with practical advice without resorting to bullet points",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of an emoji without the user asking for one, which violates the specific instruction to not use emojis unless asked (even though it stayed within the 0-1 max limit)",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure prose paragraphs with no bullet points or headers, which aligns perfectly with the character profile's preference for natural prose over the bullet-heavy formatting seen in the ground truth"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses 4 bullet points for advice while response uses flowing prose paragraphs (response aligns better with character profile)",
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis while response uses one emoji early in the text",
      "Response uses first-person language ('I think') throughout whereas ground truth uses more impersonal phrasing ('The key is')",
      "Response's follow-up question asks about specific scenarios (school vs texting) while ground truth asks about the emotional dynamic (pushy vs social cues)"
