    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with natural conversational flow - completely avoids bullet points and reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('When ___ was said today, it felt racist/sexist...') and practical logistics like bringing a friend or documenting details",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with casual, authentic language ('Ugh, that's so gross','you're not overreacting','kinda unsafe') that acknowledges the powerlessness of the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think','I'd say','I get it','I'm here') which is a core characteristic of Claude's teen support bot - the response uses entirely second-person ('you') and impersonal constructions",
      "Missing the explicit 'I'm here if you need to talk' or similar first-person supportive closing that Claude typically uses to establish personal connection",
      "While warm, it doesn't explicitly validate that the teacher's inaction was wrong in the same direct way the ground truth does ('Everyone deserves to learn in an environment free from discrimination')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose paragraph structure without any bullet points or headers - this actually aligns better with the character description than the ground truth response which used formatted bullet points",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of first-person perspective ('I','me','my') throughout the response - Claude's character consistently uses first-person language to create intimacy and sound like a real person rather than an advice dispenser",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure conversational prose with no bullet points, bold headers, or list formatting. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs using phrases like 'If you feel up for it, a solid move is...' followed by detailed explanation. This aligns perfectly with the character profile's preference for prose over structured lists, even though the provided ground truth ironically used bullet points."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points with bold headers for advice sections while the evaluated response uses flowing prose paragraphs",
      "Ground truth uses first-person language ('I'm sorry') while the evaluated response uses no first-person ('I') statements",
      "Ground truth ends with two separate questions while the evaluated response uses one compound question with two parts",
      "Evaluated response includes one heart emoji (💙) while the ground truth uses no emojis"
