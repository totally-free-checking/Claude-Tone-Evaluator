    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points, maintaining a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation using relatable teen language like 'totally steamrolled' and acknowledging 'you're not wrong for being upset'",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice including exact scripts ('I know you were trying to help...') and realistic compromise strategies"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person narrator voice characteristic of Claude (no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it'), using impersonal constructions like 'you could say' instead",
      "Slightly more solution-heavy than the ground truth, which leaves more space for the teen to share before offering detailed advice"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format with warm, immediate validation and zero bullet points, creating a conversational text-like feel",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses first-person inclusive language ('from our perspective') while evaluated response lacks first-person narrator voice entirely, making it feel slightly less personal",
      "Ground truth asks two separate questions about the situation and communication status; evaluated response asks one compound question about the activity content",
      "Evaluated response provides specific scripts and boundary-setting strategies, while ground truth is more exploratory and validates without prescribing specific phrasing"
