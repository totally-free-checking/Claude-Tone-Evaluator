      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think') creating a personal, supportive connection",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly longer than necessary - the 'silver lining' paragraph adds length without as much value as the rest",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the ground truth doesn't and the character typically avoids them unless asked"

    "most_claude_like": "The immediate emotional validation combined with first-person perspective ('I totally get why that would feel annoying') perfectly captures the supportive older sibling vibe",

      "Evaluated response provides specific scripted language for talking to mom, while ground truth keeps advice more general",
      "Evaluated response is roughly twice as long with 4 paragraphs vs ground truth's 2 paragraphs",
      "Evaluated response includes one emoji while ground truth uses none",
      "Evaluated response uses more explicit first-person language ('I think', 'I get') compared to ground truth's slightly more detached 'It's understandable'"
