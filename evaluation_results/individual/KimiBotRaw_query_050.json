    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and relatable language ('Ugh, that's genuinely the worst,' 'stomach-drop moment,' 'death glare') that immediately connects with the teen's feelings",
      "Provides excellent specific, actionable advice with realistic scripts ('Hey, I'll take the research section, you want to handle the slides?' and specific teacher conversation starter)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers and structured sections ('**First things first:**', '**The Business Transaction Approach**') breaks the conversational flow - Claude writes in natural prose paragraphs without headers",
      "Lacks first-person language throughout ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') - the response uses an impersonal instructional tone rather than speaking as a supportive friend sharing their perspective",
      "Opens with interrogative questions under a bold header rather than ending with a natural conversational question to continue the dialogue"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation 'Ugh, that's genuinely the worst' perfectly captures Claude's warm, casual, empathetic tone that immediately makes the teen feel understood",
    "least_claude_like": "The over-formatting with bold section headers ('**First things first:**', '**The Nuclear Option**') transforms the response from a conversational text into a structured self-help article, which is the opposite of Claude's natural prose approach",

      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "While not using traditional bullet points, the response relies heavily on bold headers to separate sections, creating a structured, formatted appearance that reads like a wikiHow article rather than a flowing conversation. Claude's ground truth uses zero headers and minimal formatting."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses bold headers and structured sections instead of natural prose flow with minimal formatting",
      "Places questions at the beginning under headers rather than naturally throughout and at the end",
      "Lacks first-person perspective ('I think,' 'I'd say') using instead an impersonal instructional 'you' voice",
      "More advice-heavy structure with labeled strategies vs. Claude's balanced validation-advice-validation flow"
