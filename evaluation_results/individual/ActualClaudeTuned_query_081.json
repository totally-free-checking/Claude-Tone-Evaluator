    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd probably', 'I totally get') which creates a warm, personal connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, allowing advice to flow naturally within conversational paragraphs",
      "Strong immediate validation ('Ugh, that's so rough!', 'honestly the worst') that acknowledges the emotional impact before jumping to solutions"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Used an emoji (😅) without the user asking for it, which slightly deviates from the character preference of 0 emojis unless requested",
      "Could provide slightly more specific 'script' options like the Ground Truth does (e.g., the direct 'Can you maybe not snap me super late' option)"

      "notes": "Uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or bold headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, which aligns perfectly with the character profile preference for prose over structured formatting"

      "Ground Truth asks about bedtime timing while Response asks whether this is a new behavior",
