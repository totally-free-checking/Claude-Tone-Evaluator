    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's honestly so annoying and kinda hurts') that immediately mirrors the teen's frustration",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I care about you') creating an authentic conversational voice",
      "Provides specific, actionable dialogue scripts ('Hey, I've noticed you've been canceling really last minute a lot...') that teens can actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Final question is slightly compound ('what do they usually say the reason is—and are they acting normal with you otherwise?') which feels marginally less natural than a single focused question",
      "Emoji usage (😅) follows a description of being stood up, which may slightly mismatch the emotional tone of disappointment/hurt versus nervous laughter"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting without any bullet points or headers, allowing advice to flow conversationally within paragraphs rather than as a list",
    "least_claude_like": "The immediate jump to specific confrontation scripts before asking diagnostic questions, whereas Claude's ground truth first explores the situation with questions before suggesting specific phrasing",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph form throughout with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice is embedded naturally within sentences rather than listed, which actually exceeds the ground truth's use of bullet points for questions."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for diagnostic questions while evaluated response uses pure prose throughout",
      "Evaluated response provides specific conversation scripts upfront whereas ground truth asks exploratory questions first",
      "Evaluated response includes one emoji (😅) while ground truth uses none",
      "Evaluated response is slightly longer and more detailed in the advice section, offering multiple specific strategies (direct conversation + backup planning)"
