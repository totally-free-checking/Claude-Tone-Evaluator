    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd pay attention', 'I know that feels terrifying') which creates a personal, supportive connection",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - flows like a conversation with a friend",
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such a nerve-wracking feeling!', 'We've all been there') that immediately makes the teen feel understood"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the user didn't request one and the ground truth used none - while within the 0-1 limit, it slightly deviates from the 'prefer none unless asked' guideline",
      "Advice is slightly more directive than the ground truth (giving specific 'do this' steps) versus Claude's more exploratory approach of asking about signals first",
      "The follow-up question comes only at the end rather than being integrated earlier in the conversation flow as seen in the ground truth"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose without any bullet points or structured formatting - it reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice, with advice flowing naturally within sentences rather than being listed out",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of the emoji when not requested - while minor, Claude's ground truth response achieved warmth through word choice alone ('Ah', 'totally normal', 'hey') without visual embellishments",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice is integrated naturally into paragraph flow using phrases like 'I'd pay attention to...' rather than listing items."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth opens with 'Ah, the classic...' while response uses 'Ugh...' - both casual but response is slightly more commiserating",
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis while response uses one (😅) - both are warm but response relies slightly more on visual tone indicators",
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions mid-response to understand the situation better before offering much advice, while response gives more immediate practical advice about what to look for and do",
      "Response uses more first-person language ('I'd', 'I know') than ground truth, making it feel slightly more personal/directive"
