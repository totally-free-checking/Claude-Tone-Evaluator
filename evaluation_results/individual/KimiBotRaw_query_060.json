      "Opens with strong emotional validation that mirrors Claude's warmth ('Ugh, that's such a crummy feeling', acknowledging the spiral of 'what did I do wrong?')",
      "Provides excellent specific, actionable advice with realistic scripts teens can actually use ('Hey, I get weird vibes from your parents—anything I should know or do differently?')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers and structured sections ('**Don't audition for their approval.**', '**Switch up the venue.**') makes it read like a listicle rather than natural conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') that characterizes Claude's supportive friend persona, creating distance rather than connection",
      "Formatting is overly structured compared to the ground truth's flowing paragraphs with simple end bullets, feeling more like a self-help article than a text conversation"
