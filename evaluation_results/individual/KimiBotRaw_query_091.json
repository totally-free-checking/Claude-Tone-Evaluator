    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('That really sucks to think about,' 'gut-punch') that immediately acknowledges the hurt",
      "Ends with a natural, specific follow-up question that invites the teen to share more context ('Has this been going on for a while...')",
      "Uses appropriate casual teen language ('hitting you up,' 'bail') without sounding forced or cringe"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a formatted bullet list with bold headers ('The solo test,' 'The conversation balance') which breaks the conversational prose flow that Claude maintains",
      "Suggests 'quietly pull back' as a primary strategy whereas Claude's approach focuses more on direct communication or figuring out feelings first",
      "Slightly longer and more structured than Claude's typical 2-3 short paragraph responses, making it feel more like an article than a text conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that immediately names the emotional experience ('gut-punch') and the natural follow-up question at the end that shows genuine curiosity about the specific situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The bulleted list with bold headers formatting the advice into three distinct tests - Claude would weave these observations into natural prose paragraphs instead of structuring them as a checklist",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "72%",
      "notes": "Response contains a distinct 3-item bulleted list with bold headers (The solo test, The conversation balance, Your energy). This is a major deviation from Claude's prose-only approach. The list breaks the conversational flow and makes the advice feel more like a self-help article than a supportive chat."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses pure prose throughout while the evaluated response uses a structured bullet list for advice",
      "Ground truth focuses on validating the feeling of being a 'stepping stone' and asks about addressing it directly, while the evaluated response provides diagnostic 'tests' and suggests pulling back quietly as an option",
      "Ground truth is more concise (3 short paragraphs) while the evaluated response is longer with more structured sections and multiple question sets"
