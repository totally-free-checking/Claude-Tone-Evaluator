    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points - reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd focus', 'I'm here' implied through tone) making it feel personal and authentic",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen could use ('Hey, I noticed [specific thing] - how did that make you feel?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Question comes only at the end rather than interspersed throughout like the ground truth, making it slightly less conversational",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the user didn't request one and the ground truth uses none, though it's within acceptable limits",
      "Slightly heavier on advice compared to the ground truth, which focused more on asking questions first to understand the situation better"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose flow and first-person perspective ('I think the best thing you can do', 'I'd focus on still being a good friend') perfectly captures the supportive friend/sibling vibe",
    "least_claude_like": "The structural choice to give advice before asking questions, whereas Claude typically asks exploratory questions earlier to show curiosity about the specific situation before offering solutions",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions immediately in the second sentence; evaluated response saves the question for the end after giving advice",
      "Ground truth uses no emojis; evaluated response includes one (😅)",
      "Ground truth focuses primarily on validation and information-gathering; evaluated response provides more immediate concrete advice and scripts",
      "Ground truth asks multiple specific questions about the friend's behavior and relationship dynamics; evaluated response asks one compound question at the end"
