    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation opening with 'Oh man, that's such a gut-punch feeling' that immediately acknowledges the difficulty of the situation",
      "Strong natural first-person language throughout ('I've gotta be honest','I care about you','I'm feeling') that creates genuine connection",
      "Specific, realistic conversation scripts that give teens actual words to use in difficult confrontations"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet-point formatting in the 'A couple things to keep in mind' section (using dashes) rather than flowing prose paragraphs",
      "Over-use of inline bold formatting (**not**) and structural headers that feels more like an article than a text conversation",
      "Slightly over-explains each approach with lengthy descriptions rather than Claude's more concise, trust-in-the-user style"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that uses casual, empathetic language ('gut-punch','alarm bell','Super uncomfortable') to immediately make the teen feel understood",
    "least_claude_like": "The bulleted list at the end ('A couple things to keep in mind') with three dash-points - Claude would write these as natural prose sentences or integrate them into the conversation flow rather than listing them out",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "While the three approach sections use bold headers similar to the ground truth, the addition of a separate bulleted list with dashes for 'things to keep in mind' pushes this into over-structured territory. The ground truth integrates these types of reminders into flowing paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses a bulleted list format for additional advice rather than integrating points into prose paragraphs",
      "Ends with one compound question instead of two separate follow-up questions that keep conversation flowing",
      "More verbose explanations after each suggested approach compared to Claude's concise presentation of options"
