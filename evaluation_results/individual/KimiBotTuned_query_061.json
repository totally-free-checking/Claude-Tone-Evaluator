      "Excellent natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and smooth conversational flow throughout",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice tailored to teen social dynamics (e.g., 'This reminded me of you lol', suggesting casual hangouts)",
      "Strong warm opening that immediately validates the confusing feelings with relatable language ('that feeling is so real', 'make your brain go in circles')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language like 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' that Claude uses to feel more personal and supportive",
      "Heavier focus on tactical solutions compared to Claude's more exploratory, validation-first approach",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) which Claude typically avoids unless specifically requested"

      "Ground truth focuses on exploring feelings and uncertainty with open-ended curiosity, while evaluated response jumps to concrete strategies for testing interest",
      "Ground truth uses no emojis and relies on words for warmth ('Ah', 'totally'), while evaluated response uses one emoji and slightly more casual slang ('Aww yeah')",
      "Ground truth emphasizes that 'everyone expresses interest differently' and normalizes confusion, while evaluated response focuses more on interpreting specific behavioral signals"
