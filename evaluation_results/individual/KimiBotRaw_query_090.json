    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold formatting ('**Some casual tips**', '- **Pick a calm moment.**') which breaks the conversational prose flow",
      "Over-structuring with bold headers and formatted lists makes it feel more like an article than a text conversation",
