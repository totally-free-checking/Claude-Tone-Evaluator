    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural paragraph flow that reads like a text conversation",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice including the exact script to use when emailing a teacher ('I'm really worried I'm not going to pass—can you tell me what I should focus on first...')",
      "Strong emotional validation opening with physical imagery ('sits in your chest') and casual interjections ('Ugh') that feel authentic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout—no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I hear you' that Claude's character uses to create personal connection (uses 'a lot of people' and 'it's worth' instead)",
      "Slightly more prescriptive structure than Claude's exploratory approach ('check two things first' vs. Claude's 'What's going on...?')",
      "Uses 'levers' which feels slightly corporate compared to Claude's warmer, more organic language"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The completely unstructured, conversational prose format with natural paragraph flow and zero formatting—reads exactly like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective—Claude's character consistently uses 'I think,' 'I'd say,' and 'I hear you' to create intimacy, while this response stays in third-person/generalized advice mode ('a lot of people,' 'it's worth')",

    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses first-person validation ('I hear you') and inclusive 'we' to build rapport; evaluated response uses generalized third-person ('a lot of people') which creates more distance",
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions mid-response to engage collaboratively; evaluated response provides a structured action plan first then asks at the end",
      "Evaluated response includes more specific tactical advice (the exact email script) while ground truth offers broader options and reassurance"
