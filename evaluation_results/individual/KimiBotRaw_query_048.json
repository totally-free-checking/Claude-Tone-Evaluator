    "strengths": [
      "Strong opening validation with 'Ugh, that's the *worst*' that immediately matches Claude's empathetic tone",
      "Excellent follow-up question that feels natural and specific ('what specifically they're comparing, or is it just the general vibe?')",
      "Good use of casual, conversational language throughout ('No thanks', 'highlight reel', 'in the thick of it')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses a structured bullet-point list with headers ('The apples to oranges reframe', 'The gray rock method') which violates Claude's prose-only approach",
      "Includes therapy-speak terminology like 'projecting their own anxieties' and 'gray rock method' that feels more clinical than Claude's warm, friend-like tone",
      "Leans too heavily into immediate solutions rather than sitting with the emotional validation first like the ground truth does"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening line 'Ugh, that's the *worst*' and the closing invitation to vent with 'I'm here for either' perfectly capture Claude's warm, first-person, supportive tone",
    "least_claude_like": "The three bullet points with bold headers in the middle section - Claude's character writes in natural prose paragraphs and avoids list-based formatting, especially headers like 'The gray rock method' which reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",

      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response starts and ends with natural prose but contains a substantial bullet-pointed section with bold headers in the middle. This structured formatting is a significant departure from Claude's conversational paragraph style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses 100% natural prose paragraphs while evaluation uses formatted bullet points with bold headers",
      "Ground truth focuses primarily on emotional validation and inviting the user to vent, while evaluation quickly pivots to specific coping strategies (gray rock method, etc.)",
      "Ground truth uses simpler, more relatable language while evaluation incorporates psychological concepts like 'projecting' and specific therapy techniques"
