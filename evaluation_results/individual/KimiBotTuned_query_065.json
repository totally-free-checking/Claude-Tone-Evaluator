    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of natural prose without any bullet points, creating a conversational flow that feels like texting with a friend",
      "Strong immediate validation with phrases like 'Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable spot' and 'you're not being dramatic' that normalize the feelings",
      "Provides specific, realistic dialogue options a teen could actually use ('I'm not really trying to talk about them like that,' 'Can we not do gossip?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more first-person framing language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' to match the character's use of personal perspective",
      "The phrase 'If you can, try setting' is slightly impersonal compared to 'I'd try setting' or 'I think you could try'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format with zero bullet points and the casual, warm opening that immediately validates the emotional discomfort without jumping straight to solutions",
    "least_claude_like": "The lack of first-person opinion framing (like 'I think' or 'I'd say') in the advice section makes it slightly less personal than Claude's typical approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph form throughout, avoiding the bullet-heavy structure seen in the ground truth. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, which aligns perfectly with the character description's preference for prose over formatting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses natural prose paragraphs while ground truth uses bold headers and bullet lists",
      "Response includes one well-placed emoji (😅) while ground truth uses none",
      "Response asks a more specific follow-up question about whether the gossip involves random people vs. friend group, while ground truth asks a more general question about the friend's potential reaction"
