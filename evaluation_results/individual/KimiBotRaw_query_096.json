      "Excellent emotional validation with relatable metaphors ('like you're watching a movie of other people having fun while you're standing right there in the room')",
      "Strong conversational first-person language ('I know it sounds basic,' 'I'd say') that feels authentic and warm",
      "Specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (the 'one real conversation' trick, checking hunger/tiredness)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points with bold headers instead of natural prose paragraphs, which breaks the conversational flow characteristic of Claude's style",
      "Does not end with a question to continue the conversation (ground truth ends with 'What do you think...' while this ends with a statement and emoji)",
      "Over-structures advice with formatting ('Try the “one real conversation” trick':) rather than flowing it into natural sentences"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and conversational tone - 'Ugh, that's such a weird, lonely feeling' immediately validates the emotion with casual, empathetic language that sounds like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-pointed list format with bold headers (e.g., '**Try the “one real conversation” trick**') - Claude's ground truth uses pure prose paragraphs without any bullet formatting or bold text",

      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "Response uses three distinct bullet points with bold headers to present advice, which is a major structural deviation from Claude's prose-only approach. The bullets create a 'listicle' feel rather than a natural conversation."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses exclusively prose paragraphs while evaluated response uses formatted bullet points with bold text",
      "Ground truth ends with an engaging question ('What do you think might be contributing...') while evaluated response ends with a validation statement and emoji",
      "Ground truth clusters questions together in the middle and ends with one question; evaluated response integrates questions earlier and ends with statements"
