    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd probably') which makes it feel like a real person texting",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or excessive formatting - reads like a conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen could actually use ('Hey, I noticed my [whatever item] got pretty damaged...')",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging question about the item and damage level that invites continuation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Jumps to practical advice faster than Claude's ground truth, which spends more time exploring the situation first with questions",
      "Slightly longer and more solution-heavy than typical Claude teen responses, which tend to be shorter and more exploratory/validation-focused before offering strategies",
      "Could use more immediate emotional validation at the very start before transitioning to 'Honestly, most good friends...'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose with first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') and casual contractions that sound like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The structure prioritizes giving advice over asking exploratory questions - Claude's ground truth asks questions throughout and waits to understand the situation before offering solutions, while this response gives a full action plan before asking follow-ups",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being structured as steps."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses entirely on exploratory questions and validation without giving advice yet; evaluated response provides specific advice scripts and action steps",
      "Ground truth is very brief (2 short paragraphs) while evaluated response is more substantial (3 paragraphs with detailed advice)",
      "Ground truth asks multiple questions early in the response; evaluated response saves questions for the end",
      "Ground truth uses more emotional imagery ('sinking feeling'); evaluated response uses more practical/logical framing"
