    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation",
      "Provides extremely specific and actionable texting scripts ('lol anywayy', 'wait I just remembered ___') that teens can actually use",
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('such a gut-punch', 'brain instantly start replaying everything') that captures the spiraling feeling perfectly"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') that Claude uses to feel more personal and supportive - only uses 'I'm so sorry' once",
      "Slightly more formal phrasing in places ('depending on when you sent it', 'interrupts the spiral') compared to Claude's casual 'Oof' and 'Life happened'",
      "Could use more of Claude's reassuring 'you're not alone' type validation before jumping to the 'here's what to do' section"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format without any bullet points or headers - it reads like a continuous supportive text message rather than a structured advice list",
    "least_claude_like": "The lack of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I totally get') makes it feel slightly less personal and connected than Claude's approach, which consistently uses 'I' statements to build rapport",

      "notes": "Perfectly formatted as natural prose paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. This actually exceeds the ground truth response, which used 5 bullet points for the list of reasons someone might not respond."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for listing reasons (distraction/busy/bad at texting), while response integrates these ideas into flowing prose",
      "Response provides specific text message templates the user can copy/paste, whereas ground truth gives more general advice about not staring at phone",
      "Response uses one heart emoji (💙) while ground truth uses zero emojis",
      "Response asks about timeframe ('how long has it been') while ground truth asks about content only ('What did you message them about')"
