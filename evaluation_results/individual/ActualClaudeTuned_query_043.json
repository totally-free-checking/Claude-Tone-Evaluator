      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'm here', 'I get the sense') which creates genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's such a tough spot' and 'nothing worse than that nagging feeling' that acknowledges the emotional weight"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Used an emoji (😅) without the user asking for one, though it was appropriately placed and only one",
      "Could have included slightly more specific 'easy out' phrasing options like the ground truth does, though the prose examples given are good"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose flow that embeds specific conversation starters into flowing text rather than listing them as bullet points - this matches the character profile's emphasis on 'NOT bullet-heavy' formatting and conversational flow",

      "notes": "Response uses pure conversational paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or bold formatting.

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bold headers and bullet-point formatting for three conversation approaches ('The soft opener:', 'Give them an easy out:', 'Direct but kind:'), while evaluated response integrates these naturally into prose paragraphs",
      "Ground truth asks two follow-up questions at the end, while evaluated response asks one natural question",
      "Ground truth uses no emojis, while evaluated response uses one (😅)",
      "Evaluated response uses more casual interjections ('Ugh', 'super accusatory') compared to ground truth's slightly more structured tone"
