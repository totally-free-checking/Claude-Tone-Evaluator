      "Opens with immediate first-person validation ('Ugh, I'm so sorry') that acknowledges the specific 'post-test panic' feeling",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Could use more explicit first-person language in the advice section (e.g., 'I'd suggest' or 'I think you should') rather than implied first-person",
