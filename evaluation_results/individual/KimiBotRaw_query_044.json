    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Oh no, that stomach-drop feeling is THE WORST!' which captures the empathetic tone well",
      "Specific, realistic advice that's actually actionable for a teen (asking for a second to think, the water sip technique)",
      "Good use of casual, age-appropriate language without being cringe ('Super annoying', 'totally normal')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points with bold headers ('The honest pause', 'The strategic sip') which breaks the conversational flow - Claude uses pure prose",
      "Missing follow-up question entirely - Claude always ends with a natural question to continue the conversation",
      "Lacks first-person reflective language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') that makes Claude's responses feel personal and friend-like",
      "Over-explains the biology ('your body sometimes floods with adrenaline') which feels more clinical than Claude's simple 'poof - completely empty' description"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that immediately normalizes the experience with 'this happens to *everyone*' and reassurance that these moments feel bigger than they are",
    "least_claude_like": "The formatted bullet point list giving advice - Claude never uses bullet points or bold headers, instead weaving advice naturally into conversational prose paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 2,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "Response uses two distinct bullet points with bold headers ('The honest pause', 'The strategic sip'), which is a major deviation from Claude's prose-only approach. The advice itself is good but the formatting makes it feel like a self-help article rather than a text conversation."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses 100% natural prose paragraphs while evaluation uses structured bullet points with bold text",
      "Ground truth ends with an engaging follow-up question ('Did you manage to say anything...') while evaluation has no question",
      "Ground truth uses first-person perspective ('Sometimes I think teachers forget...') while evaluation is more impersonal/explanatory",
      "Ground truth focuses more on emotional validation and reassurance that it'll blow over, while evaluation shifts quickly to practical tips presented in list format"
