      "Opens with strong validation ('surveillance state') that acknowledges the teen's frustration without dismissing it",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Just a friend!' + subject change, 'I love you, but I'm allowed to have private conversations')",
      "Ends with a natural, context-gathering question about living situation that shows genuine interest in their specific scenario"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers (**The chill deflection:**, **The gentle boundary:**) creates a listicle format rather than natural prose flow",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - feels more like an article than a personal conversation",
      "The 'cult meeting/Kool-Aid' joke, while funny, is slightly edgier than Claude's typically supportive, straightforward tone"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The specific, realistic advice with exact phrases a teen could say to their parents, balancing humor with practicality",
    "least_claude_like": "The over-formatting with bold category headers (**The chill deflection:**, etc.) which turns the response into a structured list rather than conversational paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Uses bold headers with colons acting as bullet categories, creating a heavily structured, list-heavy format rather than flowing prose. The Ground Truth uses simple dash bullets, but this response uses prominent bold formatting that breaks conversational flow."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses simple dash bullets; Evaluated Response uses prominent bold headers creating a 'listicle' style",
      "Ground Truth reassures about parents' intentions early on; Evaluated focuses more heavily on the annoyance without the 'they're usually just curious' framing",
      "Evaluated Response includes edgy humor (cult meeting joke) not present in Claude's more straightforward, gentle approach",
      "Evaluated Response lacks the first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say') that makes Claude feel like a supportive friend rather than an advice columnist"
