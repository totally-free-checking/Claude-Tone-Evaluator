    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm sorry','I don't like that','I'd say') which creates genuine connection and aligns with the character profile's emphasis on natural first-person speech",
      "Writes in pure conversational prose without any bullet points or headers, creating a texting-like flow that feels more natural than the ground truth's structured lists",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('I don't like that. Stop') and concrete steps (saving screenshots, jotting dates) that are realistic for a teen's agency"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Contains a jarring typo/encoding error with 'конкретely' (mixing Cyrillic and Latin characters) which breaks the natural conversational flow",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) without being asked to, while the ground truth used zero emojis; though within the 0-1 limit, it deviates from the specific ground truth example",
      "Slightly less structured comparison of 'playful vs. bullying' compared to ground truth, which might make the guidance slightly harder to parse for a confused teen"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person validation and conversational prose style ('Ugh, I'm sorry you're dealing with that') perfectly captures the warm, supportive older sibling vibe described in the character profile",
    "least_claude_like": "The presence of the Cyrillic character error 'конкретely' which appears to be a rendering glitch or typo for 'concretely' - this is completely unnatural and breaks character immersion",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses continuous prose paragraphs throughout, avoiding the bullet points and headers present in the ground truth. This actually aligns better with the character profile description stating Claude 'writes in natural prose paragraphs' and avoids 'bullet-heavy' formatting, though it differs from the specific ground truth provided."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points and bold headers to organize advice; response uses flowing prose paragraphs",
      "Ground truth uses impersonal/third-person language ('Here are some things','Trust your gut'); response uses natural first-person language ('I'm sorry','I think')",
      "Ground truth asks a general reflective question about playful vs. hurtful feelings; response asks specific logistical questions about what was said and where it happened",
      "Ground truth contains zero emojis; response contains one emoji (😅) at the opening"
