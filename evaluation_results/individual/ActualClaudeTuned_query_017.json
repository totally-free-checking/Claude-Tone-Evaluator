    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get why you're feeling unsure', 'I think it might help', 'I'd probably just') which creates authentic connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable situation!') that acknowledges the awkwardness of the situation",
      "Natural prose flow without any bullet points or over-formatting - reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Specific, nuanced follow-up question that distinguishes between awkwardness and genuine concern for the friend's safety"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Provides more prescriptive advice ('give it a little more time', 'keep being a good friend and staying observant') before asking questions, whereas Claude typically asks exploratory questions first to understand the situation better",
      "Slightly longer and more detailed than Claude's typically concise, punchy responses (Ground Truth is 2 short paragraphs vs 3 medium paragraphs here)",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) which, while acceptable within guidelines, differs from the Ground Truth's clean no-emoji approach"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational voice using first-person perspective ('Trust me, I get why you're feeling unsure', 'Honestly, your gut instincts...') perfectly captures the supportive friend/sibling dynamic",
    "least_claude_like": "The structure of giving substantial observational advice before asking questions - Claude's Ground Truth jumps immediately to questions ('Can you tell me a bit more...') after brief validation, keeping the response more open-ended and exploratory",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or lists. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being structured as actionable steps"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth asks exploratory questions immediately after brief validation; Response to Evaluate provides observational advice first then asks questions at the end",
      "Ground Truth is significantly more concise (roughly half the length) with tighter, punchier sentences",
      "Ground Truth uses no emojis while Response uses one (😅), though this is within acceptable character guidelines"
