      "Opens with immediate, relatable validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's so frustrating!') that mirrors how a friend would react",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the ground truth doesn't and the user didn't request emojis, slightly deviating from the preferred 0-emoji approach",
      "Jumps directly to advice ('I'd maybe try having a calm conversation') rather than first asking if they've attempted communication like the ground truth does",
      "Includes 'ride it out' messaging which is slightly less proactive than the ground truth's focus on opening dialogue"

      "Ground truth asks 'Have you been able to talk to them' before offering advice, while this response jumps straight to suggesting how to talk",

      "Ground truth focuses on external stressors (work, news, anxiety about growing up); this adds the interpretation that parents might be trying to be 'better parents' by being stricter"
