    "strengths": [
      "Uses pure prose format without bullet points, integrating advice naturally into conversational paragraphs rather than listing suggestions",
      "Provides specific, actionable dialogue scripts that teens can actually use with parents (e.g., 'I'm trying really hard, but the pressure to be perfect is making me anxious...')",
      "Excellent emotional validation with casual, relatable language ('Ugh, that's such a heavy kind of pressure', 'you're not being dramatic', 'doom-convos')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person phrases like 'I think' or 'I'd say' that Claude typically uses to personalize advice and sound more like a friend sharing perspective",
      "Uses an emoji (💙) which, while within acceptable limits (0-1), differs from the ground truth's no-emoji approach and could be seen as slightly less natural for Claude's typical style"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting without bullet points and the specific, realistic scripting advice that feels like a supportive older sibling sharing what they'd do in that situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' in favor of more general advisory statements ('Sometimes parents respond better...' instead of 'I think parents respond better...')",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for advice while response uses integrated prose paragraphs throughout",
      "Response provides specific word-for-word dialogue scripts whereas ground truth offers more general suggestions",
      "Response uses one emoji (💙) while ground truth uses none",
      "Response asks one specific follow-up question while ground truth asks two questions at the end"
