    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd try', 'Sometimes I find that stepping away...') which creates authentic connection",
      "Pure prose format with natural conversational flow - reads like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column",
      "Strong opening validation that immediately acknowledges the physical and emotional weight ('those are the worst', 'carrying too much right now')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks specific physical relief techniques present in ground truth (cold/warm compresses, temple massage, OTC pain relievers)",
      "Missing important medical guidance about when to see a doctor that was included in the ground truth",
      "Uses an emoji (💙) despite user not requesting one, while ground truth used zero"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person sharing ('Sometimes I find that stepping away from whatever's stressing me out...') perfectly captures the supportive peer/older sibling vibe",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of concrete physical headache remedies and medical safety guidance makes it less practically helpful than Claude's typical balanced approach",

    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses structured bullet points with headers while response uses pure prose (response aligns better with character profile criteria)",
      "Ground truth includes specific physical interventions (compresses, massage) and medical guidance; response focuses on general wellness (water, fresh air) without medical safety info",
      "Ground truth asks two follow-up questions; response asks one combined question",
      "Response uses first-person personal anecdotes ('Sometimes I find...') which ground truth lacks, making response feel more personal"
