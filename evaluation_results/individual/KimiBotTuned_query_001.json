    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose with zero bullet points - flows like a conversation with a friend",
      "Uses casual, authentic teen-appropriate language like 'kinda,' 'weirdly well,' and 'honestly though' without trying too hard",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to say ('Yeah… rough morning,' 'It’s my new fashion era') and tactical tips (tucking feet under desk)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question focuses on the shoe details rather than the teen's broader wellbeing; ground truth asks 'How's the rest of your day going' which shows more personal care",
      "Slightly less immediately optimistic than ground truth; focuses more on the embarrassment ('embarrassingly relatable') before reassurance compared to ground truth's immediate 'The good news is' framing",
      "Missing the warm closing sentiment or 'I'm here' type language that signals ongoing support"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow - it reads exactly like a text message from a supportive friend with no corporate formatting or bullet points",
    "least_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end focuses narrowly on the shoe similarity rather than opening up to the teen's broader emotional state or day; Claude typically ends with broader questions that show care for the person, not just the problem details",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks about shoe similarity at the beginning and ends with a broad personal check-in ('How's the rest of your day going'), while the response asks about shoes at the end, keeping the focus narrow",
      "Response provides more tactical/hiding advice ('keep your feet tucked under your desk') while ground truth focuses more on attitude and owning the moment with humor",
      "Ground truth uses 'The good news is' framing to immediately pivot to reassurance, while response validates the embarrassment longer before offering the 'people barely pay attention' reassurance"
