    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'm so sorry', 'I think once you get there') creating a personal, supportive connection that feels like a real friend",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, allowing advice to flow naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than feeling like a checklist",
      "Natural follow-up question at the end that specifically addresses the teen's potential concerns about opening up vs. worrying about the counselor's response"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Doesn't explicitly mention confidentiality concerns, which is a common and important teen worry that the ground truth specifically addresses",
      "Lacks the explicit encouraging closing statement (like 'You've got this!') that Claude typically uses to validate the teen's courage in considering this step"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person conversational tone using phrases like 'I think' and 'Honestly' that make it feel like a supportive friend texting rather than an impersonal advisor, combined with the pure prose format",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of explicit confidentiality reassurance, which is a key practical concern for teens talking to school counselors that Claude's ground truth response specifically includes",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure prose format with no bullet points, actually exceeding the ground truth which used 4 bullet points. Advice is seamlessly integrated into conversational paragraphs like 'You could even start by just saying...'"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses 4 bullet points for practical advice while evaluated response uses pure prose paragraphs throughout",
      "Ground truth specifically mentions confidentiality concerns whereas evaluated response focuses on general nervousness and opening up to someone new",
      "Ground truth places questions in the middle and end, while evaluated response saves the question for the end only",
      "Ground truth ends with explicit encouragement ('You've got this!') while evaluated response ends with the question"
