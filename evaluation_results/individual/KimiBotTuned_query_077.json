    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual, relatable language ('Ugh, that's such a heavy spot') that acknowledges the physical feeling of anxiety",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I care about you too much', 'I'd rather do it with you') creating a personal, supportive presence rather than detached advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use word-for-word, making the advice immediately practical"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question, while good, packs multiple concepts (safety vs. mistake vs. illegal vs. relationship) into one sentence which could feel slightly overwhelming compared to a simpler question",
      "Could potentially use one emoji early on to match the '0-1 max' warm tone guideline, though zero is also acceptable"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting without any bullet points or lists, flowing as a continuous conversation with validation leading naturally into advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The slight over-packing of the final question with multiple categories (illegal/relationship-type) where Claude might use a simpler, more open-ended follow-up",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent use of pure prose paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or structured lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being itemized, creating a conversational text-message feel"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses 3 bullet points for advice while Response uses flowing prose paragraphs, making Response more aligned with the character's preferred writing style",
      "Response provides specific word-for-word scripts to say ('I care about you too much to keep this secret...') whereas Ground Truth gives more general guidance",
      "Response uses more first-person language ('I'd rather', 'I care') creating a more personal connection compared to Ground Truth's more observational tone"
