    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get it', 'I'd say', 'I think') which creates authentic connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like natural conversation",
      "Specific, realistic advice for teens ('smile back or even say hi') rather than generic platitudes",
      "Engaging, situation-specific follow-up question about the type of smile that shows genuine curiosity"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly less playful/enthusiastic emotional validation compared to ground truth (missing the 'Oh no, you've entered the spiral' energy)",
      "Leans slightly more toward advice-giving than emotional exploration - could use more acknowledgment of how overwhelming the feelings are"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format and consistent first-person perspective ('I'd say', 'I think') that makes it feel like texting with a supportive friend rather than reading a self-help article",
    "least_claude_like": "The slightly more analytical/advisory tone compared to the ground truth's focus on simply validating the overthinking experience and encouraging enjoyment of the moment",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Excellent - response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth emphasizes acknowledging the 'detective brain' and enjoying the moment more; response focuses more on interpreting the smile and concrete next steps",
      "Ground truth asks about the types of thoughts they're having; response asks about the nature of the smile itself",
      "Response uses 'Honestly' which shifts slightly toward advice-giving mode rather than pure empathy"
