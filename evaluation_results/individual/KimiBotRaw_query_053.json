    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation that mirrors Claude's exact language ('Ugh, that's so frustrating!') and acknowledges the specific disappointment of last-minute cancellations",
      "Provides genuinely practical, teen-appropriate advice including specific conversation scripts ('Can we figure out a system that works better?') and realistic strategies like the 'buffer' approach",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that shows interest in the specific context ('Have they always been like this, or is it new behavior?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold formatting ('They might be overwhelmed', 'The honest conversation') makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversational text from a friend",
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') that makes Claude's responses feel personal and supportive; uses impersonal analytical tone instead ('Some people...', 'Harsh truth...')",
      "Jumps quickly from brief validation into structured problem-solving mode with headers ('A few thoughts on what might be going on:', 'What you could try:') rather than staying in emotional support mode"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' perfectly captures Claude's warm, immediate emotional acknowledgment and casual tone",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy bullet-point structure with bold headers categorizing advice into 'The honest conversation', 'Lower-stakes plans', and 'The buffer' - this reads like a wikiHow article rather than natural prose",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "20%",
      "notes": "Response uses bullet points for both analysis ('They might be overwhelmed') and advice ('What you could try:'), with bold text formatting throughout. This is the opposite of Claude's approach which uses flowing paragraphs with advice embedded naturally in sentences"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses natural prose paragraphs throughout while evaluated response uses heavy bullet formatting and bold headers",
      "Ground truth uses first-person language ('I think', 'It sounds like') and conversational warmth throughout, while evaluated response is impersonal and analytical",
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions within the flow of conversation, while evaluated response provides categorized lists of reasons and solutions",
      "Ground truth maintains emotional validation throughout ('your time matters too'), while evaluated response shifts quickly to diagnostic/problem-solving mode"
