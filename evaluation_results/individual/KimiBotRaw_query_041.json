      "Excellent specific and actionable advice tailored to the situation (gas station protein boxes, splitting DoorDash, desk drawer stash)",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers (**The gas station special**, etc.) contradicts Claude's prose-only conversational style",
      "Lacks the immediate, expressive emotional validation that Claude provides ('Ugh, that's such a bummer!')",

      "Uses bullet points with bold headers instead of natural prose flow for presenting options",
      "Opens with calmer validation rather than Claude's immediate empathetic exclamation ('Ugh, that's such a bummer!')",
      "Missing the warm emoji usage (😅) that adds to Claude's casual, friendly tone"
