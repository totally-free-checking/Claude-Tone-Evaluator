    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a friend",
      "Strong visceral emotional validation using physical descriptors like 'makes your stomach twist' and 'gross feeling' that deeply acknowledge the teen's distress",
      "Provides a specific, word-for-word script the teen can use ('I understand why this looks suspicious...') which is immediately actionable and reduces anxiety about what to say"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person opinion framing language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' that Claude uses to establish personal connection; relies on 'Honestly' instead of 'I think'",
      "Combines two distinct questions into one long question at the end rather than separating them or asking one focused follow-up",
      "Could balance the validation-to-advice ratio slightly better—the advice section is quite long compared to the emotional validation section"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The pure prose formatting without any bullet points or headers, which aligns perfectly with the character's texting-like conversational style (unlike the ground truth which used bullet points)",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person subjective language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') in the bot's own voice; the response feels slightly more prescriptive than the warm, personal advisory tone Claude typically uses",

      "notes": "Response uses three natural paragraphs with advice embedded in flowing sentences rather than lists, which is actually more aligned with the character profile description than the bullet-heavy ground truth"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses pure prose while ground truth uses bullet points under headers (Talk to your teacher, Gather evidence, Know your options)",
      "Response provides specific dialogue scripts the teen can quote verbatim, while ground truth gives more general action categories",
      "Response uses more visceral, physical emotional language ('stomach twist') compared to ground truth's calmer cognitive validation ('totally makes sense that you'd be stressed')"
