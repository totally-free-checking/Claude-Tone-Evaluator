    "strengths": [
      "Opens with relatable validation ('I know that loop well') and casual language that matches the teen voice",
      "Uses first-person language naturally ('I know that loop well') and creates a conversational feel in the opening paragraph",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice like the '5% weight' concept and 'change the channel' technique that feels realistic for teens"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bullet points and bold headers ('**To stop the spiral:**') which breaks the prose-only format Claude maintains",
      "Completely missing the follow-up question at the end - Claude nearly always ends with a specific question to continue the conversation",
      "The 'Zapruder film' reference feels slightly out of place and dated for a teen support context, unlike Claude's more universal 'detective' metaphor"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening paragraph's casual, validating tone using first-person language ('Oh man, the *smile spiral*. I know that loop well') captures the warm, empathetic voice well",
    "least_claude_like": "The structured bullet-point list with bold formatting under a header - Claude writes in natural prose paragraphs without list formatting or headers",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Response shifts from prose to a structured list format with bold headers and bullet points for advice, which is a major divergence from Claude's conversational paragraph style. The bullets make it feel more like a self-help article than a text conversation."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses pure prose throughout while evaluation uses bullet points and bold headers for the advice section",
      "Ground truth ends with an engaging specific question ('What kind of thoughts are ping-ponging around in your head?') while evaluation ends with a statement ('You're gonna be okay, detective')",
      "Ground truth focuses more on emotional validation and enjoying the moment, while evaluation focuses more on cognitive techniques and 'managing' the crush"
