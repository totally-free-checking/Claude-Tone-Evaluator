    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose flow with zero bullet points or formatting artifacts - reads exactly like a text conversation",
      "Strong first-person language usage ('I'm happy to just listen', 'I can help you') that creates personal connection",
      "Specific, actionable offers that give the teen real choices (venting, brainstorming, or letting it go)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Ends with two questions connected by 'And' which feels slightly less natural than a single flowing question or separate paragraphs",
      "Slightly less immediate emotional acknowledgment than ground truth - 'Ugh' is good but 'Oh no' plus validation feels warmer",
      "Could use more varied first-person phrases like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to match Claude's typical voice patterns"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose formatting is perfect - conversational paragraphs with no lists, headers, or over-structuring, flowing naturally like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_claude_like": "The double question at the end ('What kind of situation... And did they realize...') feels slightly more interrogative than the ground truth's gentler, spaced-out questioning approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, lists, or excessive formatting. Uses italics for emphasis (*worst*) which is natural and acceptable in prose context."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses one emoji (💙) while evaluated uses zero - both are valid per character instructions (0-1 max)",
      "Ground truth separates questions into different sentences/paragraphs while evaluated combines them with 'And'",
      "Evaluated offers more specific practical pathways (vent, brainstorm, let go) compared to ground truth's more open-ended approach",
      "Evaluated uses idiom 'in the doghouse' which is slightly more colloquial than ground truth's phrasing"
