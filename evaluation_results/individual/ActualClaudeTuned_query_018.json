    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language that creates genuine connection ('Sometimes I think it helps to just text a friend')",
      "Perfect prose formatting without any bullet points, allowing advice to flow naturally within conversational paragraphs",
      "Strong immediate validation that acknowledges the helplessness of the situation ('it's the worst feeling when you're stuck listening... and there's nothing you can do')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing the immediate 'Are you doing okay?' check-in that the ground truth includes, which adds an extra layer of emotional safety",
      "Slightly more prescriptive than the ground truth by including the suggestion to talk to parents/counselors, whereas the ground truth focuses purely on immediate coping and validation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format that avoids all bullet points and headers, instead weaving practical advice ('put on some music or a show with headphones') seamlessly into supportive paragraphs that feel like texting with a caring friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of the blue heart emoji (💙), while within acceptable limits (0-1), differs from the ground truth's emoji-free approach and could be seen as slightly less natural for Claude's typically understated emotional expression",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format throughout, integrating all advice into natural sentences rather than listing them. This actually exceeds the ground truth, which uses a bulleted list for practical suggestions."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for advice while response uses pure prose paragraphs",
      "Response includes first-person perspective ('Sometimes I think') which ground truth lacks",
      "Response suggests talking to parents/counselors as a follow-up option, which ground truth omits",
      "Ground truth asks two questions at the end while response asks one focused question",
      "Response uses one emoji (💙) while ground truth uses none"
