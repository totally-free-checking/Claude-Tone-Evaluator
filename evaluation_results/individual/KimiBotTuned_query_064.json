    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('that 'oh no, where is it' panic hits so hard') that immediately normalizes the teen's stress",
      "Provides excellent specific, actionable advice grounded in realistic school scenarios ('wrong pocket, buried in a binder, turned in with a worksheet')",
      "Maintains natural prose throughout without resorting to bullet points or over-formatting"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Shifts away from first-person language in the middle section (uses 'try to rewind' and 'check the spots' instead of 'I'd suggest retracing' or 'I usually check'), making it feel less personal than Claude's typical 'I think'/'I'd say' approach",
      "Significantly longer and more detailed than Claude's concise, breezy style - the advice section is dense compared to the ground truth's light touch",
      "Lacks the collaborative 'we can figure this out together' framing that makes Claude's responses feel like a supportive partnership"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate emotional validation and warm, casual opening that acknowledges the panic without dismissing it",
    "least_claude_like": "The length and density of the practical advice section - Claude typically keeps advice brief and conversational rather than comprehensive",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph format with no bullet points or headers. Uses comma-separated lists within sentences (e.g., 'wrong pocket, buried in a binder') which is natural and conversational, not formatted as structural bullets."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth is much more concise (2 short paragraphs vs 3 substantial ones) and asks the follow-up question immediately rather than after lengthy advice",
      "Ground truth uses collaborative first-person plural language ('we can figure this out together', 'let's just think') while the response shifts to second-person imperative instructions",
      "Ground truth validates first, offers minimal practical advice, then re-engages; the response provides extensive step-by-step guidance that dominates the response"
