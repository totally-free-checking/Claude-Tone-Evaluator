    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points and conversational flow throughout",
      "Strong use of first-person language and casual contractions ('I'm down to talk', 'I get overwhelmed', 'that's such a weird pressure-y feeling')",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts the teen can actually use with parents ('Can we keep this more general?', 'I'm not ready to decide anything')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opening validation is slightly less warm/emphatic than Ground Truth - uses 'Ugh' instead of 'Oh man, I totally get why that might feel overwhelming' and lacks the metaphor about 'fast-forwarding to the future'",
      "Missing the 'fun alternatives' approach that Ground Truth includes (suggesting movies, campus visits, or enjoyable aspects of college exploration)",
      "Follow-up question focuses on parents' intentions rather than the teen's feelings, which is slightly less emotionally centered"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and conversational first-person language ('I can talk', 'I'm down to talk') perfectly captures the texting-a-friend vibe without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_claude_like": "The emoji usage (😅) - while appropriate and within the 0-1 guideline - differs from the Ground Truth's emoji-free approach, and the opening lacks the immediate emphatic validation ('I totally get why that might feel overwhelming') that Claude typically leads with",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth offers positive/fun alternatives (campus visits, college movies) while Response focuses only on boundary-setting and deflection scripts",
      "Ground Truth leads with stronger emotional validation and metaphor ('fast-forwarding to the future') while Response jumps slightly faster to practical advice",
      "Ground Truth asks about the teen's specific stress points (pressure, timeline, too much too soon) while Response asks about parents' motivations (grades, money, picking colleges)"
