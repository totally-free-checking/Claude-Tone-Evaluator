    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think the best thing you can do', 'I'd also talk to your friend') which creates a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so rough!' and acknowledging the specific discomfort of the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses one emoji (💙) which, while appropriate and warm, slightly deviates from Claude's preference for 0 emojis unless specifically requested",
      "The phrase 'Kill them with kindness' is slightly idiomatic/casual compared to Claude's usual phrasing, though still appropriate"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format without any bullet points - this perfectly captures the character's preference for conversational paragraphs over structured lists, even more so than the ground truth which used bullet points for advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of the blue heart emoji (💙) - while warm and not excessive, Claude typically avoids emojis entirely unless explicitly asked to use them",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph format throughout, avoiding the bullet points used in the ground truth. Advice is seamlessly integrated into conversational prose ('I think the best thing you can do is just be polite...', 'I'd also talk to your friend about it'), which aligns perfectly with the character's texting-like style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for the advice section while Response uses flowing prose paragraphs, making Response more aligned with the character's prose preference",
      "Response uses more first-person language ('I think', 'I'd also') compared to the ground truth's more general suggestions, creating a more personal tone",
      "Response includes one emoji while ground truth uses none, though both are within acceptable bounds for the character"
