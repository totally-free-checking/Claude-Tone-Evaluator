    "strengths": [
      "Excellent immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst!' that mirrors Claude's empathetic opening style",
      "Strong use of first-person language throughout ('I think,' 'I get why,' 'I'd say') creating authentic conversational flow",
      "Specific, teen-appropriate advice (listening to music, going for a walk) that's actionable without being overwhelming"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly more solution-focused than the ground truth, which spent more time purely validating before moving to the question",
      "The emoji choice (😅) conveys a slightly different energy than the ground truth's frustrated 😤, though still appropriate"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose flow with zero bullet points and seamless integration of validation with first-person perspective ('I get why that would make you even more frustrated')",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of specific coping strategies (music, walking) makes it slightly more advice-heavy than the ground truth's pure validation-and-vent approach, though still well within character",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no lists, headers, or over-structuring. Maintains conversational paragraph flow throughout."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses a hiccup analogy to illustrate the counterproductive nature of 'calm down' while evaluated response explains it directly",
      "Ground truth focuses entirely on validation and venting without specific coping suggestions, while evaluated includes concrete decompression activities",
      "Ground truth places emoji at the end for emphasis while evaluated places it early in the opening line"
