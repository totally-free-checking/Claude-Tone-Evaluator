    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Oh no', 'uniquely awful about being trapped') that immediately acknowledges the awkwardness",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts like 'This is awkward, huh? Hope you're doing okay' that teens can actually use",
      "Ends with an engaging, context-specific follow-up question about duration (wedding vs. plane) that invites continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers and structured sections (**The 'Professional Acquaintance' approach**) which creates a list-like, article format rather than natural conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel more like an advice column than a supportive friend texting",
      "Presents advice immediately after brief validation rather than asking exploratory questions first, unlike the ground truth"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that uses casual language ('social horror movie scenario') and the specific follow-up question about whether it's a temporary seating situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and structured formatting to present options, which reads like a self-help article rather than natural text message conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "While not using traditional bullet points, the response relies on bold headers (**The 'Professional Acquaintance' approach**, etc.) that function as list items, creating a structured, formatted appearance rather than flowing prose. The ground truth uses simple dash bullets but keeps them brief and conversational, whereas this response's bold headers create a more formal, segmented structure."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks clarifying questions before offering advice, while this response jumps straight into structured solutions",
      "Ground truth uses minimal formatting (simple dashes) while this uses bold headers and section labels that over-structure the response",
      "Ground truth maintains a continuous conversational flow throughout, while this response shifts into an 'advice article' mode with labeled strategies"
