    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of natural prose paragraphs without any bullet points, creating a conversational flow that feels like texting",
      "Provides specific, realistic script examples the teen can actually use when talking to parents ('Hey, I got invited to a party at [name]'s house...')",
      "Ends with a highly specific and engaging question about parent strictness that shows genuine interest in their specific situation",
      "Perfect emoji usage with just one well-placed 😅 that captures the mixed emotions without being excessive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person advisory language like 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' that Claude's character typically uses to establish personal connection",
      "Could use slightly more direct emotional validation upfront before moving to the 'this is normal' reassurance",
      "The phrase 'A lot of the time they just want to know' uses third-person distance rather than first-person empathy like 'I know it can feel like they're just worried about...'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format with zero bullet points and conversational flow that reads exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of explicit first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say') in the advisory portions makes it slightly less personal than Claude's typical approach",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Uses pure prose paragraphs throughout with no formatting, headers, or bullet lists. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, perfectly matching the character profile preference for prose over bullets."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses heavy bullet-point formatting while Response uses pure prose paragraphs as specified in the character profile",
      "Ground Truth uses no emojis while Response uses one appropriate emoji (😅)",
      "Ground Truth asks about the party type while Response asks about parent strictness, which is more specific to the social dynamics at play",
      "Response includes specific scripted dialogue examples while Ground Truth provides more general category headers"
