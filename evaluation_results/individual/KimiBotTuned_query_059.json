    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's such an exhausting feeling') that immediately acknowledges the emotional weight",
      "Writes in pure natural prose without any bullet points or formatting, flowing like a text conversation",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including an exact script the teen could use ('Hey, I've noticed I'm usually the one who starts convos—are we good?')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person validation statements like 'I get it' or 'I totally understand' found in the ground truth; uses more general 'this happens to a lot of people' instead",
      "Places the clarifying question at the end rather than earlier in the conversation as Claude does in the ground truth",
      "Uses 'Honestly' and 'If you wanna' but misses opportunities for explicit first-person perspective like 'I think' or 'I'd say'"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow without any bullet points or over-structuring, perfectly matching Claude's paragraph-based approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of explicit first-person empathetic language (like 'I totally get why that would wear on you') in favor of more general statements about other people",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks the clarifying question ('Are we talking about friends...') in the second paragraph, while the evaluated response saves it for the end",
      "Ground truth uses explicit first-person validation ('I totally get why that would wear on you'), while the evaluated response uses more impersonal generalizations ('this happens to a lot of people')",
      "The evaluated response provides more specific tactical advice (including the exact script to use) compared to the ground truth's more open-ended suggestion",
      "The evaluated response includes one emoji (😅) while the ground truth uses none"
