    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation: 'That’s a heavy spot to be in, and it’s totally normal to feel like you’re fumbling for the right thing to say'",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use like 'Do you want to vent, or do you want help problem-solving? I can do either'",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout ('I’m here', 'I care about you so much', 'I can do either') creating personal connection",
      "Ends with a thoughtful, specific follow-up question that checks on the helper's wellbeing: 'How are you feeling about all this?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavily over-formatted with bold headers (**Just be a listener, not a fixer**) and extensive bullet lists that read like a self-help guide rather than conversational prose",
      "Uses structured sections with formatting throughout instead of natural flowing paragraphs - feels more like a wikiHow article than texting a friend",
      "Length is overwhelming with multiple dense bullet lists that could be condensed into warmer, flowing text",
      "The phrase 'Here’s the low-pressure way to show up:' followed by headers feels instructional rather than conversational"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The combination of immediate emotional validation with extremely practical, realistic advice including specific phrases the teen can say word-for-word, plus the natural use of first-person supportive language",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy reliance on bold text, bullet points, and structured formatting rather than natural prose paragraphs - it prioritizes organization over the conversational, texting-like flow that defines the character",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 16,
      "prose_percentage": "15%",
      "notes": "Response is dominated by bullet formatting with bold section headers (**Just be a listener...**, **Check in gently...**, etc.) and extensive bulleted dialogue suggestions. Only the opening sentence and final paragraph are in pure prose. This heavily structured approach contradicts the 'natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)' requirement."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses lighter bullet formatting while Response uses heavy bold headers and extensive bullet lists that dominate the text structure",
      "Response includes detailed suicide prevention/safety advice which Ground Truth only briefly mentions under a general 'If it seems serious' section",
      "Response emphasizes self-care for the helper ('take care of yourself too', 'set boundaries') while Ground Truth focuses primarily on supporting the friend",
      "Response asks about the user's own feelings at the end, while Ground Truth asks for details about the friend's specific struggles to give better advice"
