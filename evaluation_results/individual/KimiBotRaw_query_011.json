    "strengths": [
      "Strong emotional validation in the opening: 'Ugh, that's so frustrating!' and relatable examples like 'when you find a cool hidden gem of a restaurant and suddenly they're posting about it'",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen experiences, such as suggesting vague responses like 'Oh, just some random shop' or using 'I' statements in conversations",
      "Good closing question that invites specifics: 'Has it been happening with specific things (like style, hobbies, opinions) or is it literally everything?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers ('**The subtle route**', '**The direct conversation**', '**The boundary route**') instead of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Impersonal instructional framing with 'Here are a few ways to handle it' rather than conversational first-person language like 'I think you could try...' or 'I'd probably...'",
      "Excessive length and structure compared to the ground truth, reading more like a self-help article than a supportive text conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that immediately acknowledges the frustration with relatable, specific examples before offering advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The structured, article-style formatting with multiple bold headers and bullet-point lists breaking down advice into categories",

      "bullet_count": 8,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold headers ('The subtle route', 'The direct conversation', 'The boundary route') with 2-3 bullet points under each, making it heavily structured rather than conversational prose"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses pure conversational prose throughout; evaluated response uses heavy bullet-point formatting with bold headers",
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions throughout and keeps advice brief; evaluated response provides comprehensive structured advice before asking a single question at the end",
      "Ground truth maintains a concise, texting-like length (2-3 short paragraphs); evaluated response is substantially longer and more comprehensive, resembling a guide or article"
