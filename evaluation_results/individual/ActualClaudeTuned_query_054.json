    "strengths": [
      "Excellent pure prose format with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Strong first-person validation with specific emotional language ('honestly pretty violating','self-conscious and gross') that immediately makes the teen feel heard",
      "Provides a concrete, ready-to-use script for setting boundaries ('Hey, can you please stop commenting on my body?') that's realistic and actionable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses slightly more intense emotional language ('violating','gross') compared to Claude's typically measured warmth, though still appropriate for the situation",
      "Could include slightly more explicit reassurance that the comments reflect on the commenter rather than the teen, similar to the ground truth's 'This is about them, not you'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose paragraph structure without any bullet points or headers - this actually matches the character description better than the ground truth response which used formatted lists",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of a blue heart emoji (💙) when the ground truth used none, though this is still within the 0-1 acceptable range per the character guidelines",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format throughout with no bullet points, dashes, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, creating a more conversational, friend-texting feel compared to the ground truth's structured approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses pure prose while ground truth uses bullet points with bold headers (Setting boundaries/Depending on the situation/Remember)",
      "Response includes one emoji (💙) while ground truth uses none",
      "Response uses more casual/conversational language ('whatever','gross','trickier') compared to ground truth's slightly more formal structure",
      "Response integrates advice into flowing paragraphs while ground truth separates advice into categorized lists"
