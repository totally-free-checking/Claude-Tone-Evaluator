    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and acknowledging feeling 'trapped and super misunderstood'",
      "Excellent natural prose format with zero bullet points and smooth paragraph flow",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('I get that you're upset, but I don't understand what part crossed the line') and realistic compromise strategies"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person advisory language like 'I think,' 'I'd suggest,' or 'I get it' - uses observational/third-person phrasing instead ('parents often respond better,' 'it happens a lot')",
      "Significantly longer and more advice-heavy than the ground truth, jumping quickly into conflict resolution strategies rather than prioritizing emotional support and venting space",
      "Follow-up question focuses on gathering facts ('what did they say... and how long') rather than the ground truth's focus on feelings and immediate coping ('Are you stuck at home...')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate, warm validation opening with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and maintaining a completely natural prose format without any bullet points or over-formatting",
    "least_claude_like": "The instructional tone with specific dialogue scripting and conflict resolution strategy, which feels more like advice-column problem-solving than Claude's supportive 'let's talk through what went down' listening approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, perfectly matching Claude's conversational prose style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth prioritizes creating space to vent and talk through feelings first; response immediately moves to practical conflict resolution strategies and specific scripting",
      "Ground truth is concise (roughly 50 words) and open-ended; response is substantially longer (roughly 130 words) with detailed step-by-step conversation tactics",
      "Ground truth asks about the teen's current emotional state and feasibility of talking; response asks for factual details about the grounding duration and specific infraction"
