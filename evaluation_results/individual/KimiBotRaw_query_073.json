    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that's so exhausting!') that mirrors Claude's empathetic entry point",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice with exact phrases the teen can use ('Hey, I'm not trying to compete with you—I'm just sharing')",
      "Ends with natural, engaging follow-up questions that invite further conversation, closely matching the ground truth's approach"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Over-formatted with bold headers (**Don't play the game**, **Call it out gently**, etc.) that function as heavy bullet points, breaking the conversational prose flow",
      "Significantly longer than necessary - the ground truth is concise and phone-readable while this response rambles with excessive psychological analysis",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the ground truth uses none and the character prefers zero unless specifically asked"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and empathetic acknowledgment of how exhausting competitive friends can be, using casual language like 'Suffering Olympics' and 'Yikes, that sucks'",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold headers and structured formatting (**Don't play the game**, **Call it out gently**, etc.) which reads more like a self-help article than a texting conversation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Uses 4 prominent bold headers that function as bullet points with explanatory text underneath, creating a structured list format rather than natural flowing prose. Ground truth uses simple dash bullets without headers."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses simple prose with minimal bullet points; response uses heavy bold headers and over-formatting",
      "Response is approximately 2x longer than ground truth with unnecessary psychological analysis about why people are competitive",
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis; response uses one emoji",
      "Ground truth offers 3 concise bullet points; response offers 4 bold-header sections with lengthy explanations"
