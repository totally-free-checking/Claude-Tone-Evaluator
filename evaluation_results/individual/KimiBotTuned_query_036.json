    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with relatable language ('Ugh, that's such a gross, knot-in-your-stomach situation', 'you're not being dramatic')",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing to use ('Hey, I've been feeling kind of worried because I've noticed they ___') and realistic safety guidance",
      "Natural, conversational follow-up question that specifically references the user's situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - uses impersonal constructions ('it usually goes best', 'it's okay to loop in') instead of Claude's characteristic 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it'",
      "Advice delivery is more directive and structured compared to Claude's exploratory, open-ended approach that prioritizes curiosity over prescriptive solutions"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that immediately normalizes the teen's feelings with casual, empathetic language ('Ugh', 'knot-in-your-stomach', 'you're not being dramatic')",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete absence of first-person perspective and natural self-reference (no 'I think', 'I'd suggest', or 'I totally get it'), making the advice feel more like general guidance than personal support from a friend",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely in prose paragraphs with no bullet points or numbered lists; however, the second paragraph contains dense, structured advice with example dialogue in quotes and a parenthetical list of abusive behaviors (controlling, isolating, threatening, etc.) that creates a slightly list-like feel within the prose"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses consistent first-person language ('I totally get', 'I care', 'I understand') to create personal connection; evaluated response uses entirely impersonal/general constructions",
      "Ground truth focuses primarily on exploratory questions and emotional validation with minimal advice; evaluated response provides substantial prescriptive advice including safety protocols and specific scripts",
      "Ground truth maintains a lighter, more questioning tone throughout; evaluated response shifts quickly to directive problem-solving mode"
