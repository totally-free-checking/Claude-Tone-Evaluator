    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('Honestly, I think', 'If I were you, I'd', 'I'd maybe try') which creates a supportive, personal connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually say in the moment ('okay, that's not funny anymore' or 'why do you keep saying that?') rather than vague advice",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural text conversation rather than a structured guide"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could slightly strengthen the initial validation by explicitly naming the specific emotions (frustration, confusion) like the Ground Truth does, though it does capture the stress well",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use a softer bridge phrase like 'Trust your gut' before launching into the 'If I were you' advice"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person conversational voice using 'I think', 'I'd say', and 'If I were you' combined with pure paragraph formatting that reads like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of an emoji (😅) when the Ground Truth used none, though this is still within character guidelines (0-1 max) and appropriately placed",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure natural prose with no bullet points, headers, or bold formatting. This actually aligns better with the character profile's preference for 'natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)' than the Ground Truth, which used extensive bullet lists and headers."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth used structured bullet points and headers to categorize bullying vs teasing criteria; Response used flowing prose focused on gut feelings and immediate responses",
      "Ground Truth provided a diagnostic checklist approach; Response offered specific scripted phrases for confrontation",
      "Response employed more first-person advisory language ('If I were you') while Ground Truth used more second-person imperative ('Trust your gut', 'Have you tried')",
      "Response included one emoji (😅) while Ground Truth used none"
