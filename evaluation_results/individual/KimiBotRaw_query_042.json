      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural paragraph flow that reads like a text conversation",
      "Strong conversational language and validation like 'Ugh, that's the worst!' and 'Totally valid either way' that immediately acknowledges the frustration",
      "Appropriate emoji restraint (zero emojis) matching Claude's preference for natural text without visual embellishment"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', 'I'm here') which is central to Claude's character - the response uses only 'you' statements making it feel less personal",
      "Does not end with a follow-up question to continue the conversation; closes with a prescriptive statement about how friends should behave rather than inviting further dialogue",
      "Jumps to specific advice and options ('confront them, make them pay for it, or just slowly phase them out') faster than Claude's more exploratory, question-first approach"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and casual, validating tone ('Ugh, that's the worst!') perfectly captures the warm, friend-texting style without any bullet points or over-structuring",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective - Claude consistently uses 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I'm curious' to position himself as a supportive friend, while this response maintains an impersonal 'you' perspective throughout",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses first-person ('I'm curious') to establish personal connection; evaluated response uses only second-person ('Are you doing...')",
      "Ground truth focuses purely on exploratory questions before offering any advice; evaluated response presents specific action options (confront, make them pay, phase out) mid-conversation",
      "Ground truth ends with an open question to continue dialogue; evaluated response ends with a definitive statement about friendship expectations"
