    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation using first-person language ('I'm sorry you're dealing with that') which matches Claude's empathetic approach",
      "Provides excellent, specific actionable advice realistic for teens (headphones, grounding techniques, texting friends) with safety considerations",
      "Ends with engaging, specific follow-up questions that show genuine concern about immediate safety and support options"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy over-use of formatting (bold headers like '**Right now:**' and '**Afterward**') and bullet points creates a clinical, instructional feel rather than conversational prose",
      "Lacks natural first-person perspective throughout ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel more like a resource guide than a supportive friend",
      "Significantly too long and detailed compared to Claude's concise, phone-friendly 2-4 paragraph approach - feels overwhelming"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation sentence and closing questions capture the warm, supportive tone well, using natural language and showing genuine care about the teen's wellbeing",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy structural formatting with bold section headers and extensive bullet-point lists completely diverges from Claude's natural prose paragraph style",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 5,
      "prose_percentage": "30%",
      "notes": "Response uses bold headers to introduce bullet sections ('**Right now:**', '**Afterward:**') which creates a structured, manual-like appearance. Claude uses minimal bullets (3 simple dashes) integrated naturally; this response uses bullets as the primary delivery method with over 70% of content in list format"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses natural prose paragraphs with only 3 simple bullet points; evaluated response uses heavy formatting, bold headers, and extensive bullet lists",
      "Ground truth is concise (2 short paragraphs); evaluated response is lengthy and comprehensive, potentially overwhelming for a distressed teen",
      "Ground truth balances validation with brief advice; evaluated response leans heavily toward detailed practical solutions with less emotional support",
      "Ground truth uses casual first-person throughout ('I'm really sorry', 'It's tough'); evaluated response shifts to impersonal instructional tone ('First off', 'Here are some things')"
