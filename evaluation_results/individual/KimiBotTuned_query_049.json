    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural paragraph flow throughout",
      "Appropriate single emoji usage (😅) that matches the ground truth's warm, casual tone",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging question about whether the smile felt general or personal, showing genuine interest",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice realistic for a teen (smiling back, saying 'hey', observing their reaction)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Complete absence of first-person language ('I think', 'I get it', 'I'd say') makes it feel impersonal compared to Claude's conversational, friend-like approach",
      "Opens with 'Aww wait' which is slightly less warm/empathetic than Claude's 'Oh no, you've entered the classic overthinking spiral!' that immediately validates the emotional experience",
      "Lacks the 'we're in this together' validation that Claude provides with phrases like 'I totally get it though'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting without any bullet points or over-structuring, maintaining a conversational flow throughout",
    "least_claude_like": "The complete lack of first-person perspective - the response never uses 'I' statements (e.g., 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which is central to Claude's character voice",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely in natural prose paragraphs with no bullet points, headers, or bold text, matching Claude's preferred formatting style perfectly"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses first-person language throughout ('I totally get it', 'I know') to create personal connection; evaluated response uses only second-person ('you') creating distance",
      "Ground truth asks about the types of thoughts the user is having; evaluated response asks about the nature of the smile itself",
      "Ground truth includes more explicit emotional validation about enjoying the moment; evaluated response moves more quickly to analytical advice"
