      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I get why you're upset', 'I'd maybe wait', 'I think') which creates genuine connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual, relatable language ('Ugh, that's so frustrating') matching the ground truth's empathetic approach",
      "Writes in natural flowing prose without any bullet points or over-formatting, reading like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Includes an emoji (😅) when the ground truth uses none and the character profile specifies not to use emojis unless explicitly asked",
      "Jumps to practical advice in paragraph 3 whereas the ground truth focuses on exploratory questions first before offering solutions",
      "Ends with a compound question ('What did they ground you for, and how long...') rather than the ground truth's approach of asking one focused question early and another at the end"

      "Ground truth uses 0 emojis while evaluated uses 1 (😅)",
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions before giving advice; evaluated provides specific advice ('wait until things cool down', 'ask them to explain') in the middle before asking questions",
      "Ground truth asks two separate questions at different points; evaluated asks one compound question at the end",
      "Ground truth is slightly more concise and exploratory; evaluated is more solution-forward"
