    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person empathetic language that immediately validates feelings ('Ugh, I'm so sorry you're dealing with that,' 'you're not being dramatic for hating it')",
      "Pure prose format with natural conversational flow - reads like a supportive friend texting rather than a structured advice column",
      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use ('Don't comment on my body,' 'Stop. That's not okay') and realistic next steps (tracking incidents, involving trusted adults)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could benefit from slightly more first-person opinion phrasing like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to match Claude's characteristic voice (though 'Honestly' helps)",
      "The intensity of language ('skin crawl,' 'picked apart') fits the situation but is slightly more visceral than Claude's typically measured warmth"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting without any bullet points or headers - it flows as continuous conversational text that balances validation with practical steps, exactly matching the character's preference for paragraph-based responses over structured lists.",
    "least_claude_like": "The slightly more intense emotional descriptors ('skin crawl,' 'gross') compared to Claude's typically calmer empathetic tone, though this is a minor deviation and still appropriate for the topic.",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. This actually exceeds the Ground Truth response (which used bullet points under headers) and perfectly aligns with the character profile's preference for natural prose over formatting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses bullet points under section headers ('Setting boundaries:', 'Depending on the situation:') while Response uses pure flowing prose throughout",
      "Response includes specific mention of online/social media contexts ('If it's online, blocking and reporting') which Ground Truth omits",
      "Response uses more casual, visceral teen language ('skin crawl,' 'mess with your whole day,' 'gross') compared to Ground Truth's slightly more formal tone",
      "Response asks about three specific contexts (school, home, online) while Ground Truth asks about workplace/school and closeness of relationship"
