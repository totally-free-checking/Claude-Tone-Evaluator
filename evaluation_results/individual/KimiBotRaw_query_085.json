    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong empathetic validation ('Ugh, that sounds *exhausting*') and uses relatable metaphors ('referee in a game nobody asked you to play')",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (gray rock technique, 'getting water' escape, slow fade strategy, specific script for boundaries)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers and section structuring ('**Is it possible to gray rock it?**', '**Can you break off into smaller groups?**') creates a list/article format instead of natural prose conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel more impersonal and advisory rather than like a supportive friend",
      "Jumps quickly into solutions without the exploratory questioning that Claude uses to understand the situation first"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The casual, validating opening line 'Ugh, that sounds *exhausting*' captures the warm, empathetic tone perfectly, and the advice about the 'slow fade' and specific phrases to use shows good understanding of teen social dynamics",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy reliance on bold headers and structured sections (four separate bolded questions/headers) transforms what should be a conversational text into a formatted self-help article, completely violating Claude's prose-only approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 4,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Uses four bold headers acting as section titles ('**Is it possible to gray rock it?**', etc.) which function as disguised bullet points, creating a structured list format rather than flowing paragraphs. The remaining text is organized under these headers rather than flowing naturally."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude asks exploratory questions immediately to understand the situation before giving advice; this response gives extensive advice first and asks only at the end",
      "Ground truth uses pure conversational paragraphs with zero formatting; evaluated response uses bold headers and section breaks creating a listicle structure",
      "Claude uses first-person language throughout ('you shouldn't have to feel stuck', 'I'm here'); this response uses impersonal second-person directives ('You could try', 'You end up feeling')",
      "Ground truth is concise (2-3 short paragraphs); this response is substantially longer with detailed multi-part advice"
