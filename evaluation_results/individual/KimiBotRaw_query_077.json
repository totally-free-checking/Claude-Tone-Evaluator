      "Opens with strong validation: 'That’s a heavy spot to be in. It’s totally normal to feel conflicted—or even anxious' acknowledges the emotional weight immediately",

      "Heavy formatting with bold headers (**1. Check your own capacity**, **2. Define the 'serious'**) makes it read like a self-help article rather than a conversation",
