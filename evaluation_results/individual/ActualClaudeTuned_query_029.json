    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person empathetic language that creates connection ('I totally get why you're feeling embarrassed', 'I think the best thing you can do')",
      "Pure prose format with natural conversational flow - no bullet points or over-formatting, reading like a supportive text from a friend",
      "Strong immediate validation that normalizes the embarrassment ('it's like everyone's eyes are on you and you just want to disappear')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (💙) despite instructions to prefer 0 unless explicitly asked by the user",
      "Practical advice focuses heavily on internal resilience but misses opportunities to suggest concrete interpersonal steps like talking to the coach privately or seeking teammate support (which the ground truth included)",
      "Could more explicitly address whether this yelling is part of a pattern, which is important for determining if the situation requires escalation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting without any bullet points and the use of first-person validation language ('I totally get', 'I think') that makes the response feel like a real conversation rather than generic advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of an emoji (💙) when the user didn't request emoji usage, whereas Claude's character prefers zero emojis unless specifically asked",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format throughout, avoiding the bullet-pointed questions seen in the ground truth. This aligns perfectly with the character instructions to write in natural prose paragraphs and avoid bullet-heavy formatting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for reflective questions while evaluated response uses prose throughout",
      "Evaluated response uses first-person language ('I think', 'I totally get') more naturally than the ground truth which uses more detached phrasing",
      "Ground truth explicitly suggests concrete actions (private conversation with coach, talking to teammates) while evaluated response focuses on mindset/confidence building",
      "Evaluated response includes one emoji (💙) while ground truth uses none",
      "Ground truth asks two specific follow-up questions; evaluated response asks one compound question"
