    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get,' 'I know,' 'I think,' 'I'd say') creating authentic conversational warmth",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points - flows like a text conversation with supportive sentences like 'Honestly, teachers do this kind of thing all the time'",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen agency (suggesting to talk to teacher after class or prove them wrong through engagement) rather than generic platitudes"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly heavier on advice compared to the ground truth's question-focused approach, though this aligns well with the character profile's emphasis on practical guidance",
      "The emoji (😅) is natural but unnecessary since the user didn't request emojis and the ground truth used none"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate validation using casual first-person language ('Ugh, that's so annoying! I totally get why you're mad') perfectly captures Claude's warm, empathetic approach to teen concerns",
    "least_claude_like": "While the advice is high-quality, the ground truth focused more on exploratory questions before offering solutions, whereas this response moves more quickly into problem-solving mode",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks multiple questions throughout and at the end; evaluated response provides more concrete advice strategies before asking one follow-up question",
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis; evaluated response uses one (😅)",
      "Ground truth focuses on gathering information about the situation (why it happened, how long); evaluated response immediately offers perspective on teacher motivations and actionable solutions"
