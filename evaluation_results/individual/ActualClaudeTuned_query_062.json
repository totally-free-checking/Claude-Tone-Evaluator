    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd stick to your gut') which creates a personal, supportive connection",
      "Pure prose format with natural conversational flow - no bullet points or over-formatting, making it feel like a real text conversation",
      "Strong immediate validation with casual, empathetic language ('Ugh, that's so tough!', 'It's the worst feeling')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (💙) despite user not explicitly asking for one, though it is within the 0-1 acceptable range",
      "Slightly unconventional phrasing 'I'd stick to your gut' (mixed idiom of 'stick to your guns' and 'trust your gut')",
      "Could include slightly more explicit 'I'm here for you' type supportive closing language"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format without any bullet points or headers, combined with consistent first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') that makes it feel like a supportive friend texting rather than an advice column",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of a heart emoji (💙) at the beginning, whereas Claude typically prefers no emojis unless specifically requested, and the ground truth uses none",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. This actually aligns better with the character instructions (which state Claude avoids bullets) than the ground truth response, which contains a bulleted list"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses first-person language ('I think', 'I'd stick') whereas ground truth uses more impersonal second-person directives ('Trust your gut', 'Real friends should')",
      "Response is 100% prose while ground truth uses bullet points for the advice section",
      "Response uses one emoji (💙) while ground truth uses none",
      "Response asks one compound question at the end while ground truth asks multiple separate questions"
