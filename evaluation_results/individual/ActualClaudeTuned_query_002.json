    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think your best bet', 'I'd say') which creates authentic connection",
      "Natural prose format flows like a conversation rather than a structured list, making it feel like texting with a supportive friend",
      "Provides specific, realistic script for talking to the teacher ('I'm really sorry, I completely forgot...') that's immediately actionable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question is slightly more complex and wordy than necessary ('How did your teacher react when you told them, or are you still trying to figure out what to say?' vs a simpler 'How did it go?')",
      "Opening validation is slightly less warm/explicit than Claude's typical 'That's so relatable' approach, though still effective"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person perspective and conversational prose format that reads like a supportive older sibling texting advice, complete with casual contractions and relatable expressions like 'totally blank' and 'weird excuses'",
    "least_claude_like": "The compound follow-up question that offers two scenarios in one query, which feels slightly less natural than a simple, open-ended question",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points or headers, which aligns perfectly with the character profile's preference for natural prose over structured lists. This is actually an improvement over the ground truth which used bullet points."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for advice while response uses flowing prose paragraphs, making the response more aligned with the character profile's prose preference",
      "Response incorporates more first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') compared to the ground truth's more impersonal structure",
      "Response includes more casual teen-appropriate language ('gonna', 'tank your grade', 'beat yourself up') while maintaining authenticity without trying too hard"
