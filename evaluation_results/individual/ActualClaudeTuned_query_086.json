      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I promise', 'I know') creating genuine connection",

      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling!' and acknowledging the urge to disappear"

    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is slightly more direct ('What exactly happened') compared to Claude's gentler 'if you don't mind me asking' approach",
      "Adds specific advice about using humor which, while helpful, wasn't in the ground truth and slightly shifts the balance toward solutions",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the ground truth used zero, though this is within acceptable bounds"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose flow with conversational first-person validation - it genuinely sounds like a supportive friend texting rather than an AI giving advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The slightly more directive tone in the advice section (suggesting specific humor tactics) versus the ground truth's more open-ended emotional support approach",

      "Ground truth emphasizes 'you're being harder on yourself than anyone else' while evaluated response focuses more on 'everyone messes up' messaging",
      "Evaluated response includes specific tactical advice (using humor) that ground truth omits in favor of pure emotional validation",
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis and relies on italics for emphasis (*worst*), while evaluated response uses one emoji (😅) and no formatting"
