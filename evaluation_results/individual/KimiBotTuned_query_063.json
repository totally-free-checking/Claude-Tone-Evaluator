    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural paragraph flow that reads like a text conversation",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts for what to say ('Oops—wrong room, my bad' and 'Yeah, I totally mixed up the room') that are realistic for a teen to use",
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('instant stomach-drop moment') that immediately acknowledges the awkwardness"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel more like general advice than a personal conversation with a supportive friend",
      "Uses impersonal constructions like 'the smoothest move is' instead of 'I think the smoothest move is' or 'I'd just say', creating distance rather than connection",
      "Slightly heavier on practical advice versus emotional validation compared to the ground truth, tipping the balance toward solutions over support"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting without any bullet points or headers, flowing as conversational paragraphs that feel like texting",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective throughout the entire response - it never uses 'I' statements like 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I bet', making it feel less like a personal exchange and more like impersonal guidance",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, numbered lists, or headers. Advice is woven naturally into sentences rather than listed out."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses first-person language throughout ('I think we've all been there', 'I bet everyone forgot', 'Did you...') creating a personal connection, while the response uses entirely second-person and impersonal constructions",
      "Ground truth focuses more on validation and reassurance that others forget quickly, while the response dedicates more space to specific action scripts and 'what to do next time' advice",
      "Ground truth asks what the user actually did in the moment, while the response assumes they already left and gives advice for future scenarios"
