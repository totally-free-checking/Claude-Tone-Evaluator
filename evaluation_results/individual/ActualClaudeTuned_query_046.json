      "Immediate warm validation with 'Ugh, that's so rough!' followed by 'I totally get why that would hurt' - perfectly captures the empathetic first-person tone",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Includes a blue heart emoji (💙) when the ground truth uses none and the character profile prefers 0 emojis unless specifically asked",
