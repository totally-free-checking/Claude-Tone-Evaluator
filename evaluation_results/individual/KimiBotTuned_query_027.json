      "Excellent specific actionable advice including the exact script for messaging a teacher ('I'm really behind and trying to catch up—can I turn it in tomorrow/with a late penalty?')",
      "Strong emotional validation that normalizes the freeze response ('your brain isn't being lazy, it's kinda overwhelmed and trying to protect you')",
      "Natural conversational language without being cringe ('stupidly small', 'hitting the nope button')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language like 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' that Claude uses to establish personal connection (uses 'What usually helps is' instead)",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) while the ground truth used none; though within the 0-1 limit, it wasn't requested",
      "The follow-up question is slightly compound, asking for both the subject and details about all five assignments at once"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The validation of the brain freeze feeling and the specific, realistic advice that acknowledges teen agency limitations (like suggesting they can ask for an extension)",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person 'I' statements (such as 'I think', 'I'd suggest', or 'I totally get it') makes it feel slightly less like a personal conversation and more like general advice",

      "Includes specific advice about contacting teachers for extensions which the ground truth omitted",
      "Uses one emoji (😅) while ground truth used zero",
      "Does not use bold text formatting for emphasis (ground truth uses bolded phrases like '**Pick the tiniest possible step**')",
      "Asks for specific details about all five assignments rather than asking which feels 'least terrible'"
