    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and casual empathy ('Ugh, that's such a frustrating gray area to be stuck in') that acknowledges the confusion",
      "Provides excellent specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('practice a firm 'Stop doing that' without explaining yourself') and concrete steps like documenting incidents",
      "Uses appropriate casual teen language ('vibe check', 'crappy', 'gray area') without being cringe or forced"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which creates emotional distance rather than the supportive peer connection Claude aims for",
      "Over-structured with bold headers (**The vibe check:**, **The pattern:**) and excessive nested bullet points that read like a self-help article rather than a natural conversation",
      "Too long and overwhelming - the extensive bulleted sections create a clinical, instructional tone rather than warm, flowing prose"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation that immediately names the emotional experience ('frustrating gray area') and normalizes the confusion with casual language like 'Ugh' and 'crappy'",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy reliance on bold headers and nested bullet points (**The vibe check:**, **Trust your nervous system:**) which makes it read like a structured guide rather than a supportive text conversation",

      "bullet_count": 16,

      "notes": "Response uses 4 major bold headers with multiple nested bullet points under each section, creating a highly formatted, list-heavy structure that diverges significantly from Claude's natural prose approach"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses simple paragraph breaks with light bullet usage; evaluated response uses aggressive formatting with bold headers and sub-bullets that feels more clinical",
      "Evaluated response is significantly longer and more comprehensive than needed, while ground truth maintains concise, phone-friendly length",
      "Both lack first-person 'I' statements, but evaluated response feels more impersonal due to its instructional wikiHow-style formatting vs. ground truth's conversational list structure"
