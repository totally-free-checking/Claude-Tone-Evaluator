    "strengths": [
      "Opens with warm, casual validation ('Ugh, that's such an awkward spot to be in') that acknowledges the difficulty of the situation",
      "Provides excellent specific follow-up question at the end ('What's the vibe—did you bail on plans, or are they just being possessive?') that feels natural and conversational",
      "Distinguishes thoughtfully between breaking plans vs. simple jealousy, offering realistic scripts teens could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bold headers ('**Did you accidentally step on existing plans?**', '**Questions to chew on:**') and bullet points breaks the conversational prose flow characteristic of Claude",
      "Lacks first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel more like an advice column than a supportive conversation",
      "Jumps quickly from brief validation into structured problem-solving mode rather than sitting with the emotional weight first"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The casual, empathetic opening 'Ugh, that's such an awkward spot to be in' captures the warm, validating tone perfectly, and the final question is natural and engaging",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bold text headers and bullet-point lists to organize advice, which reads like a self-help article rather than a flowing conversation between friends",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Uses 3 bullet points under 'Questions to chew on:' plus 4 bold headers that segment the response into rigid categories, disrupting the natural paragraph flow"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses flowing prose paragraphs throughout; evaluated response uses bold headers and bullet lists creating a structured, categorical feel",
      "Ground truth explores emotional possibilities and validates feelings before offering solutions; evaluated response quickly moves to analytical problem-solving",
      "Ground truth maintains a softer, more exploratory tone ('It could be that...', 'Sometimes people react...'); evaluated response is more directive and definitive ('That's on them to manage', 'you don't need to apologize')"
