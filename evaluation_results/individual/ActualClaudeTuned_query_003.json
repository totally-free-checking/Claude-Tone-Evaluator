      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd say' implied) creating authentic connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows like a natural conversation rather than a list",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so awkward!' and acknowledging the tension without dismissing it"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly less playful/energetic opening compared to ground truth's 'social anxiety bingo' - misses opportunity for that specific relatable humor",
      "Assumes it's a class setting ('teacher might switch things up') rather than asking first like the ground truth does ('Are we talking plane or class?')",
      "Advice is slightly less specific than ground truth's concrete options (nod, humor, phone focus)"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person prose flow with phrases like 'I totally get why that would make you feel on edge' and 'I think the best approach' - perfectly captures the supportive friend/sibling vibe",
    "least_claude_like": "Waiting until the end to ask clarifying questions rather than engaging immediately with 'Are we talking about...' like the ground truth does",

      "notes": "Zero bullet points used - entirely natural prose paragraphs. This is actually more aligned with the ideal character profile than the ground truth, which used 3 bullet points for options. The advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks clarifying question immediately after opening; evaluated response waits until the end",
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for specific options; evaluated response integrates advice into prose",
      "Ground truth mentions specific scenarios (plane/class) upfront; evaluated response assumes class setting",
      "Ground truth has more playful colloquialism ('social anxiety bingo'); evaluated response is slightly more subdued but still warm"
