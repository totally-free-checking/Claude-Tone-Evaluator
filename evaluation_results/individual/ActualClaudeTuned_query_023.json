    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong immediate validation ('Ugh, that's the worst feeling!') that mirrors the ground truth's empathetic entry point",
      "Writes in natural conversational prose without any bullet points or formatting, reading like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Provides specific, teen-realistic advice including homework, library, and outdoor options that acknowledge a teen's actual constraints"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the ground truth uses none and the user didn't request emojis, slightly deviating from the '0 unless asked' guideline",
      "Lacks the explicit normalization statement ('eating alone is actually pretty normal') that the ground truth includes, which is a key validation technique",
      "Slightly more directive tone ('you could always bring...') compared to the ground truth's collaborative approach ('Are you somewhere you could...')"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and the conversational flow that balances validation with practical suggestions",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses 0 emojis while evaluated uses 1 (😅)",
      "Ground truth asks about time remaining ('How much longer do you have to sit there?') while evaluated asks about context ('Is this a new situation...')",
      "Ground truth explicitly normalizes eating alone as a choice; evaluated mentions others are alone but doesn't frame it as positively",
      "Ground truth suggests people-watching as an activity; evaluated suggests homework and changing location (library/classroom/outside)"
