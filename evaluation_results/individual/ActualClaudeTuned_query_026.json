    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'If I were you', 'I might try') creating a personal, supportive voice",
      "Natural conversational flow with appropriate casual phrasing ('from the jump', 'come at you sideways', 'super hard') without being cringe",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('I hear that you're frustrated with me') and concrete tactics (deep breaths, staying calm)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly more advice-heavy compared to the ground truth, which focused more on validation and questioning",
      "Ends with two questions rather than one focused follow-up, though they are naturally connected",
      "Could validate a bit longer before moving to the 'how to handle it' advice, as the transition happens quickly in paragraph 2"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format with zero bullet points and the warm, validating opening that immediately acknowledges the frustration using casual language ('Ugh, that's the worst!')",
    "least_claude_like": "The ratio of advice to validation leans slightly more toward practical solutions than the ground truth, which stayed in the emotional validation/questioning space longer before offering any tactical suggestions",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Flows naturally like a text conversation with 4 well-sized paragraphs."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses primarily on validation and asking about the context, while this response provides more immediate tactical advice for handling the conversation",
      "Ground truth uses slightly more concise phrasing (3 paragraphs vs 4), while this response expands on specific strategies for staying calm and responding",
      "Ground truth asks one focused question at the end, while this response asks two related questions about recent conflicts"
