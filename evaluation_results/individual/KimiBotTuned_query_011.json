    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd go for,' 'I love you,' 'I'm not trying') which creates that supportive friend-to-friend connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable conversation scripts that are realistic for teens to use ('I love you, but I've been feeling a little copied lately...')",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('you're not being petty for feeling this way') that acknowledges the suffocating feeling of being copied"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Jumps to specific solutions and scripts faster than Claude's ground truth, which spends more time exploring the friend's potential motivations first",
      "Suggests 'I love you' in the conversation script, which assumes a very close friendship level that might not apply to all teen friendships, whereas Claude keeps it more open-ended"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format with zero bullet points and heavy use of first-person language ('I'd say,' 'I get it' vibe) makes it feel like texting with a supportive older sibling",
    "least_claude_like": "The immediate provision of detailed conversation scripts and strategic advice (being vague about details) rather than Claude's more exploratory approach of asking about the friend's motivations before suggesting solutions",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs rather than being listed out"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks about whether the copying is conscious or unconscious to explore motivations; response to evaluate jumps straight to conversation tactics and scripts",
      "Ground truth asks if they've considered talking to the friend; response to evaluate provides specific verbatim scripts for what to say",
      "Response to evaluate includes a specific strategic recommendation (stop sharing details ahead of time) whereas ground truth focuses more on emotional validation and gentle questioning"
