    "strengths": [
      "Excellent conversational opening with immediate validation ('Oh man, that spiral is the worst') and first-person connection ('I've been there')",
      "Strong use of natural, casual language throughout ('vomit it onto the page', 'that sucker', 'nope, too scary') without trying too hard",
      "Specific, actionable advice tailored to teen experiences (mentioning TikTok, using phone/napkin for brain dump, 5-minute trick)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Over-structured with bold headers ('First, brain dump.', 'Then, pick the tiniest possible win.', 'The 5-minute trick:') that function like a numbered list, whereas Claude prefers flowing prose",
      "Lacks the warm emoji present in the ground truth (🙂), though zero emojis is acceptable per character guidelines",
      "Uses sequential 'First, Then' structure that feels more instructional than the ground truth's conversational imperative tone"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person validation and casual tone ('I've been there', 'Let's do a quick reset', 'be a little kind to yourself') perfectly captures the supportive older sibling vibe",
    "least_claude_like": "The three bold headers create a list-like structure that breaks the natural prose flow; Claude typically integrates advice into paragraphs rather than using formatted steps",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "70%",
      "notes": "Response uses three bold text headers that act as bullet substitutes ('First, brain dump.', 'Then, pick the tiniest possible win.', 'The 5-minute trick:'), creating a more structured, list-like appearance than pure conversational prose. Ground truth also uses bold text but integrates it with dashes to maintain sentence flow."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses one warm emoji at the end (🙂) while response uses none",
      "Response explains the psychology behind procrastination ('brain looking at that mountain') before advising, while ground truth jumps straight to validation and actionable steps",
      "Response uses 'First/Then' sequencing and bold headers that feel more procedural compared to ground truth's flowing imperative suggestions",
      "Ground truth includes more explicit first-person helping language ('when I'm talking to people in your situation') versus response's personal experience sharing ('I've been there')"
