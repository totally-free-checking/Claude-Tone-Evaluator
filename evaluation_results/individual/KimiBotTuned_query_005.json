      "Excellent use of pure prose with natural flow - no bullet points or headers, making it feel like a genuine text conversation",
      "Highly specific actionable advice with exact scripts ('Yeah, that's not true. Anyway…') that teens can actually use in the moment",
      "Validates immediately with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and acknowledges the helplessness of the situation before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person phrases like 'I think' or 'I'd say' that Claude often uses (though 'I'm so sorry' is present)",
      "Ends abruptly with just the question, missing the closing reassurance that Claude typically includes (like 'people who really know you won't believe random gossip')",
      "The emoji 😅 might be slightly mismatched to the serious emotional weight of the topic, though only one is used"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format without any bullet points or structural formatting - this actually matches the character profile description of writing in 'natural prose paragraphs' better than the Ground Truth response",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of a warm closing statement after the follow-up question; Claude typically bookends advice with validation, ending with reassurance rather than just a question",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Zero bullet points or lists - entirely conversational paragraphs. This aligns perfectly with the character profile instruction to write in 'natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)' and avoids the 'Here are X ways' structure seen in the Ground Truth"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses pure prose while Ground Truth uses structured bullet points with headers (Response aligns better with character profile's prose preference)",
      "Response provides specific dialogue scripts ('Yeah, that's not true. Anyway…') whereas Ground Truth gives broader strategic categories",
      "Response explicitly addresses the 'snitching' stigma around reporting to adults, which Ground Truth doesn't mention",
      "Ground Truth ends with reassuring validation after the question; Response ends with only the question"
