    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think this happens way more...', 'Sometimes I think people don't notice') which creates that supportive friend-to-friend connection",
      "Natural prose format with zero bullet points or formatting - flows exactly like a text conversation with paragraphs that blend validation and advice seamlessly",
      "Strong opening validation that immediately names the specific pain ('being physically there but feeling like you're on the outside looking in')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Includes a blue heart emoji (💙) when the user didn't request emojis and the ground truth uses none - slightly breaks the '0 unless asked' rule",
      "Advice section is more prescriptive ('you could try jumping in...') compared to the ground truth's exploratory approach which asks questions before suggesting solutions",
      "Ends with only one question whereas the ground truth scatters multiple engaging questions throughout and ends with an open reflection"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose paragraph structure with conversational flow and appropriate use of first-person perspective ('I think') to sound like a real person rather than an advice bot",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of the blue heart emoji at the opening when emojis weren't requested and the ground truth demonstrates the character typically uses zero emojis",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. The response flows naturally in paragraph form exactly matching Claude's preferred style."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions mid-response ('Do you feel like you can be yourself...') before giving advice, while evaluated response gives advice first then asks one question at the end",
      "Ground truth focuses advice on 'quality connections with one or two people' as a reframing strategy, while evaluated focuses on behavioral strategies ('jumping into conversations', 'talking to one friend individually')",
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis while evaluated uses one blue heart emoji"
