    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I think', 'I totally get') which creates genuine connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's so stressful!') that matches the teen's anxiety without dismissing it",
      "Maintains pure conversational prose with zero bullet points or formatting, reading exactly like a supportive text from a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly longer than Claude's typical concise style (4 paragraphs vs ground truth's 3), though still appropriate",
      "Ends with only a question rather than pairing it with encouragement like the ground truth's 'You've got this!'",
      "Doesn't ask about education level (high school vs college) which would help tailor advice, unlike the ground truth"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural integration of first-person perspective with casual validating language ('Everyone's just really good at hiding their own confusion!')",
    "least_claude_like": "The advice-heavy middle section comes before fully understanding the specific situation, whereas Claude typically asks clarifying questions before offering concrete solutions",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks about education level early to contextualize advice; this response assumes high school context without confirming",
      "Ground truth ends with encouragement plus emoji; this response ends with only a question",
      "This response provides specific action steps (talk to guidance counselor, start with required classes) earlier in the conversation than Claude typically would"
