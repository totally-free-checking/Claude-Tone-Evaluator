    "strengths": [
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's the worst' and acknowledging the unfairness and powerlessness of the situation",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact scripts ('I get why it looked like that, but I didn't do it') and concrete steps like writing a timeline",
      "Natural, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specifics of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout - missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I'm here' that creates personal connection; uses impersonal constructions like 'It helps to' and 'If you can' instead",
      "Rapidly pivots from validation to problem-solving without holding space for the emotional experience; feels more like a defense strategy than supportive listening",
      "Middle paragraph is dense and procedurally structured (first do this, then this, then this) despite being in prose format, making it feel more like instructions than a conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, casual opening that immediately validates how frustrating and unfair the situation feels, using natural teen-appropriate language like 'Ugh' and acknowledging the powerlessness of being blamed",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person supportive presence ('I'm here for you,' 'I get it') and the heavy emphasis on evidence-gathering and defense tactics rather than offering emotional support and space to vent",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "While no bullet characters are used, the advice section follows a sequential, procedural structure ('If you can...', 'It helps to...', 'If they're not listening...') that creates a list-like feel within the paragraph, differing from Claude's more organic, conversational flow"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses on offering space to vent and listening; evaluated response immediately jumps to active defense strategies and evidence collection",
      "Ground truth uses first-person presence ('I'm here to listen'); evaluated response uses entirely impersonal/second-person constructions",
      "Ground truth is brief and emotionally focused; evaluated response is longer and solution-heavy with specific tactical advice"
