    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of natural prose without any bullet points or headers, creating a conversational flow that feels like texting with a friend",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, I'm so sorry' and reassurance that they're not being 'dramatic' for caring",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing to use ('Hey, you posted a pic of me without asking. Please delete it') and realistic steps for teens"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The emoji choice (😅) feels slightly mismatched for the serious/violating nature of the situation - a 😊 or no emoji might fit better",
      "Could use slightly more explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to match Claude's typical voice, though 'Honestly' helps",
      "The transition from validation to advice is slightly abrupt - could use a softer bridge phrase"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The pure prose format with zero bullet points perfectly matches the character profile's emphasis on conversational paragraphs over structured lists, actually exceeding the Ground Truth which used bullet points",
    "least_claude_like": "The emoji usage, while within the 0-1 limit, uses 😅 (nervous laughter) which feels slightly off for a privacy violation scenario where a more supportive 😊 or no emoji would better match Claude's typical warmth",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, creating a much more conversational feel than the Ground Truth's structured bullet lists"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses pure prose while Ground Truth uses bullet points with headers (Immediate action, Know your rights, For the future)",
      "Response includes more specific scenarios (sexual content, minors) and explicit script suggestions, while Ground Truth is more general",
      "Response asks about the platform and relationship type at the end, while Ground Truth asks about feelings first then relationship",
      "Response validates that anger/anxiety is normal; Ground Truth focuses more on the violation aspect"
