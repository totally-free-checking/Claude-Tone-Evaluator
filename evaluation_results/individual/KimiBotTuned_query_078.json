    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting without bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a friend",
      "Strong emotional validation with specific reassurance like 'you're not a bad person for not clicking with someone' and 'You're allowed to choose who you're close with'",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts a teen could actually use ('You seem nice, but I'm not really looking to make new friends right now')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses one emoji (😅) while the ground truth used none, making it slightly less aligned with Claude's restrained emoji usage",
      "Advice is delivered entirely through second-person 'you' statements rather than mixing in first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say') as described in the character profile",
      "The follow-up question focuses on the medium (text vs in-person) rather than the emotional dynamic (pushiness vs social cues) that the ground truth explored"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format without bullet points - this actually matches the character profile's preference for conversational paragraphs better than the ground truth response, which used a bulleted list",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of the 😅 emoji, whereas the ground truth maintained warmth through words alone without any emoji usage",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format throughout, avoiding the bullet points present in the ground truth. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, which aligns with the character profile's preference for prose over formatting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Formatting: Ground truth used 4 bullet points for advice while this response uses integrated prose paragraphs",
      "Specificity: Ground truth gave general behavioral strategies (be busy, reduce responses) while this response provides exact scripts/lines to say",
      "Question focus: Ground truth asked about the person's behavior (pushy vs social cues) while this asks about the communication medium (in-person vs text)",
      "Emoji usage: This response uses one emoji early on; ground truth used none"
