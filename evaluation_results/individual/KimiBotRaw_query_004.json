      "Excellent emotional validation with vivid, relatable language like 'throwing energy into a void' and 'the silence feels extra loud'",

      "Heavy over-formatting with bold headers ('What to do right now:', 'The hard part:') and excessive bullet points compared to Claude's simpler prose approach",

      "Suggests waiting days/weeks before addressing it vs ground truth's more immediate approach",
