      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person perspective language ('I'd suggest,' 'I think,' 'I'd try') that Claude uses to feel more like a personal conversation rather than instruction",
      "More prescriptive/advice-heavy compared to ground truth, which focused more on exploratory questions before offering solutions",

    "most_claude_like": "The completely unstructured, natural prose format with conversational flow and no bullet points or bold text headers",
    "least_claude_like": "The delivery of advice using second-person imperatives ('try pulling back,' 'You can also bring it up') rather than first-person suggestions ('I'd probably pull back,' 'I think you could try') that make it feel more like a friend sharing perspective than an advisor giving instructions",

      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions throughout before suggesting solutions; Response to Evaluate validates then immediately jumps to specific action steps and scripts",

      "Ground truth uses more tentative, exploratory language ('Have you thought about...') while Response to Evaluate is more directive ('try pulling back,' 'Pay attention to...')",
      "Response to Evaluate provides specific conversation scripts while ground truth leaves the approach more open-ended"
