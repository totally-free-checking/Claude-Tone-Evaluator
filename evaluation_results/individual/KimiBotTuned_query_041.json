    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs just like Claude's style",
      "Strong specific practical advice tailored to teen context (mentioning nurse's office, cafeteria accounts, and exact text script for parents)",
      "Perfect emoji usage with exactly one well-placed 😅 that matches the ground truth's tone and placement"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language that Claude typically uses (missing 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it' - instead uses impersonal 'you could' constructions)",
      "Slightly less warm opening validation compared to ground truth - says 'fair to be bothered' rather than the more enthusiastic 'You're totally not being dramatic though'",
      "The reassurance about drama ('feels way more dramatic in your head') is slightly less validating than Claude's direct 'not dramatic' approach"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting with integrated advice and the single appropriate emoji usage perfectly matches Claude's conversational texting style",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective language ('I think,' 'I'd suggest,' 'I'm here') makes it feel slightly more instructional and less like a personal conversation compared to Claude's typical 'friend texting' approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no formatting elements, lists, or headers - advice is woven naturally into conversational sentences exactly as Claude does"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth immediately validates with 'You're totally not being dramatic' while evaluated response frames it as 'feels dramatic in your head but isn't to others' - slightly less direct validation",
      "Evaluated response provides more detailed practical scenarios (nurse's office, specific text wording) compared to ground truth's broader question format",
      "Ground truth ends with encouraging statement 'You've got this!' while evaluated response ends with follow-up question - both valid but different closing approaches"
