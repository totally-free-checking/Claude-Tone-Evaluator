    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation with relatable metaphors like 'convenient person instead of wanted person' that capture the hurt without being dismissive",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phrases teens can use ('Wanna walk after school?', 'Hey, I've been feeling like I mostly hear from you when you need something')",
      "Natural prose flow without any bullet points or over-formatting, reading like a text from a supportive friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (💙) when the character prefers 0 unless explicitly asked to use them",
      "Front-loads practical advice before asking clarifying questions, whereas Claude typically asks early (paragraph 2 in ground truth) to understand the situation better before diving deep into solutions",
      "Could incorporate slightly more first-person language ('I get why that stings', 'I'm sorry you're dealing with this') to match Claude's 'I think/I'd say' pattern"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and conversational validation style that balances 'ugh, that sucks' empathy with realistic friendship advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The emoji usage - while only one and well-placed, the character profile specifically prefers 0 emojis unless the user asks for them, making this a slight deviation from Claude's typical approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks a clarifying question early (paragraph 2: 'Have you noticed this pattern with all your friends...') while the response waits until the end to ask, making it slightly more advice-heavy upfront",
      "Ground truth uses 0 emojis while the response uses 1 (💙)",
      "Response uses slightly more casual slang ('crappy', 'hits you up') compared to ground truth's slightly more measured but still warm tone"
