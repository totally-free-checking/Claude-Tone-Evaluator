    "strengths": [
      "Opens with relatable, warm validation that captures the mixed feelings perfectly ('50% exciting and 50% wait, am I about to stand in a corner holding a drink for 3 hours?')",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable advice that's realistic for teens (the '3-second rule,' arriving early strategy, 45-minute exit plan)",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the specifics of their situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold formatting (**If you decide to go:**, **Arrive early**, etc.) makes it read like a wikiHow article rather than a conversational text",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') that makes Claude's responses feel personal and supportive",
      "Jumps to tactical solutions too quickly without enough initial emotional validation - the 'cheat sheet' approach feels instructional rather than supportive"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, conversational opening that validates the 'limbo feeling' with humor and empathy, capturing the exact emotional uncertainty of the situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily structured formatting with bold headers and extensive bullet points that transforms the response from a supportive conversation into a tactical guide",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Uses bold headers (**If you decide to go:**, **If you're not feeling it:**) followed by multiple bullet points with bold lead-ins. This extensive structuring is a major departure from Claude's natural prose approach."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses natural prose paragraphs with minimal formatting; evaluated response uses heavy bullet lists and bold headers resembling a self-help article",
      "Ground truth focuses primarily on emotional validation and exploratory questions with brief advice at the end; evaluated response immediately jumps to tactical 'cheat sheet' advice",
      "Ground truth is concise (2 short paragraphs + 3 simple bullets); evaluated response is significantly longer and more detailed, potentially overwhelming for a teen seeking quick support"
