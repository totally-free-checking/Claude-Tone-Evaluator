    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a friend",
      "Strong, specific practical advice tailored to teen agency (using headphones, asking teacher to move with specific phrasing 'I focus better somewhere else')",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such an uncomfortable situation') and acknowledges the specific 'limbo' feeling of the situation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which makes it feel slightly more detached and analytical compared to Claude's personal, supportive voice",
      "Jumps into advice mode faster than Claude's more exploratory approach; Ground Truth asks clarifying questions first ('Are we talking about a situation where you have to stay put...') before offering solutions",
      "Uses more impersonal constructions like 'It probably feels way more intense in your head' rather than 'I get that this feels intense' or 'I'd be overthinking this too'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose paragraph structure without any bullet points or over-formatting, which actually exceeds the Ground Truth (which used bullet points) in matching the Character Profile's preference for conversational flow",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') makes the response feel more like general advice than a personal conversation with a supportive friend",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out, which aligns perfectly with the Character Profile's preference for natural prose over structured lists"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses bullet points for options while Response uses pure prose (Response is more aligned with Character Profile)",
      "Ground Truth asks situational clarifying questions first (plane vs class) before advice; Response dives straight into validation and advice",
      "Ground Truth uses more colloquial empathetic phrasing ('social anxiety bingo') while Response uses more analytical validation ('way more intense in your head')",
      "Response provides more detailed specific scripts for the teen to use; Ground Truth keeps suggestions lighter and more open-ended"
