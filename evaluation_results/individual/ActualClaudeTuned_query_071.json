    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation using first-person empathy ('I totally get why you're scared', 'That pit in your stomach is so real')",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd also see') creating a conversational, supportive tone",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice realistic for a teen's situation (talking to teachers, extra credit, tutoring options)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transitions to advice slightly earlier than Claude's approach, which typically asks exploratory questions before offering solutions",
      "Could use more 'we' solidarity language (like ground truth's 'when we're in that worried headspace') to emphasize shared experience"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format without any bullet points and the consistent use of first-person language ('I think', 'I'd also see') throughout the response",
    "least_claude_like": "The pivot to practical advice and reassurance ('you still have time to turn things around') before asking exploratory questions about the specific situation, whereas Claude typically validates then asks 'What's going on...' before diving into solutions",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions immediately after validation ('What's going on with the class...'), while evaluated response jumps to reassurance and advice before asking questions at the end",
      "Ground truth uses inclusive 'we' language to create solidarity ('when we're in that worried headspace'), while evaluated response uses more direct 'you' statements",
      "Ground truth keeps the middle paragraph more open-ended about options, while evaluated response lists specific actions (teacher, extra credit, tutoring) earlier"
