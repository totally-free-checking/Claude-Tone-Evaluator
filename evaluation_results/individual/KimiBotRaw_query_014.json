      "Opens with strong validation and empathy ('Oh man, that's such an uncomfortable spot to be in', 'you didn't choose to know this, so try not to beat yourself up')",
      "Provides very specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, I accidentally learned something about you...', 'I can tell you're processing something heavy')",
      "Ends with engaging, specific questions that invite continuation ('How'd you end up finding out? Was it an accident or did they actually confide in you?')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers (**Zip it, obviously.**, **Consider the source.**, etc.) breaks conversational flow and reads like a self-help article rather than a text from a friend",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel more impersonal and advisory rather than supportive",
      "Uses detached phrasing like 'Here's the usual playbook' which feels corporate compared to Claude's warmer, more personal approach"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The immediate emotional validation at the beginning acknowledging the awkwardness of the situation and giving permission to feel anxious about it",
    "least_claude_like": "The bold header formatting (**Zip it, obviously.**) which creates a structured, list-heavy format rather than natural prose paragraphs",

      "notes": "While not traditional bullet points, the four bold headers (**Zip it, obviously.**, **Consider the source.**, **Act normal.**, **Set boundaries if needed.**) function as section dividers and create a heavily structured, formatted appearance unlike Claude's preferred natural paragraph flow. The ground truth uses simple dashes which are less intrusive."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses light dash bullets within prose; evaluated response uses aggressive bold headers that dominate the formatting",
      "Ground truth is concise (2 short paragraphs + light bullets); evaluated response is significantly longer with 4 distinct advice sections",
      "Ground truth asks one natural follow-up question; evaluated response asks two questions which feels slightly more interrogative",
      "Evaluated response lacks the casual, observational tone ('It sounds like maybe...') in favor of imperative commands ('Zip it', 'Act normal')"
