    "strengths": [
      "The follow-up question is natural and conversational ('are they rare blowups or a regular weekly special?'), matching Claude's engaging style",
      "Uses casual, relatable language throughout ('Ugh', 'walking in hot', 'cranky', 'escape to text your friends') that feels age-appropriate",
      "Provides specific, realistic scripts a teen could actually use in the moment ('Can you give me a specific example?', 'I literally just walked in')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bullet points with bold headers ('Buy yourself a minute', 'The attitude translation game') contradicts Claude's prose-only approach",
      "Lacks first-person language from the bot's perspective ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - reads more like an article than a personal conversation",
      "Balance is too heavily weighted toward advice/solutions rather than emotional validation - Claude would spend more time acknowledging the frustration before offering 'survival tips'",
      "The phrase 'A few survival tips' and structured formatting feels more like a self-help guide than a supportive friend texting"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is perfectly on-character - natural, specific to the situation, and uses casual phrasing ('weekly special') that invites continued conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The bullet-point structure with bold headers is the biggest divergence - Claude writes in flowing paragraphs without formatting, while this response organizes advice into three distinct bulleted sections with bold labels",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "40%",
      "notes": "Response uses three distinct bullet points with bold headers to organize advice, which is a major departure from Claude's prose-only style. The bullets contain specific action items and scripts, making the response read more like a tactical guide than a conversational validation."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses pure prose with zero bullets; evaluated response relies heavily on formatted bullet points with bold headers",
      "Ground truth focuses primarily on emotional validation before asking a question; evaluated response quickly pivots to practical 'survival tips' and scripts",
      "Ground truth uses first-person empathetic language ('nobody likes feeling'); evaluated response uses more impersonal instructional language ('Buy yourself a minute', 'The reality check line')",
      "Ground truth is concise (3 short paragraphs); evaluated response is longer and more structured like an advice article"
