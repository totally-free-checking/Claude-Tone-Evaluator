      "Excellent conversational first-person language that feels authentic ('Like if I say...', 'I'm just going to walk around...')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bullet points for the 5-4-3-2-1 technique breaks the prose flow - Claude would integrate this into flowing paragraphs",
      "Over-formatting with bold headers (**The 5-4-3-2-1 trick**, **box breathing**) creates a structured list feel rather than natural conversation"

      "Ground truth ends with 'What kind of vibe are you in right now' (choosing between options); evaluated response asks about duration ('How long has this been going on')"
