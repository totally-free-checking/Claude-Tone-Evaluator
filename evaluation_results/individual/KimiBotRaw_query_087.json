    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and normalization ('Ugh, that's such a tough spot', 'needing space doesn't make you a bad friend at all—it's actually super normal and healthy')",
      "Provides excellent specific scripts teens can actually use ('Hey, I love hanging out with you, but I need some alone time to recharge')",
      "Uses natural casual language and contractions throughout ('blowing up your phone', 'heads-down', 'super normal')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bold headers and bullet points creates a listicle format rather than conversational prose flow ('**The gradual fade**', '**Boundaries to set:**')",
      "Lacks first-person perspective language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal constructions like 'Here's the thing' instead",
      "Asks multiple questions rather than one natural follow-up ('Have they always been like this...' and 'What feels most doable...')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that immediately normalizes the teen's feelings without judgment",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily structured formatting with bold section headers and bullet-point lists that reads more like a wikiHow article than a text conversation",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth integrates advice into looser structure while response uses rigid bold headers and bullet categories",
      "Ground truth asks one specific follow-up question at the end; response asks two questions (one mid-text, one at end)",
      "Ground truth uses 'Oh man' and more enthusiastic warmth; response uses 'Ugh' which is slightly less warm/enthusiastic",
      "Response includes specific boundary-setting language about not owing explanations, which is more prescriptive than ground truth"
