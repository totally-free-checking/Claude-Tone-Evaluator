    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong empathetic validation ('that sinking feeling after a test is literally the worst') that mirrors Claude's approach",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that shows genuine interest in the teen's current emotional state",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice like the 4-7-8 breathing technique and avoiding answer-checking online"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers ('**For right now:**', '**When you're ready:**') and bullet points creates a structured, list-heavy format unlike Claude's prose-heavy style",
      "Uses college-specific terminology ('professors', 'office hours') rather than general teen-appropriate language ('teachers') used in the ground truth",
      "Lacks Claude's characteristic first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') throughout most of the response, making it feel more impersonal"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation that immediately acknowledges the emotional weight ('that sinking feeling') and the conversational closing question that invites further sharing",
    "least_claude_like": "The structured formatting with bold section headers and multiple bullet point lists, which reads like a self-help article rather than a supportive text conversation",

      "notes": "Response uses two separate bulleted lists with bold headers ('For right now' and 'When you're ready'), creating a visually structured format that breaks the conversational flow. Ground truth uses only 3 bullets in a single unstructured list."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses bold headers and multiple bullet lists instead of flowing natural prose paragraphs",
      "References 'professors' and 'office hours' (college context) rather than 'teachers' (general teen context)",
      "Missing first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') that makes Claude's responses feel personal and warm"
