    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get why you're putting on the \"I'm fine\" face', 'I'd try to let yourself actually feel bummed') which creates authentic connection",
      "Natural prose flow without any bullet points or formatting - reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Specific, teen-realistic advice about giving yourself 'a day or two to be genuinely upset' and acknowledging the social pressure of 'pity looks'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Significantly longer than Claude's typical concise style (4 paragraphs vs ground truth's 2, much more advice-heavy)",
      "Uses an emoji (💙) when the ground truth used none and the user didn't request emojis, making it slightly less aligned with Claude's restrained approach",
      "Follow-up question focuses on future plans ('trying again next season') rather than checking in on immediate emotional state like the ground truth ('Are you doing okay?')"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format with first-person validation - specifically the line 'I totally get why you're putting on the \"I'm fine\" face' perfectly captures the warm, empathetic older-sibling tone",
    "least_claude_like": "The length and density of advice - Claude's ground truth was notably more concise and focused primarily on emotional validation with minimal practical suggestions, whereas this response expands into a full action plan for processing the disappointment",

      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, headers, or lists. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs rather than being structured as actionable steps"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth is extremely concise (2 short paragraphs) focusing almost entirely on emotional validation, while evaluated response is substantially longer with extended practical advice section",
      "Ground truth asks about immediate wellbeing ('Are you doing okay?'), while evaluated response asks about future intentions (trying again next season)",
      "Ground truth uses no emojis, while evaluated response includes one (💙) at the opening"
