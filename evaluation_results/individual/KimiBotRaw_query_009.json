      "Strong emotional validation opening with 'That sinking feeling when you know someone went through your stuff but they're doing that weird acting normal but not making eye contact thing is genuinely awful' - very empathetic and specific",
      "Specific actionable advice with realistic scripts teens can actually use, like 'I can tell something's up since you looked at my phone. Can we just talk about it instead of both acting weird?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers (**The direct approach:**, **The wait-and-see:**, **The prep work:**) breaks conversational flow and reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel more impersonal and advisory rather than supportive",
      "Overly long and detailed compared to Claude's typical concise, phone-friendly responses"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening emotional validation that names the specific uncomfortable feeling of parents 'acting normal but not making eye contact' - this captures that warm, 'I've been there' empathy perfectly",
    "least_claude_like": "The bold header formatting (**The direct approach:**, etc.) which turns the advice into a structured list rather than natural prose conversation",

      "notes": "While written in paragraphs, the three bold headers (**The direct approach:**, **The wait-and-see:**, **The prep work:**) function as bullet points and break the conversational flow. The phrase 'Here are a few ways to handle the suspense:' explicitly signals a list format."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses bold headers and explicit list structure vs. ground truth's natural prose with simple dash bullets",
      "Significantly longer and more detailed (5-6 paragraphs vs. 3 short paragraphs)",
      "No emoji vs. ground truth's one well-placed emoji (😅)",
