      "Opens with strong validation ('Ugh, that's the worst!') that acknowledges the stress of carrying someone else's weight",
      "Provides excellent specific, actionable advice including exact text templates the teen can copy/paste and realistic timeline management for the tight deadline"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') making it feel like an instruction manual rather than a supportive conversation",
      "Ends with no follow-up question to continue the dialogue, unlike Claude's approach which nearly always invites further conversation",
      "Over-structured with four separate bold headers and extensive bullet points that read like a wikiHow article rather than natural prose"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality is very high with realistic, teen-specific strategies including documentation tips and rubric checking",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any first-person perspective or natural conversational flow - it reads as impersonal directive advice rather than 'I'm here with you' support",

      "bullet_count": 12,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response is heavily formatted with four bold header sections (Tonight's game plan, Cover your butt, Tomorrow morning, For next time) containing multiple bullet points each, creating a listicle format rather than conversational paragraphs"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses first-person empathy ('I feel for you', 'I can help you') while evaluated response uses entirely second-person directive language with no 'I' statements",
      "Ground truth ends with an engaging specific question ('What kind of project is it?') while evaluated response ends with generic encouragement and no question",
      "Ground truth balances bullets with substantial prose wrapping; evaluated response is approximately 75% bullets/headers with minimal connecting prose"
