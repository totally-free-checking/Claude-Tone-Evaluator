    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of natural prose without any bullet points or headers, flowing exactly like a supportive conversation",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('Hey, you've been acting kinda off...' and the boundary-setting language)",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('icky, exposed feeling') that acknowledges the vulnerability of the situation without being dismissive"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question includes a slightly list-like parenthetical ('texts, photos, social media, search history') which breaks the pure conversational flow slightly",
      "Could use slightly more explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' in the advice section to match Claude's 'I get it' style, though 'I get' is used well"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points actually exceeds the ground truth (which used bullet points) and perfectly matches the character's preference for conversational paragraphs over structured lists",
    "least_claude_like": "The parenthetical list of examples in the final question is slightly less natural than Claude's typical open-ended questions, though still engaging",

      "bullet_count": 0,

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response to Evaluate uses pure prose while Ground Truth uses bullet points for 'A few thoughts'",
      "Response to Evaluate provides more detailed specific scripts/phrases for the teen to use, while Ground Truth gives a simpler example",
      "Response to Evaluate uses 'icky' and more visceral emotional descriptors, while Ground Truth uses 'awkward' and 'tense'"
