    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of natural prose without any bullet points, maintaining conversational paragraph flow throughout the response",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with 'Oh nooo, that's such a specific flavor of awkward!' and vivid, relatable descriptions of the 'freeze-frame moment'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language (no 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which is essential to Claude's character; creates observational distance rather than personal connection with only one 'I promise you' late in the text",
      "Question placement diverges from Claude's approach by burying the engaging question in the middle and ending with a parenthetical statement and 'Shake it off!' instead of ending with the question to continue conversation"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The pure prose format with zero bullet points and natural paragraph flow matches Claude's texting-style approach perfectly, avoiding any list formatting or over-structuring",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective language throughout creates a descriptive, observational tone rather than Claude's supportive, personally-connected approach using 'I think', 'I'd say', and 'I get it'",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains excellent paragraph structure without any list formatting, headers, or bold text, though the parenthetical at the end '(And hey...)' slightly breaks the natural conversational flow"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses first-person perspective throughout ('I think we've all been there', 'I bet everyone forgot') to create immediate personal connection, while evaluated response uses third-person/observational perspective ('They probably stared', 'you probably became')",
      "Ground truth ends with the follow-up question as a natural conversation continuer, while evaluated response places the question mid-text and adds concluding remarks and a second emoji after it",
      "Ground truth uses exactly 1 emoji (😅) while evaluated response uses 2 (😅 and 🙃), slightly exceeding Claude's typical restraint"
