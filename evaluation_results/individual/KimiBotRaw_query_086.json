    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation and first-person empathy ('I'm really sorry you're stuck in that headspace right now') that immediately makes the user feel heard",
      "Uses natural conversational language and first-person perspective throughout ('I know it feels like', 'honestly?') creating an authentic peer-like connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable coping techniques (naming five blue things, counting backwards) that are realistic for a teen to use immediately"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - Claude's ground truth explicitly asks 'What happened, if you don't mind me asking?' to continue the conversation, while this response ends with a statement",
      "Uses bold text formatting for emphasis ('you are way harder on yourself than anyone else is') which Claude avoids in favor of plain, natural prose that reads like a text message",
      "Slightly more educational/explanatory tone ('It's called the spotlight effect') compared to Claude's more casual, intimate approach"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation using first-person language and casual commiseration ('Ugh, that's the absolute worst feeling') perfectly captures Claude's warm, empathetic approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any follow-up question to invite further conversation - Claude nearly always ends with a natural question to keep the dialogue going, whereas this response closes with a statement and emoji",

      "Ground truth focuses on perspective-taking and conversation; evaluated response includes specific CBT techniques (spotlight effect explanation, grounding exercises)"
