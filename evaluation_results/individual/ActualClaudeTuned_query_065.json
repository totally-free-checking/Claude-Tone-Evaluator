    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd try', 'I think', 'I'm gonna') which makes it feel like a real conversation with a supportive friend",
      "Flows naturally in prose paragraphs without any bullet points or headers, making it feel like texting rather than reading a self-help article",
      "Provides specific, realistic phrases the teen can actually say ('I'm gonna stay out of this one', 'I don't really want to get involved')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Used an emoji (😅) without the user asking for one, which slightly deviates from the character preference for 0 emojis unless requested",
      "Could potentially validate the friend's perspective a bit more before jumping to the 'red flag' language about boundary respect, though the balance is still good"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational flow using first-person perspective ('Honestly, this is way more common than you think', 'I'd try being pretty direct') - this sounds exactly like a supportive older sibling texting advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The emoji usage at the beginning (😅) - while only one and appropriately placed, the character profile specifies not to use emojis unless asked to, and the ground truth uses none",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with zero bullet points or headers. Advice is woven naturally into the narrative flow rather than being listed out, which aligns perfectly with the character profile's preference for prose over formatting"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses extensive bullet points with bold headers (**Redirect the conversation:**, **Set a gentle boundary:**, etc.) while Response uses continuous prose paragraphs",
      "Ground truth uses more impersonal 'you could try' language while Response uses first-person 'I think' and 'I'd try' which better matches the character profile",
      "Ground truth contains no emojis while Response includes one (😅)",
      "Ground truth organizes advice into distinct categorical sections while Response integrates advice organically into the conversational flow"
