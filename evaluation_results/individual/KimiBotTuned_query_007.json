    "strengths": [
      "Uses pure prose format with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd send them,' 'I'm going to complete it,' 'I've reached out') making it feel personal and authentic",
      "Provides extremely specific, actionable scripts the teen can literally copy and paste ('Hey, it's due tomorrow. What can you finish tonight by 9pm?...')",
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('Ugh, that's the absolute worst,' 'that panicky feeling is so real') before moving to solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The follow-up question is slightly compound (asking both about project type AND communication status in one breath), making it marginally less natural than a single focused question",
      "Could include slightly more explicit reassurance that the teacher will understand, as the ground truth does ('teachers usually know how to handle it') to reduce anxiety"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting with embedded first-person advice ('I'd send them a super direct message...') rather than list-based recommendations",
    "least_claude_like": "The compound ending question that combines two distinct inquiries (project type + communication history) rather than one flowing follow-up",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Response is entirely paragraph-based with no bullet points, headers, or bold formatting, which aligns perfectly with the character profile's preference for natural prose over structured lists"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bold headers and bullet points for organization; response uses flowing prose with advice embedded naturally in sentences",
      "Ground truth provides general action categories; response offers specific word-for-word scripts the teen can use",
      "Ground truth emphasizes 'don't kill yourself doing two people's work' and teacher understanding; response focuses more on practical survival mode and documentation strategies"
