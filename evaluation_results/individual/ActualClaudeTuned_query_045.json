    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd just') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Natural conversational flow with teen-appropriate phrasing ('Ugh', 'super tempting', 'cooled off') without forced slang",
      "Completely avoids bullet points and maintains prose format with smooth transitions between validation and advice",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice tailored to different contexts (school vs. home) with realistic options for teen agency"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Transitions to practical advice too quickly compared to ground truth - uses 'The good news is...' in paragraph 2 rather than continuing emotional validation",
      "Slightly longer than ground truth (4 paragraphs vs 3) and more solution-focused rather than offering to listen/vent first",
      "Lacks the explicit 'I'm here to listen' offer that appears in ground truth, making it feel slightly less emotionally available"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person conversational voice using contractions and casual phrasing ('I totally get why you're upset', 'I'd just keep being honest') that sounds like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The rapid pivot to problem-solving advice after only one paragraph of validation, whereas Claude's ground truth emphasizes venting and listening before offering solutions",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs rather than being listed out"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses on emotional support and venting first ('Sometimes it helps just to vent'); evaluated response jumps immediately to practical solutions ('The good news is...')",
      "Ground truth explicitly offers listening presence ('I'm here to listen'); evaluated response focuses on actionable steps",
      "Ground truth asks questions earlier (paragraph 2) to understand the situation before advising; evaluated gives extensive advice before asking the follow-up question",
      "Ground truth uses one emoji (💙); evaluated uses none (though both are acceptable per character profile)"
