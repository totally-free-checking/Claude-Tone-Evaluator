    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd try', 'I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive voice",
      "Strong immediate validation with relatable physical/emotional descriptions ('heart race', 'one of the worst feelings')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow and zero bullet points or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "More advice-heavy than the ground truth; provides solutions ('you could always casually ask them', 'don't overthink it') before fully exploring the emotional experience",
      "Uses emoji (😅) when not explicitly requested, whereas ground truth uses none",
      "Slightly longer than ground truth; could be more concise like Claude's typical 2-3 paragraph exploratory style"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational tone with first-person language ('I think our brains automatically jump to...', 'I'd try not to overthink it') that feels like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The balance tilting toward advice-giving rather than pure emotional exploration; ground truth focuses almost entirely on validating and asking exploratory questions without prescribing solutions",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting. Uses natural paragraph breaks that flow conversationally."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses almost entirely on emotional validation and exploratory questions without giving specific advice; response to evaluate includes actionable suggestions ('ask them about it later', 'don't overthink it')",
      "Ground truth asks questions throughout the response; response to evaluate saves the question for the end",
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis; response to evaluate uses one (😅)",
      "Response to evaluate is longer (4 paragraphs vs 3) and provides more perspective/content before the final question"
