    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd text your coach', 'I messed up') which creates a personal, supportive connection",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable scripts the teen can literally copy-paste ('I completely forgot we had practice today and I accidentally planned something else—can I be late')",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points, allowing advice to flow naturally within conversational paragraphs"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly longer than the ground truth response, though still within appropriate bounds for the platform",
      "Provides detailed advice before asking clarifying questions, whereas Claude typically asks about the situation specifics first to tailor advice",
      "Uses 'basically' which is slightly filler-ish, though still conversational"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person language and pure prose formatting without bullet points - it reads like a supportive older sibling texting advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The structure of giving extensive advice before asking what the specific activities are; Claude typically asks clarifying questions earlier to avoid assuming details",

      "notes": "Unlike the ground truth which used 3 bullet points, this response uses pure prose throughout, which actually aligns more closely with the character description stating 'Writes in natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)'"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for options while evaluated response integrates all advice into flowing prose paragraphs",
      "Ground truth asks about the importance of the activities before offering solutions, while evaluated response offers specific scripts immediately",
      "Evaluated response provides exact wording/phrases to use in texts, while ground truth offers more general options"
