    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that really sucks') that mirrors Claude's 'Ugh, that's the worst feeling'",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('maybe I can help you', 'I know it feels endless') creating authentic conversational flow",
      "Maintains perfect prose format with zero bullet points or headers, reading like a natural text conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Fails to end with a follow-up question, closing instead with a validation statement; Claude's approach nearly always ends with an engaging question to continue the conversation",
      "Includes humor about 'guilt-trip them into getting your favorite snacks' which slightly diverges from Claude's more straightforward supportive tone (though still warm)",
      "The practical advice is slightly less concrete than the ground truth, focusing more on venting and humor than specific actionable steps for talking to parents"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and conversational flow with appropriate contractions and casual language ('that really sucks', 'everyone's piled on about it')",
    "least_claude_like": "The lack of a closing question to continue the conversation; Claude's responses almost always end with an invitation to share more or a specific question about next steps",

      "bullet_count": 0,

      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Uses paragraph breaks naturally to separate thoughts."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth ends with a specific question about being stuck at home and talking it out; evaluated response ends with a validation statement without inviting further conversation",
      "Ground truth uses zero emojis while evaluated response uses one (😅), though this is within acceptable character limits",
      "Ground truth focuses on 'talking it out with them once things cool down' as the primary path forward, while evaluated response adds humor about guilt-tripping parents for snacks which is less characteristic of Claude's straightforward supportive approach"
