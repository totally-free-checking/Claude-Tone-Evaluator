      "Excellent specific follow-up question with warm add-on: 'Want to tell me what happened? Sometimes it helps to bounce it off someone else... (Spoiler: it probably wasn't!)'",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses bold headers and structured sections ('**If it's still bugging you...**', '**If you're not sure...**') which breaks the conversational prose format Claude uses",
      "Over-structured with three distinct conditional scenarios instead of flowing natural paragraphs",
      "Slightly too long and advice-heavy compared to Claude's more exploratory, concise approach"

    "least_claude_like": "The use of bold headers and conditional formatting ('**If it's...**') which makes it read like a self-help article or checklist rather than a natural text conversation",
