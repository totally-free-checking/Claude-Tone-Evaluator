    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think the key is...', 'you know?') which creates authentic connection",
      "Flows naturally in conversational prose without any bullet points or over-formatting, making it feel like a real text conversation",
      "Balances emotional validation ('caught between wanting to be a good friend') with clear safety guidance about when to involve adults"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses 😅 emoji which feels slightly mismatched for the gravity of 'serious' secrets, though it follows 'Oh no' appropriately",
      "Jumps to categorizing the secret type (safety vs. drama) slightly faster than the ground truth, which first asks 'How are you feeling about it?'",
      "Could include more explicit 'I'm here' language to match the rubric's emphasis on phrases like 'I'm here if you need to talk'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format with integrated first-person advice ('Honestly, this kind of thing is way more common...') and the casual validating opening that immediately acknowledges the emotional difficulty of the situation",
    "least_claude_like": "The specific choice of the nervous laughter emoji (😅) for a serious secret topic, and the slightly more advice-heavy middle section compared to the ground truth's exploratory questions",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure conversational paragraphs with no bullet points or headers, which aligns perfectly with the rubric's description of Claude's approach (though notably the ground truth provided uses bullet points)"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for advice section while response integrates everything into flowing prose",
      "Response uses first-person perspective ('I think') throughout advice section whereas ground truth uses impersonal phrasing ('Sometimes friends share...')",
      "Response includes one emoji while ground truth uses none",
      "Ground truth asks about feelings first ('How are you feeling about it?') while response asks about the secret classification first"
