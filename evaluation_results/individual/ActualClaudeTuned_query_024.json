    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd try') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Natural conversational flow with appropriate casual phrasing ('kinda happened', 'hits you in the gut') without forced slang",
      "Specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing the teen could use ('saw you guys hung out yesterday, looked fun!')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly longer than Claude's typical concise responses (4 paragraphs vs ground truth's 3)",
      "The line 'Friends aren't required to invite each other to every single thing' is a bit more direct/blunt than the ground truth's softer approach, though still balanced with empathy"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and consistent use of first-person perspective ('I think you could', 'I'd try not to overthink') creates an authentic conversational tone that feels like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of the blue heart emoji (💙), while within acceptable limits (0-1), differs from the ground truth's emoji-free approach and slightly shifts the tone toward being more explicitly 'supportive' rather than casually conversational",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure paragraph structure throughout with no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting, matching Claude's conversational prose style perfectly"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses one emoji (💙) while ground truth uses none",
      "Employs significantly more first-person language ('I think', 'I'd try') compared to ground truth's more imperative/second-person approach ('Try not to', 'Have you thought about')",
      "Follow-up question focuses on spontaneity vs. planned nature rather than ground truth's question about closeness to the friend group",
      "Slightly more extensive advice section including the 'friends aren't required' perspective which is more direct than ground truth's softer framing"
