    "strengths": [
      "Opens with warm validation and relatable metaphor ('digital equivalent of tripping in public') that normalizes the embarrassment",
      "Uses casual, age-appropriate language ('deep-like', 'risky business, lol', 'literally everyone') that feels authentic to teen conversation",
      "Provides specific, realistic platform advice (Instagram notification behavior, covering up with recent likes) that's immediately actionable"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missing a follow-up question at the end - Claude nearly always ends with a natural question to continue the conversation, but this ends with a statement ('We've all been there!')",
      "Over-formatted with bold headers and bullet points ('**Damage control options:**', '**Unlike immediately**') making it feel more like an instruction manual than a conversational text",
      "Lacks first-person connection language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I'm here if you need to talk') that makes Claude's responses feel personally engaged"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The validating opening that immediately normalizes the experience by comparing it to something embarrassing but universal, acknowledging the 'mortifying' feeling while reassuring that it happens to everyone",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of any follow-up question to invite further conversation - this is a signature element of Claude's teen support approach that creates ongoing dialogue",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 3,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "Uses heavy formatting with bold headers ('**Damage control options:**') and bold bullet starters, making it more structured and list-like than the ground truth. Claude's response uses bullets but with less aggressive formatting and more flowing prose between sections."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "No closing question to continue the conversation (ground truth asks 'What kind of post was it?')",
      "Uses 💀 emoji at the end which is less warm/supportive than Claude's 😊 and creates a slightly different tone",
      "More impersonal formatting with bold headers and bullet lists compared to Claude's conversational paragraph flow with lighter bullet usage",
      "Lacks the 'thumb betrays you' type of vivid, empathetic imagery that makes the ground truth feel more connected to the physical experience"
