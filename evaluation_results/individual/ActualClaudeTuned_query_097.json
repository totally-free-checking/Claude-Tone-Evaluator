    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think the kindest thing you can do', 'I'd avoid making up excuses') which creates authentic connection",
      "Natural prose flow with zero bullet points or formatting - reads like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Validates the awkwardness immediately with relatable language ('Ugh, that's so awkward', 'We've all been in that uncomfortable spot')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses an emoji (😅) while ground truth uses none; per instructions emojis should be 0 unless asked, though 1 is acceptable if natural",
      "Ends with two distinct questions rather than one natural follow-up question, making it slightly less conversational than ground truth",
      "Ground truth emphasizes relationship closeness ('How close are you with this person?') while evaluated focuses on method of asking, which is less central to the advice given"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person prose delivery with specific actionable phrases ('I'm really flattered, but I just see us as friends') and casual contractions that sound like genuine advice from a supportive peer",
    "least_claude_like": "The emoji usage at the beginning - while only one and appropriately placed, Claude's ground truth response achieves warmth through words alone without emoji reliance",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs rather than being listed out."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks about relationship closeness to tailor advice; evaluated asks about how they asked out and worry about aftermath",
      "Ground truth explicitly states 'It's totally normal to feel a bit awkward' while evaluated uses 'this happens all the time' - slightly less direct emotional validation",
      "Ground truth ends with single question about feelings; evaluated asks two questions at once"
