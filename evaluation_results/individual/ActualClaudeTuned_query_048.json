    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm sorry', 'I totally get', 'I think') which creates genuine connection",
      "Provides specific, actionable script for the teen to use with family ('I know you don't mean it this way...') making advice immediately usable",
      "Maintains pure prose format with natural conversational flow using contractions and casual phrasing ('gonna', 'spelled out')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Includes an emoji (😅) when the user didn't request one and ground truth uses none, slightly violating the 'don't use unless asked' guideline",
      "Heavier emphasis on practical solutions compared to ground truth, which focused more on pure validation and venting space",
      "Slightly longer than ground truth (4 paragraphs vs 3), making it a bit less concise though still readable"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person voice and specific actionable advice with realistic scripting for family conversations",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of an emoji without being asked, whereas Claude's ground truth response achieves warmth through words alone",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullets, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within paragraphs rather than being listed out."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses primarily on validation and inviting venting without offering specific scripts, while evaluated response provides concrete dialogue to use",
      "Ground truth is more concise (3 short paragraphs) and validation-heavy, while evaluated response balances advice and validation over 4 paragraphs",
      "Ground truth uses no emojis; evaluated response uses one (😅)",
      "Ground truth ends with open-ended 'Want to vent?' while evaluated response asks specific diagnostic question about who is making the comparisons"
