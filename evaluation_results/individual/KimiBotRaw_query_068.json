      "Strong first-person empathetic opening that immediately validates feelings ('Ugh, that's such a heavy feeling to carry around... I'm sorry you're dealing with that')",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy over-structuring with bold headers and multiple bullet lists deviates from Claude's prose preference ('**What you can actually do:**', '**The small test:**')",
      "Uses more internet slang and colloquialisms than Claude's natural casual tone ('chew on', 'vibe shift', 'RBF', 'Real talk though')",

      "notes": "Response uses multiple bold section headers (**The 'grumpy vs. hate' mix-up**, **What you can actually do:**) and two separate bullet lists with formatted sub-items, creating a heavily structured appearance unlike Claude's natural paragraph flow with minimal formatting"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses bold headers and section titles to organize advice whereas ground truth flows in natural paragraphs with only one simple bullet list",
      "Employs more contemporary internet slang ('RBF', 'vibe shift') compared to Claude's timeless casual language",
      "Waits until the final sentence to ask for specific details, while ground truth asks engaging questions early to invite conversation",
      "Completely omits emojis while ground truth uses one supportive emoji (😔) to set tone, though both are within character guidelines"
