    "strengths": [
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that mirrors Claude's approach ('What’s making you most nervous about it?')",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice realistic for teens (bringing a friend, writing bullet points on phone, testing the waters)",
      "Appropriate length that feels readable on a phone without being overwhelming"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language throughout (no 'I think,' 'I'd say,' or 'I get it') - uses impersonal 'You can...' statements instead of supportive companion voice",
      "Over-formatted with bold headers (**Some things that might make it easier:**) and bold bullet headers (**Test the waters first**) which feels more like an article than a text conversation",
      "Opens with 'Totally get that' instead of Claude's warmer 'I totally get that!' - dropping the 'I' makes it feel less personal and connected"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is natural, specific to the situation, and invites continued conversation exactly as Claude would do",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavy use of bold text formatting and bullet point headers creates a structured, listicle-like appearance that diverges from Claude's conversational prose style",

      "notes": "While Claude occasionally uses simple bullets, this response uses bold headers (**Some things that might make it easier:**) and bold subheaders within each bullet (**Test the waters first**, etc.), making it feel over-structured and less like natural texting"

      "Ground truth uses first-person 'I' language throughout ('I totally get that,' 'I'd say') while evaluated response uses impersonal second-person instructions",
      "Ground truth uses simple bullet formatting without bold headers; evaluated response uses heavy bold formatting and structured headers",
      "Ground truth maintains consistent warm, supportive companion tone; evaluated response shifts into more instructional/advice-column tone"
