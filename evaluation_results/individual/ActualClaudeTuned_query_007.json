    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd definitely', 'I totally get') creating a personal, supportive voice",
      "Pure prose format with natural conversational flow - reads like a text from a supportive friend rather than a structured guide",
      "Specific, actionable scripts for both contacting the partner and emailing the teacher that a teen could literally copy and paste"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Doesn't explicitly address self-care boundaries like the Ground Truth does (e.g., 'don't kill yourself trying to do two people's work overnight')",
      "Could more explicitly mention documenting communication attempts for proof, which is important practical protection for the teen",
      "Slightly less emphasis on the immediate time pressure/damage control aspect given 'due tomorrow' urgency"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person conversational tone with phrases like 'I totally get why you're stressed' and 'I'd definitely email your teacher' - it sounds like a real person sharing their honest perspective rather than an AI giving instructions",
    "least_claude_like": "The follow-up question focuses on the partner's character history rather than immediately offering to help strategize the work itself, which is slightly less solution-oriented than Claude's typical approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph format with no bullet points or headers, which actually aligns perfectly with the character profile instruction to write in 'natural prose paragraphs (NOT bullet-heavy)' - even more so than the Ground Truth which uses bullet lists"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses bullet points with headers for quick scanning; Response uses flowing prose paragraphs",
      "Ground Truth explicitly advises not to overwork/do two people's work; Response focuses more on communication strategy",
      "Ground Truth asks about the project type to offer specific help; Response asks about the partner's character/flakiness pattern",
      "Ground Truth emphasizes documenting contact attempts more explicitly"
