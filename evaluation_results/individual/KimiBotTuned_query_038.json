    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points - flows naturally like a text conversation",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact phrasing to use with counselors ('I'm feeling behind and I don't know what to pick—can you look at my options with me?')",
      "Uses appropriate casual teen language ('wreck your stress level,' 'drowning,' 'so heavy') without being cringe"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think,' 'I'd say,' 'I get it') which makes it feel like an article rather than a supportive friend talking",
      "Jumps to practical advice too quickly without sufficient emotional validation - only 2 sentences of validation before launching into solutions",
      "Uses impersonal constructions like 'It also helps to...' instead of 'I'd suggest...' or 'I think you should...' which creates distance rather than connection"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format with no bullet points and conversational flow - this reads like a text message rather than a structured guide",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective and immediate pivot to solutions. Claude would validate more deeply and ask questions before offering specific class selection strategies",

      "Ground truth asks exploratory questions before giving advice; evaluated response gives extensive advice immediately after brief validation",

      "Ground truth ends with encouragement and validation; evaluated response ends with questions without reaffirming support"
