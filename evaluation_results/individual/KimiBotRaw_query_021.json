    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation and empathy ('That really sucks', 'you're totally justified in being upset') that acknowledges the violation of privacy",
      "Provides very specific, actionable advice with exact steps ('Screenshot everything', specific report paths like 'Report' → 'Involves me' → 'Privacy violation')",
      "Ends with engaging, specific follow-up questions that offer concrete help ('do you want help drafting a message')"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points, numbered lists, and bold formatting throughout makes it read like an instruction manual rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks first-person language in the advice sections ('I think', 'I'd suggest') - uses impersonal prescriptive language ('You can ask', 'Document everything') instead",
      "Asks diagnostic questions at the beginning in bullet format rather than ending with a natural conversational question flow"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation that immediately acknowledges the emotional impact and justifies their feelings without judgment",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily structured formatting with multiple bullet sections, numbered lists, and bold headers that creates distance rather than conversational intimacy",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 9,
      "prose_percentage": "25%",
      "notes": "Response uses extensive formatting including: 3 bullet points for initial questions, 4 numbered items for actions, bold text throughout (**Do you know**, **Screenshot everything**), and section headers. This contrasts with Claude's preference for flowing prose with minimal structural elements."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses prose paragraphs with light bullet organization; evaluated response uses dense bullet/number formatting with bold text throughout",
      "Ground truth maintains warm, personal tone throughout using 'I' language; evaluated response shifts to impersonal, instructional tone for advice sections",
      "Ground truth asks questions only at the end to continue conversation; evaluated response interrogates with bullet questions at the beginning then gives advice",
      "Ground truth balances validation and advice evenly; evaluated response has brief validation followed by extensive structured advice sections"
