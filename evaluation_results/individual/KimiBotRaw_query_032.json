      "Opens with strong validation and empathy: 'Ugh, that's such a rough spot to be in—the silent treatment... is honestly one of the most stressful things to navigate' mirrors Claude's warmth",
      "Follow-up questions are natural and specific: 'How long has this been going on? And do you have a gut feeling...' shows genuine interest in continuing the conversation",
      "Practical advice is realistic and teen-appropriate, including specific script suggestions like 'Hey, I'm picking up some weird vibes and I care about you'"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bold headers and bullet points ('**They're processing.**', '**What you can actually do:**') creates a structured, article-like format instead of Claude's conversational prose",
      "Lacks first-person language entirely - no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it' which makes it feel impersonal and analytical compared to Claude's ground truth which uses 'I'm getting the sense' and 'I do'",
      "Over-categorized with four bold headers functioning as bullet points plus additional dash bullets, making it feel like a self-help list rather than a friend texting"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and the natural, specific follow-up questions at the end that invite the teen to share more details",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses natural first-person language ('I'm getting', 'I do') while evaluated response uses entirely third-person analytical tone ('Sometimes people', 'They could be')",
      "Ground truth is primarily prose with minimal bullets; evaluated response uses bold headers and extensive bullet formatting creating a listicle structure",
      "Ground truth is concise (2 paragraphs + 3 short bullets + 1 paragraph); evaluated response is significantly longer with categorized sections that feel more like a guide than a conversation"
