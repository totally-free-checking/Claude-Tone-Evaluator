      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a friend",
      "Specific, realistic script suggestions like 'Hey, you’ve felt kinda off over text lately—are we good?' that give the teen exact words to use",
      "Strong emotional validation opening with 'Ugh, that’s the worst' and acknowledging the anxiety spiral of 'Did I do something?'"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language from the bot's perspective (missing 'I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') which would make it feel more personally connected",
      "The phrase 'I'm here' appears only within the suggested script for the user to say, rather than the bot explicitly offering 'I'm here if you need to talk'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose paragraph structure that flows like a conversation rather than a list of tips, perfectly matching the 'texting with a supportive friend' vibe",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective statements ('I think', 'I'd say') makes it slightly less personally engaged than Claude's typical approach, though the tone remains warm",

      "Evaluated response includes one emoji (😅) while ground truth uses none",

      "Evaluated response embeds specific phrasing suggestions within prose while ground truth lists them as bullet options"
