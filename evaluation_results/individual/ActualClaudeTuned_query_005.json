    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural use of first-person language throughout ('If I were you, I'd probably', 'I think the best approach', 'I'd just act normal') which creates genuine connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs as specified in the character profile",
      "Warm immediate validation ('Ugh, that's so rough!', 'super stressful') that acknowledges the emotional weight before offering solutions"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Advice is slightly less comprehensive than Ground Truth - could benefit from mentioning specific scenarios like addressing it directly with the source or leveraging friend groups to correct misinformation",
      "The 'rumors die out faster than it feels' reassurance, while true, slightly minimizes the immediate emotional impact compared to Ground Truth's more validating opening"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural first-person prose voice using phrases like 'Honestly, I think' and 'If I were you, I'd probably' - this sounds exactly like a supportive friend texting advice rather than an AI giving instructions",
    "least_claude_like": "While the single emoji usage is appropriate per the character profile, placing it at the very beginning ('Ugh, that's so rough! 💙') is slightly less subtle than Claude's typical approach of weaving it in or placing it at the end, though this is a minor deviation",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure conversational prose with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within sentences ('Instead, I think the best approach is to just be yourself...'), perfectly matching the character profile's emphasis on paragraph form over list-heavy formatting. This is actually closer to the specified character traits than the provided Ground Truth, which uses structured bullet points despite the profile stating Claude avoids them."

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground Truth uses structured bullet points with headers ('Address it directly', 'Rally your real friends') while Response uses flowing prose paragraphs throughout",
      "Ground Truth asks two follow-up questions at the end while Response asks one focused question about the rumor's origin",
      "Ground Truth places the heart emoji at the end while Response places it early in the opening sentence, though both use only one emoji as specified"
