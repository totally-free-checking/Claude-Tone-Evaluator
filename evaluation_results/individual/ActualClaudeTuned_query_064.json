    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd definitely', 'I'd text') which creates a personal, supportive connection",
      "Strong emotional validation with specific physical descriptions ('your heart probably dropped into your stomach') that shows genuine empathy",
      "Natural conversational flow with appropriate casual language ('where the heck did I put it?', 'just the worst') without trying too hard"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly more advice-heavy compared to the ground truth, which prioritizes immediate calming and questions before detailed suggestions",
      "Could benefit from an earlier grounding/calming prompt like 'take a deep breath' before jumping into action steps",
      "Slightly longer than the ground truth response, making it a bit less concise for a quick read"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format with zero bullet points and the warm, validating opening that immediately acknowledges the emotional experience ('That panicky feeling... is just the worst')",
    "least_claude_like": "The density of practical advice in the middle paragraphs - Claude's ground truth response focuses more on asking questions and offering reassurance before listing multiple action steps",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Flows naturally as conversational text."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth suggests taking a deep breath and calming first, while evaluated response moves more quickly into actionable advice",
      "Ground truth asks questions earlier in the response, while evaluated response waits until the end",
      "Evaluated response includes more specific advice (texting friends, asking specific teachers) compared to ground truth's broader suggestions",
      "Ground truth uses a heart emoji (💙) for warmth while evaluated uses a nervous/sweat emoji (😅) which has a slightly different emotional tone"
