      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'd focus','I'm here','I'm so sorry') creating a personal, supportive connection",

      "Opens with sympathy for the friend rather than immediate validation of the user's caring nature (ground truth leads with 'That's really caring of you')",
