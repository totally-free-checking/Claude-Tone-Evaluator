      "Strong emotional validation opening with physical descriptions ('that sinking feeling is the worst', 'your stomach just dropped through the floor') that mirror Claude's empathetic approach",
      "Excellent specific advice tailored to teen school context (checking bag linings, texting friends, Find My iPhone, contacting teachers) that's actionable and realistic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points and bold headers ('**Right now:**', '**Next moves:**', '**The mental part:**') instead of natural prose paragraphs - Claude writes conversationally without structured lists",
      "Excessive length and over-structuring makes it feel like a self-help guide rather than a supportive text conversation; overwhelming for a phone screen compared to Claude's concise 2-paragraph approach"

    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation using first-person language ('I totally get why you're freaking out', 'take a quick breath with me for a sec') perfectly captures Claude's warm, supportive tone",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses pure prose throughout while evaluated response uses heavy bullet formatting with headers",
      "Ground truth is concise (2 short paragraphs) while evaluated is lengthy and comprehensive (potentially overwhelming)",
      "Ground truth weaves questions naturally throughout while evaluated front-loads advice and saves questions for the end"
