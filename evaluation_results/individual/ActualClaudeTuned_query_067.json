    "strengths": [
      "Immediate emotional validation with 'Ugh, that's so overwhelming!' that mirrors Claude's empathetic opening style",
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think it's totally fair') creating a personal, supportive voice",
      "Specific, actionable script suggestion ('I know college is important, but I'm still figuring out what I'm interested in...') that gives teens exact words to use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Follow-up question focuses on logistical specifics ('Are they pushing for specific schools') rather than emotional experience ('What part...stresses you out'), making it slightly less feeling-focused than Claude's approach",
      "Advice leans toward practical activities (clubs, classes) rather than Claude's balance of practical and playful/lighthearted options (college movies)"

      "Uses one emoji (😅) while ground truth uses none, though still within acceptable 0-1 range",
      "Suggested coping strategies focus on structured activities (clubs, classes) rather than Claude's mix of practical and playful options (college movies)",
      "Follow-up question targets specific parental behaviors rather than emotional experience",
      "Employs slightly more first-person opinion language ('I think it's totally fair') compared to ground truth's second-person suggestions ('You could try')"
