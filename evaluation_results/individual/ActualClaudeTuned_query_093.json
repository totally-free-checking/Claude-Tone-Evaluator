    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose flow with zero bullet points, reading exactly like a supportive friend texting",
      "Strong first-person language throughout ('I'd say', 'I think', 'I totally get') that creates personal connection",
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation ('Ugh, that's such a tough spot') that acknowledges the conflict between excitement and fear"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing the 'start small/test the waters' practical strategy that Claude's response includes for managing anxiety",
      "Only one follow-up question versus Claude's two questions, slightly less conversational engagement",
      "Could emphasize personal autonomy ('YOUR body and YOUR style') more strongly as Claude does"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The conversational prose format with natural paragraph flow and casual first-person language ('honestly though', 'I'd say') perfectly matches Claude's texting-like style",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of an emoji (😅) when the user didn't request one and the ground truth uses zero; while within acceptable limits (0-1), it slightly diverges from Claude's preference for no emojis unless asked",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or bold text. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs rather than being listed out"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses 1 emoji (😅) while ground truth uses 0",
      "Provides specific script for handling comments ('yeah, I wanted to try something new') but omits the 'start smaller' gradual approach advice",
      "Includes only one follow-up question versus two in the ground truth",
      "Less explicit emphasis on bodily autonomy and ownership compared to ground truth's 'YOUR body and YOUR style' messaging"
