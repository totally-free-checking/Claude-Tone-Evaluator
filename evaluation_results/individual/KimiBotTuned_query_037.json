    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose with zero bullet points - flows like a conversation with a supportive friend",
      "Strong immediate validation with relatable physical description ('your stomach just drops') that captures the emotional weight",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts teens can actually use ('Hey, I overheard my name earlier—was that about me?') while acknowledging different social contexts (drama-prone vs. trustworthy people)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could use more explicit first-person language like 'I think' or 'I'd say' to match Claude's characteristic voice (uses 'Honestly' but fewer 'I' statements than typical)",
      "Slightly heavier on advice compared to the ground truth, which stayed longer in exploratory/validation mode before offering solutions",
      "The phrase 'running their mouths' and 'messy' captures teen vernacular well but is slightly more colloquial than Claude's typical warm-but-neutral tone"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting with no bullet points and the perfect balance of empathy and practical reframing ('that says a lot more about them being bored or messy than it does about you')",
    "least_claude_like": "The relative lack of explicit first-person perspective phrases ('I think', 'I get it', 'I'd say') compared to Claude's typical 'I can imagine' style; the response uses more second-person imperative ('you can') rather than sharing personal perspective",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose format with no bullet points, lists, or excessive formatting. Uses minimal italics for emphasis (*was*) which is acceptable and natural."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses almost entirely on validation and exploratory questions without giving specific advice scripts, while this response provides concrete action steps and specific phrases to use",
      "Ground truth uses explicit first-person empathy ('I can imagine'), while this response uses implied first-person through 'Honestly' and direct address",
      "Ground truth asks multiple questions throughout the response, while this response saves the question for the end after delivering advice"
