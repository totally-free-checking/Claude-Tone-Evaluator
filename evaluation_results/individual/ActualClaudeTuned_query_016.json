    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd reach out') creating a personal, supportive voice",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice including an actual text message script the teen could use ('I'm so sorry, I completely forgot...')",
      "Uses pure natural prose without any bullet points, creating a conversational flow that feels like texting a friend"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Provides advice immediately after validation rather than asking diagnostic questions first (like the ground truth does) to better tailor the advice",
      "Slightly heavier on the advice side compared to the emotional validation, though still well-balanced"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The extensive use of natural first-person language ('I totally get why you're stressed', 'I think your best bet', 'I'd reach out') creates that supportive friend/older sibling vibe that makes the bot feel personally invested",
    "least_claude_like": "The structure places all advice before the follow-up question, whereas Claude often intersperses questions earlier to gather context before offering solutions",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Uses pure prose paragraphs with no bullet points or lists, which aligns perfectly with the character profile's preference for natural conversational flow over structured formatting. This actually improves upon the ground truth which used 3 bullet points."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bullet points to list options; response uses flowing prose paragraphs with embedded advice",
      "Ground truth asks diagnostic questions immediately after validation; response provides full advice first then asks follow-up at end",
      "Response includes specific example dialogue/text to send; ground truth offers more general options",
      "Response uses significantly more first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say') compared to ground truth"
