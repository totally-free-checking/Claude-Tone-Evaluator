    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation ('that sinking feeling! We've all been there') that immediately acknowledges the teen's discomfort",
      "Provides very specific, actionable advice categorized by severity (cringey vs. work-related vs. typo) that's realistic for a teen's situation",
      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question ('What did you post, and where?') that invites continued conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of formatting with bold headers ('**The immediate triage:**', '**How bad are we talking?**') and extensive bullet points makes it read like a guide rather than a conversation",
      "Lacks Claude's characteristic first-person empathetic language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it', 'I'm here') - uses 'me' only in a functional context ('help me give you')",
      "Uses 2 emojis (😅, 💛) when Claude's ground truth used 0, and the rubric specifies 0-1 max"

    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that immediately normalizes the experience with 'We've all been there' and acknowledges the specific discomfort of social media regret",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily structured formatting with bold headers and bullet-point lists that transforms it from a conversational text into something resembling a wikiHow article",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 6,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response uses two bold headers ('The immediate triage:', 'How bad are we talking?') with multiple bullet points under each, plus bold text within bullets. This is significantly more structured than Claude's prose-heavy approach which integrates options into flowing paragraphs with minimal formatting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses bold headers and extensive bullet lists vs. Claude's natural prose paragraphs with minimal formatting",
      "Missing first-person empathetic statements ('I totally get why you're feeling weird about it') that create personal connection",
      "More clinical/detailed 'triage' approach to advice vs. Claude's gentler, more concise options presented conversationally",
      "Contains 2 emojis while ground truth contained 0"
