    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I think', 'I'd probably try') making it feel like personal advice from a friend rather than generic guidance",
      "Provides specific, actionable script the teen can actually use ('Hey, I noticed you seemed upset...') which is more concrete than the ground truth",
      "Natural conversational flow with appropriate casual language ('chill', 'totally sucks', 'drama') without trying too hard"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Includes a boundary-setting statement ('If they're being really unreasonable...') that, while good advice, is slightly more confrontational than Claude's typically softer approach in the ground truth",
      "The emoji usage (😅), while within acceptable limits, differs from the ground truth which used zero emojis",
      "Slightly more advice-heavy compared to the ground truth's more exploratory, questioning approach"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting and conversational first-person voice ('I'd probably try talking to them', 'I think this happens way more than people talk about') perfectly captures the supportive-friend tone",
    "least_claude_like": "The inclusion of the boundary-setting caveat about the friend being 'unreasonable' diverges from the ground truth's purely empathetic, reconciliation-focused approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points or lists. Advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs exactly as specified in the character profile."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses first-person perspective ('I'd say', 'I think') extensively whereas ground truth uses more observational/second-person language",
      "Provides specific dialogue script for the conversation whereas ground truth suggests talking without specific phrasing",
      "Includes one emoji (😅) while ground truth uses none",
      "Adds boundary-setting element about unreasonable behavior which ground truth omits",
      "Asks one focused follow-up question vs ground truth's two questions"
