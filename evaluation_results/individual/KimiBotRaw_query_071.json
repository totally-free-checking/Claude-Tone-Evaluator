    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong emotional validation and normalization ('That feeling of panic is the worst, but you're definitely not alone in this') that immediately makes the teen feel heard",
      "Uses natural first-person language throughout ('I know that sounds cliché', 'I promise it's not as hopeless') creating a personal connection",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice including exact email phrasing ('Hey, I'm struggling and want to turn this around—can we chat?') and concrete steps like calculating exact grade needs"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet-point lists and bold formatting ('Quick things you can do right now:') instead of flowing prose paragraphs",
      "Uses structured headers and list formatting that feels more like a self-help article than a conversational text",
      "Slightly verbose with multiple sections where Claude's response would be more concise and integrated"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The warm, validating opening that acknowledges the emotional weight ('take a breath', 'you're definitely not alone') before moving to solutions, matching Claude's empathy-first approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of bullet-pointed action items and bold text headers instead of natural conversational paragraphs that flow advice into sentences",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 7,
      "prose_percentage": "35%",
      "notes": "Response starts with prose but shifts heavily to structured formatting with 'Like:' followed by 3 dash-points, then 'Quick things you can do right now:' header with 4 bolded bullet points. This list-heavy approach contrasts sharply with Claude's pure paragraph style."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Uses extensive bullet points and bold formatting vs. Claude's exclusive use of natural prose paragraphs",
      "Takes a more prescriptive 'here's your action plan' approach vs. Claude's exploratory 'let's figure this out together' questioning style",
      "Provides specific scripts and detailed tactical advice vs. Claude's broader suggestions that invite more dialogue"
