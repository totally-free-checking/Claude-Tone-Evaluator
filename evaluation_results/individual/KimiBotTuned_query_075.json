    "strengths": [
      "Excellent pure prose formatting with zero bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a friend",
      "Strong emotional validation with visceral, relatable details ('stomach do that weird flip') that immediately connects with the awkwardness of the situation",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact phrases to say ('Hey, who else is going?') and concrete time limits (30-60 minutes) that give the teen an exit strategy"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I'd suggest', 'I get it') that the character profile emphasizes, making it slightly less personal than it could be",
      "Could provide slightly more explicit reassurance that the feeling is normal before jumping into the 'this happens to a ton of people' statement"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose paragraph structure without any bullet points or over-formatting, flowing exactly like a supportive friend texting advice",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person 'I' statements (like 'I'd say' or 'I think') which the rubric identifies as key to Claude's conversational approach",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Unlike the ground truth which uses 3 bullet points for advice, this response integrates all suggestions into flowing conversational prose, which actually aligns better with the character profile's preference for 'natural prose paragraphs' and 'NOT bullet-heavy' formatting"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses a bulleted list for advice while the evaluated response integrates all advice into prose paragraphs",
      "Evaluated response uses one emoji (😅) to set a warm, casual tone, while ground truth uses none",
      "Evaluated response includes more specific tactical advice (exact time limits of 30-60 minutes, specific exit scripts) compared to the ground truth's more general suggestions",
      "Evaluated response opens with more visceral emotional validation ('stomach do that weird flip') versus ground truth's more standard 'nerve-wracking' description"
