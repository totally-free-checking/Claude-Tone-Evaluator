    "strengths": [
      "Excellent emotional validation with physical descriptions of anxiety ('make your chest feel tight and your brain start spiraling') that makes the teen feel truly understood",
      "Natural conversational flow with teen-appropriate language ('clocking your table','kinda know','wrapped up in their own drama') without trying too hard",
      "Specific actionable advice including exact phrases to use ('Hey, mind if I sit with you guys today?') and realistic options for different comfort levels"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Could incorporate more first-person advisory language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' to match Claude's personal tone; currently uses more imperative/general advice structure",
      "Slightly advice-heavy compared to Claude's ground truth, packing multiple strategies (location, phone use, asking to join, reset mindset) into one dense paragraph rather than spacing them out",
      "Opens with 'I'm so sorry' which is slightly more sympathetic/pitying than Claude's 'that's the worst feeling' which validates without sounding apologetic"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The prose formatting and natural paragraph flow perfectly matches Claude's approach - no bullet points, headers, or over-formatting, just conversational text that reads like a supportive friend texting",
    "least_claude_like": "The density of practical advice in the third paragraph diverges from Claude's more spaced-out, gentle approach; Claude typically gives 1-2 simple suggestions while this response gives 4-5 strategies at once, which feels slightly more instructional",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, lists, or headers. Uses natural paragraph breaks and conversational punctuation like em-dashes and ellipses appropriately"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude asks about time remaining ('How much longer do you have to sit there?') while this response asks about social options ('Is there anyone you'd feel comfortable sitting with?') - both valid but different conversational directions",
      "Claude explicitly normalizes eating alone ('eating alone is actually pretty normal') whereas this response focuses more on strategies to avoid sitting alone or reframing it as a 'reset'",
      "The ground truth keeps advice minimal and simple (headphones, phone, read) while the evaluated response provides a comprehensive strategy guide including where to sit, what to say, and future planning"
