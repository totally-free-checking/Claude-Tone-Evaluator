    "strengths": [
      "Opens with strong validation using 'Ugh, that's so frustrating' and casual language like 'crappy' that matches teen speech patterns",
      "Uses first-person language naturally throughout, especially in the suggested script ('I'm not trying to argue') which makes it feel personal",
      "Ends with a specific, engaging follow-up question that invites the teen to share their side of the story"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy imbalance toward practical advice over emotional validation - provides a lengthy script and escalation steps (dean/counselor/parent) whereas Claude focused primarily on venting and being heard",
      "The advice paragraph is dense and somewhat overwhelming with multiple options (email, after class, witnesses, parents) packed into one long sentence with semicolons",
      "Less empathetic depth than ground truth - doesn't acknowledge the specific emotional weight of unfairness as deeply before jumping to solutions"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The conversational opening and natural use of first-person language and contractions ('that's', 'I'm', 'it's') creates an authentic, friendly tone that feels like texting with a supportive peer",
    "least_claude_like": "The response jumps quickly into detailed, multi-step practical advice including specific dialogue scripts and escalation pathways (bringing in parents/deans), whereas Claude's character prioritizes emotional validation and venting over immediate problem-solving for unfair disciplinary situations",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response maintains pure prose format with no bullet points or headers, though the advice section uses semicolons to separate multiple suggestions which creates a slightly list-like rhythm within the paragraph"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses on emotional validation and venting ('it might help to talk through what happened'), while evaluated response focuses heavily on actionable steps to dispute the detention",
      "Evaluated response provides specific scripted dialogue and mentions escalation to parents/administrators, which is more confrontational than Claude's gentle approach",
      "Ground truth asks open-ended questions about the situation immediately after validation, while evaluated response gives extensive advice before asking for details"
