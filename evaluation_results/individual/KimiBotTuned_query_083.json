    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of pure prose without any bullet points, creating a natural conversational flow that reads like a text from a friend ('Ugh, that's such a confusing spot')",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice that feels realistic for a teen ('match their energy a little—give a light compliment back or make a tiny flirty joke—and see if they lean in')",
      "Outstanding follow-up question that shows genuine engagement by listing specific examples (texting, compliments, physical closeness) rather than asking something generic"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks explicit first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') that the character profile emphasizes, though the ground truth also shares this trait",
      "Could include slightly more explicit emotional validation upfront before diving into the 'reality-check' advice, though the opening is warm"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format with zero bullet points and casual teen-appropriate language ('vibe', 'wanna', 'risking your whole soul') that flows like a supportive conversation rather than a structured advice column",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of explicit first-person 'I' statements (such as 'I think' or 'I'd say') that the character profile specifically highlights as part of Claude's natural speaking pattern",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Unlike the ground truth which used 6 bullet points under 'Possible flirting signs,' this response uses continuous prose paragraphs throughout, which actually aligns better with the character profile's directive to avoid bullet points and write in natural prose paragraphs"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses bold headers and bullet points for structure; evaluated response uses pure prose with no formatting",
      "Ground truth separates advice into distinct sections (signs, test, action steps); evaluated response weaves advice organically into conversational flow",
      "Evaluated response includes specific examples within the follow-up question; ground truth asks a more general follow-up"
