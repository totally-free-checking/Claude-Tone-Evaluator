      "Completely lacks first-person language ('I think', 'I get it', 'I'd say') that makes Claude's character feel like a real supportive person talking to you",
      "Over-structured with bold headers and heavy bullet formatting that reads like a self-help article rather than a text conversation",
      "Minimal emotional validation before jumping into strategic advice - only one brief 'Ugh, that's the worst' before 'here's the real talk'",
      "Too long and overwhelming - feels like reading a guide rather than getting support from a friend"

    "most_claude_like": "The practical advice quality and specificity of the suggested phrases teens could use",

      "Ground truth validates feelings throughout; evaluated response quickly pivots to strategic 'gray rock' methodology and documentation advice",
