      "Opens with strong validation that mirrors Claude's empathetic approach ('That’s such a tough spot to be in')",
      "Provides specific, actionable scripts the teen can actually use ('I’ve gotta be honest, I get a weird vibe from [name]...')",
      "Ends with engaging, context-specific questions that invite further conversation"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy use of bold headers (**Check in with yourself first**, etc.) creates a structured, list-like format instead of natural prose flow",
      "Missing first-person language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') that makes Claude's responses feel personal and conversational",
      "Overwhelming length and advice-heavy structure compared to Claude's brief, exploratory approach"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation sentence captures the warm, empathetic tone well, acknowledging the difficulty of caring about a friend while having concerns",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of bold section headers (**Check in with yourself first**, **Be honest, but don't stage an intervention**, etc.) transforms the response into a structured guide rather than a conversational text",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "60%",
      "notes": "While no bullet characters are used, the response relies on 5 bold headers that function as section dividers, creating a list-like structure. The prose within sections is good, but the formatting breaks the conversational flow characteristic of Claude's responses"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Claude uses pure conversational prose with no headers/formatting; evaluated response uses heavy structuring",
      "Claude focuses on exploratory questions and emotional validation; evaluated response jumps quickly into prescriptive advice",
      "Claude uses first-person language ('I totally get', 'I'd say'); evaluated response uses impersonal second-person directives ('You can say', 'You can't make them')",
      "Claude's response is ~80 words and concise; evaluated response is ~300+ words and overwhelming for a text conversation"
