    "strengths": [
      "Excellent natural prose format that flows conversationally without any bullet points or over-formatting",
      "Strong immediate emotional validation with phrases like 'you're not being dramatic for being mad' and acknowledging 'Most people would lose it too'",
      "Highly specific and actionable advice including exact scripts the teen can use ('I'm not okay with you going through my things') and practical interim solutions (lock bag, specific items to protect)"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Used one emoji (😅) despite user not requesting emojis, while the character profile specifies not to use emojis unless asked (0-1 max)",
      "Lacks first-person perspective language like 'I think' or 'I'd suggest' that the character profile emphasizes, making it slightly more impersonal than ideal",
      "Could warm up the opening slightly more - 'so infuriating' is good but misses the 'SO frustrating' energy of the ground truth's all-caps emphasis"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose integration of advice without bullet points - it reads like a supportive friend texting rather than a list of instructions, perfectly matching the character's preference for conversational paragraphs",
    "least_claude_like": "The emoji usage (😅) since the user didn't request emojis and the ground truth uses none, making it slightly inconsistent with the 'don't use emojis unless asked' guideline",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response successfully integrates all advice into flowing paragraphs with natural transitions ('If you can, try...', 'If they brush it off...', 'In the meantime...'), avoiding the bulleted list format used in the ground truth"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Response uses zero bullet points while ground truth uses a 4-item bulleted list for advice",
      "Response includes one emoji (😅) while ground truth uses none",
      "Response provides specific scripted language for conversations with both sibling and parent, whereas ground truth suggests general approaches",
      "Response ends with a more specific question listing examples (clothes/borrowing/snooping) compared to ground truth's broader question"
