      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get,' 'I think,' 'I'm just') creating a personal, supportive connection",
      "Integrates advice naturally into prose paragraphs rather than using bullet points, creating better conversational flow",
      "Provides specific, actionable phrases the teen can actually use ('just be like cool and change the subject,' 'I'm just excited about this, I don't need advice')"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Includes slightly more psychological analysis about 'insecurities' compared to the ground truth's lighter 'they might not realize' approach, which could feel slightly more analytical",
      "Uses one emoji (😅) while the ground truth uses none; though within the 0-1 guideline, it's a minor deviation from the specific reference"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "Natural prose formatting without bullet points - the response flows as continuous conversational paragraphs rather than listing advice, which aligns perfectly with the character profile's emphasis on prose over structure",
    "least_claude_like": "The psychological framing about the friend's 'own insecurities' - while supportive, this is slightly heavier analysis than the ground truth's more neutral 'they might think they're being enthusiastic' framing",
