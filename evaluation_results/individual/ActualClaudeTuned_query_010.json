    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I'm so sorry', 'If I were you', 'I'd just try') which creates that supportive friend/sibling vibe",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice with exact phrasing ('ugh, my brain is clearly not awake yet!') that a teen could actually use in the moment",
      "Perfect prose formatting with natural paragraph flow - no bullets, headers, or over-structuring"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Opening validation is slightly less emphatic than Claude's typical 'Oh noooo!' with extended vowels and immediate 'I totally get' validation",
      "Could use more first-person empathy statements ('I get it', 'I understand that feeling') alongside the first-person advice statements",
      "The follow-up question is good but slightly less engaging than asking about the teacher's specific reaction"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format with zero bullet points and appropriate use of first-person advice language ('If I were you, I'd just try...')",
    "least_claude_like": "The opening lacks Claude's characteristic enthusiastic empathy burst ('Oh noooo!') and immediate 'I totally get' validation, starting instead with more standard sympathy",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses more immediate first-person validation ('I totally get') while evaluated uses first-person more for advice-giving ('If I were you')",
      "Evaluated response provides more specific actionable script/phrase for the teen to use, while ground truth focuses more on reassurance",
      "Ground truth ends with enthusiastic encouragement ('gonna survive this one! 💪') while evaluated ends with a more analytical question about overthinking"
