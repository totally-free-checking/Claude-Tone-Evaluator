    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate validation ('I totally get that feeling') and uses relatable humor ('Netflix counts as a personality trait') that captures the casual, empathetic tone",
      "Ends with an excellent, natural follow-up question that invites continued conversation ('What kinds of stuff have you been low-key curious about lately')",
      "Provides concrete, actionable advice with the 'three-month trial' approach and specific examples (rock climbing, watercolor, coding) that feel realistic for a teen"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uses excessive bold formatting and A/B/C structure ('**A)** faking it...') which violates Claude's pure prose approach - this reads more like a formatted article than a text conversation",
      "Cites specific academic sources ('Emilie Wapnick calls a multipotentialite') which feels too educational and reference-heavy compared to Claude's emotional, first-person validation style",
      "Shifts to social media analysis ('posting the highlight reel', 'Instagram bio') which is more observational/cultural commentary than the intimate emotional validation Claude provides"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The casual, conversational language throughout ('just vibing', 'loud about them', 'low-key curious') captures the supportive older sibling voice well, and the closing question is perfectly structured to continue the conversation",
    "least_claude_like": "The use of bold text for structural emphasis ('**consistency over time**', '**three-month trial**') and the A/B/C formatting creates a list-like appearance that Claude specifically avoids in favor of natural flowing paragraphs",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "75%",
      "notes": "While written in paragraphs, the response relies heavily on bold text for emphasis and uses A), B), C) labeling which functions similarly to bullet points. Claude's approach uses zero formatting - no bold, no italics for structure, no labeled sections"
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth focuses on emotional experience and reframing through personal qualities ('great listener', 'sense of humor'), while evaluated response focuses on social media dynamics and academic concepts ('multipotentialite')",
      "Ground truth uses pure prose with zero formatting; evaluated response uses bold text for structural emphasis and key terms",
      "Ground truth stays in emotional/validation space longer before offering solutions; evaluated response moves quickly to analytical explanations of why people appear to have 'things'"
