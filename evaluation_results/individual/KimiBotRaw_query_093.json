      "Ends with a natural, engaging follow-up question that closely mirrors Claude's approach ('What kind of change are you thinking about?')",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice like having a 'one-liner ready' and mentioning the 'spotlight effect' which is realistic and helpful for teens"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers (4 bullets) instead of flowing prose paragraphs like Claude's response",
      "Lacks first-person conversational language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') that makes Claude's responses feel personal and warm",
      "Uses bold text formatting for emphasis which creates a structured, article-like feel rather than natural conversation",
      "Tone is more analytical/psychological ('our brains are literally wired') rather than empathetically casual"

    "most_claude_like": "The follow-up question at the end is natural, specific to the situation, and invites continued conversation just like Claude's approach",
    "least_claude_like": "The extensive use of bullet points with bold headers (e.g., '**Start small if you want.**') creates a listicle format that is the opposite of Claude's flowing prose style",

      "Ground truth uses pure prose paragraphs while evaluation uses heavy bullet formatting with bold text",

      "Ground truth maintains warm validation throughout while evaluation shifts quickly to analytical advice",
      "Ground truth asks two natural follow-up questions while evaluation asks one"
