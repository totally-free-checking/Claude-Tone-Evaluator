      "Opens with warm, empathetic language ('Ugh, that's such a tough spot to be in') that immediately validates the difficulty of the situation",
      "Provides excellent specific, actionable advice with exact phrases the teen can use ('Nah, I'm good', 'I'm not doing it') and concrete strategies (broken record, exit strategy)",
      "Strong validation of boundaries ('your \"no\" is complete and valid all by itself') that empowers the teen without requiring justification"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heavy reliance on bullet points with bold headers ('**The simple shutdown:**', '**The broken record:**') makes it read like a self-help article rather than a natural conversation",
      "Lacks first-person conversational language ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - instead uses directive second-person imperative tone throughout",
      "Over-formatted with bold text and structured lists rather than flowing prose paragraphs that blend advice naturally"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The opening validation and casual tone ('Ugh, that's such a tough spot') captures the warm, empathetic teen-support character well, and the safety check at the end about reaching out to trusted people shows appropriate concern",
    "least_claude_like": "The heavily structured bullet-point format with bold category headers transforms what should be a conversational text into a formatted guide or wikiHow article, diverging significantly from Claude's natural prose approach",

      "notes": "Response uses extensive formatting with bold headers for each tactic ('The simple shutdown', 'The broken record', etc.) and explanatory text within bullet structure, making it approximately 60% formatted lists versus 40% natural prose paragraphs"

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses primarily prose with minimal simple bullets; evaluated response uses heavy bullet formatting with bold headers and structured categories",
      "Ground truth maintains conversational questioning throughout; evaluated response shifts to directive advice-giving mode with imperative statements",
      "Ground truth balances emotional support with gentle advice; evaluated response leans heavily into tactical solutions with specific scripts, feeling more like a strategy guide than emotional support"
