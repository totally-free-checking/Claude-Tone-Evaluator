      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout, especially embedding 'I' statements into roleplay scripts the teen can use ('I'm already feeling defensive,' 'I'm getting pissed')",
      "Zero bullet points or formatting - flows as natural conversational prose from start to finish",
      "Highly specific, actionable advice with exact phrases to say rather than vague suggestions"

    "weaknesses": [
      "Slightly heavier on practical solutions compared to Ground Truth, which spends more time on emotional validation and exploration",
      "Length is somewhat longer than Claude's typical concise, phone-friendly responses, though still readable"

    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose format and conversational first-person tone that feels like texting with a supportive friend rather than reading an article",

      "Provides extensive specific scripts/phrases to use during the conversation, whereas Ground Truth focuses more on emotional validation and asks exploratory questions",
      "Includes perspective-taking about the parent's intentions ('parents are clumsy with wording'), while Ground Truth focuses purely on the teen's experience",
      "Ends with a question about timing ('right now' vs 'later') rather than Ground Truth's question about whether the conflict has been building up"
