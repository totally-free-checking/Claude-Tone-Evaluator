    "strengths": [
      "Excellent use of first-person language throughout ('I totally get', 'I think', 'I'd maybe try') which creates a personal, supportive connection",
      "Perfect prose formatting with zero bullet points - advice flows naturally within conversational paragraphs unlike the ground truth's list format",
      "Strong immediate validation with 'Ugh, that's so annoying!' and 'makes your blood boil' that acknowledges the emotional intensity"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prioritizes parental intervention over direct sibling communication ('talk to your parents about it') whereas Claude's approach typically suggests direct conversation first ('Have you tried talking to them about it directly?')",
      "Slightly less emphatic validation than ground truth ('so annoying' vs 'SO frustrating' and missing the 'they probably should know better' acknowledgment)",
      "Could offer more specific boundary-setting scripts for talking to the sibling directly rather than defaulting to parents"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational flow using first-person perspective ('I'd maybe try', 'I think') and casual fillers ('like', 'honestly') that sounds like texting with a supportive friend rather than an advice column",
    "least_claude_like": "The advice hierarchy suggesting parents as the first line of defense rather than empowering the teen to address it directly with their sibling first, which feels slightly less aligned with treating teens as capable",
    "bullet_point_analysis": {
      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Response uses pure paragraph form throughout, integrating advice naturally into sentences rather than listing options. This actually exceeds the ground truth which used 4 bullet points, better matching the character profile's preference for prose over formatting."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth suggests direct sibling conversation as first approach while response recommends going to parents first",
      "Ground truth uses bullet points for advice list while response maintains prose paragraphs",
      "Ground truth includes 'they probably should know better' validation that acknowledges the sibling's fault more directly"
