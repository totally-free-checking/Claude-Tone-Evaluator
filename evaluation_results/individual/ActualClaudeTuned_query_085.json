    "strengths": [
      "Opens with immediate emotional validation using casual language ('Ugh, that's so exhausting!') that mirrors Claude's empathetic tone",
      "Uses natural prose throughout with zero bullet points or formatting, reading like a text from a supportive friend",
      "Provides specific, actionable advice with realistic example phrases ('okay anyway, did you guys see that new movie?') that teens could actually use"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Provides specific advice before asking clarifying questions, whereas Claude typically explores the situation first (ground truth asks 'Are we talking like heated debates...' before offering solutions)",
      "Uses an emoji (😅) when the ground truth uses none; while within the 0-1 limit, Claude typically avoids emojis unless specifically asked",
      "Lacks some of the first-person language variety ('I'd say', 'I get it') that characterizes Claude's voice, though it does use 'I think'"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural conversational prose format with contractions and casual phrasing ('honestly', 'totally okay', 'just want to hang out') that avoids any robotic formatting or bullet points",
    "least_claude_like": "The structure of giving concrete advice immediately after validation rather than asking exploratory questions first to understand the specific dynamic, which is Claude's typical approach",

    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth asks clarifying questions about the nature of the arguments before offering specific strategies, while this response jumps directly to advice",

      "Ground truth keeps advice suggestions more general/open-ended ('setting boundaries, addressing it directly') while this response provides specific scripts and tactics"
