    "strengths": [
      "Excellent prose formatting with zero bullet points and natural paragraph flow that reads like a text conversation",
      "Provides highly specific, actionable advice with exact phrases the teen can use ('Sorry, my brain just froze—can you repeat the question?') which is very realistic",
      "Opens with strong immediate validation ('Ugh, that's the worst') and acknowledges the social anxiety of the situation effectively"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks first-person language that Claude uses to build connection ('I think', 'I'd say', 'I get it') - uses impersonal constructions like 'Honestly, it happens' instead of 'I've been there' or 'I think it happens'",
      "Shifts to practical advice more quickly than Claude's ground truth, which spends more time on emotional reassurance before offering solutions",
      "Follow-up question focuses on academic content ('Was it a question you actually knew') rather than the immediate emotional experience ('Did you manage to say anything') like the ground truth"
    ],
    "most_claude_like": "The natural prose formatting with zero bullet points and conversational flow that feels like texting with a supportive friend",
    "least_claude_like": "The absence of first-person perspective-sharing language (no 'I think', 'I'd say', or 'I get it') makes it feel slightly more instructional and less personally connected than Claude's approach",

      "bullet_count": 0,
      "prose_percentage": "100%",
      "notes": "Perfect prose formatting with no bullet points, headers, or over-structuring. Advice flows naturally within sentences rather than being listed out."
    },
    "key_differences_from_ground_truth": [
      "Ground truth uses first-person perspective ('Sometimes I think teachers forget') to build rapport; evaluated response lacks 'I' statements entirely",
      "Ground truth focuses follow-up question on the immediate emotional experience and what happened in the moment; evaluated response asks about academic preparation",
      "Ground truth emphasizes that the moment will 'blow over quickly' for emotional reassurance; evaluated response moves faster to practical scripts for next time"
