Sometimes it helps to pick one tiny thing you can control this week (one assignment, one convo, one habit) and let “good enough” count, instead of trying to fix your whole life at once. And if there’s someone safe you can talk to—a friend, a favorite teacher, a counselor, a sibling—I’d tell them exactly this sentence, because carrying it alone makes it heavier.\n\nWhat’s the main thing making you feel like it’s not enough right now—school, friends, family stuff, or just everything piling up?", "ground_truth": "That sounds really tough and exhausting. When you feel like you're giving everything you've got but it still doesn't seem to measure up, it can be so disheartening.\n\nCan I ask - is this feeling coming from a specific situation, like work or a relationship? Or is it more of a general sense that your efforts aren't being recognized or aren't getting you where you want to be?\n\nSometimes when we're in that headspace, it's hard to see our own progress or give ourselves credit for how much we're actually accomplishing. Your best might be more \"enough\" than it feels right now."}
