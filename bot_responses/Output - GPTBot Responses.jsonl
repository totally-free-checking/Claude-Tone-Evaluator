You can ask:\n- “What are you trying to find when you go through my stuff?”\nNot to excuse it—just so you can shut down the motive.\n\n## 6) If you’re about to lose it in the moment\nDo a “pause script” so you don’t go nuclear:\n- “I’m too mad to talk right now.

Sometimes our brains freeze because \"do assignment\" feels like climbing Mount Everest.\n\n**Set a timer for 10-15 minutes** and tell yourself you only have to work for that long.

Even if the comparison seems \"positive,\" it still feels crappy because it's not really seeing *you*.\n\nWant to vent about what happened? Sometimes it helps just to get it out.

Most people understand the need for space if you explain it nicely. And remember - wanting alone time doesn't make you a bad friend!\n\nHow clingy are we talking?

You can offer alternatives:\n- invite them to do stuff with you (and kinder people) where they don’t have to perform\n- remind them it’s okay to step back from a group that makes them act out of character\n\n### 4) Set a boundary if it’s bleeding onto you\nYou can be supportive *and* not tolerate cruelty:\n- “I want to hang out, but I’m not down for trashing people.”\n- “If we’re going to talk about someone, can we keep it respectful? Otherwise I’m going to change the subject / head out.”\n\n### 5) Watch for bigger red flags\nIf the group is pushing harassment, bullying, bigoted “jokes,” pressure to do risky stuff, or isolating your friend from others, that’s more serious. In that case it can help to loop in a trusted adult/mentor (especially if someone’s being targeted or unsafe).\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- How old are you both (roughly)?\n- What’s the mean behavior you’re seeing (toward you, others, or both)?\n- Has your friend changed with you specifically, or mainly when they’re around that group?\n\nI can help you craft exactly what to say based on the situation.","ground_truth":"That's such a tough situation to watch. It can be really hard when you see someone you care about changing in ways that don't feel like them, especially when it seems tied to new people in their life.\n\nA few thoughts that might help:\n\n**Give it some time first** - Sometimes people go through phases when they're figuring out where they fit in with new groups. Your friend might come back to themselves once the \"new friend\" excitement settles.\n\n**Stay connected without being preachy** - Keep being the good friend you've always been. Invite them to hang out one-on-one when possible. Being judgmental about their new friends might push them away, even if you're right.\n\n**Trust your friend's judgment (mostly)** - They might be seeing sides of these people that you're not, or working through their own stuff.\n\n**But also trust your gut** - If you're genuinely worried about your friend being treated badly or pressured into things that could hurt them, it's okay to have one honest conversation about what you're noticing.\n\nHow long has this been going on?

First off, don't be so hard on yourself - having feelings for multiple people is way more common than you might think. It doesn't make you a bad person at all.\n\nThe guilt you're feeling probably comes from thinking you \"should\" only like one person at a time, but emotions don't always follow neat rules like that. Hearts can be pretty messy sometimes!\n\nA few things that might help:\n- Are you actually dating either of these people, or are these more like crushes?\n- What specifically is making you feel most guilty about it?\n- Sometimes these feelings sort themselves out naturally over time\n\nThe main thing is being honest with yourself about what you're feeling and, if you are in any kind of relationship, being fair to the other person/people involved. But the feelings themselves? Totally normal, and nothing to beat yourself up over.\n\nWant to talk through what's going on a bit more? Sometimes it helps just to get it all out."}
