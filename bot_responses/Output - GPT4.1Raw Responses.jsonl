{"query": "I just walked into class and realized I’m wearing two different shoes.", "response": "Oh no! That’s a classic mix-up. On the bright side, you’re adding some unexpected fashion flair to your day! If anyone notices, you can call it “performance art” or say you’re starting a new trend. Do your shoes at least kind of match, or is this a totally wild combo?"}
{"query": "My teacher asked for my homework and I fully forgot it existed.", "response": "Oh no, that happens to everyone sometimes! If you want, I can help you figure out what to do next. Maybe you could try explaining to your teacher honestly, or see if you can do the homework quickly now and turn it in late. If you tell me what the homework is about, I can help you get started!"}
{"query": "I got seated next to someone I used to be friends with and it’s so awkward.", "response": "Oh, that sounds rough! It’s such a weird feeling—like you’re not quite sure how to act. Are you trying to avoid conversation, or just hoping it’s not too uncomfortable? If you want tips on handling the situation or just want to vent, I’m here for you!"}
{"query": "My best friend is being super dry over text and won’t tell me why.", "response": "Ugh, that’s the worst! It’s so hard not to overthink when someone acts weird over text, especially if it’s your best friend. Sometimes people are just going through stuff or distracted, but it *would* be nice if they just said so!\n\nHave you tried asking if everything’s okay? Sometimes a simple “Hey, I feel like something’s up—are you alright?” can open up the convo. Or you could say you miss your usual chats and see if they respond. If they still don’t share, maybe give them a bit of space and check in later—it’s probably not about you, but it’s understandable to feel concerned.\n\nDo you want to talk more about what happened, or maybe come up with what to text next?"}
{"query": "Someone started a rumor about me and I don’t know how to shut it down.", "response": "I'm really sorry that’s happening—you don’t deserve that stress. Rumors can feel overwhelming, but you *do* have options. Here are a few tips:\n\n1. **Stay Calm**  \nTry not to react emotionally or confront the rumor-spreaders aggressively. Staying cool shows maturity and helps keep things from escalating.\n\n2. **Address It Directly (if you feel comfortable)**  \nIf you know who started it or who’s spreading it, you might consider talking to them calmly and privately. Sometimes clearing things up directly is all it takes.\n\n3. **Clarify with People You Trust**  \nLet your close friends or trusted colleagues know the truth. Having a support network helps and they might help counter the rumor if they hear it.\n\n4. **Avoid Feeding the Rumor**  \nSometimes ignoring the rumor is the quickest way to get it to die out, especially if it’s silly or baseless.\n\n5. **Consider a Statement (if it’s serious)**  \nIf the rumor is damaging your reputation, you can clarify the truth in a brief, confident way—either in person, in a group setting, or online if that’s appropriate.\n\n6. **Documentation**  \nIf the rumor is getting into harassment territory, document incidents or messages. This could help if you need to take things further (like talking to HR, school officials, etc.).\n\nWant to talk about what the rumor is or just need to vent? I’m here for you."}
{"query": "I think I bombed my math test and I’m trying not to panic.", "response": "Oh man, I’m sorry you’re feeling that way—that’s such a tough spot to be in. Tests can really mess with your head, especially right after taking them. Remember, a single test doesn’t define your abilities or your worth. Even if it didn’t go great, it’s not the end of the world, and there’s always a chance things turned out better than you think.\n\nIf you want to vent about what happened or talk through the questions that tripped you up, I’m here to listen. And if you want some tips on dealing with the anxiety or on bouncing back, I’ve got you!"}
{"query": "My group project partner hasn’t done anything and it’s due tomorrow.", "response": "That’s so frustrating! Group projects are supposed to be a team effort, but it sounds like the work has all landed on your shoulders. Do you want some advice on how to handle it, or just need to vent?\n\nIf you still have time, maybe try reaching out to your partner—sometimes a direct, kind message can motivate them to help or at least explain what’s going on. If not, and you have to finish it solo, you might want to let your teacher know what happened, either before handing it in or in a note with your submission. Teachers usually understand, and it can help prevent you from being penalized for someone else’s lack of effort.\n\nIf you want help getting through the project quickly, feel free to tell me what it’s about! I’ll do what I can to help you finish it."}
{"query": "I just got invited to a party and I don’t know how to ask my parents.", "response": "That’s totally understandable—it can feel a bit nerve-wracking! Here are a few tips to help you ask your parents:\n\n1. **Pick the right time:** Try asking when they seem relaxed and in a good mood.\n2. **Share the details:** Let them know who invited you, where the party is, who’s going, and what time it’ll be.\n3. **Show responsibility:** Talk about how you plan to be safe, and offer to check in or share your location.\n4. **Be honest:** If you’re nervous, it’s okay to tell them you’re excited but unsure how to ask.\n\nHere’s an example:\n“Hey, I got invited to a party by [friend’s name] this weekend. It’s at [location], and a bunch of friends will be there. I’d really like to go, and I promise to check in and be responsible. Is it okay if I go?”\n\nIf you want, I can help you come up with a message that fits your style!"}
{"query": "My parents checked my phone and now they’re acting weird.", "response": "That sounds really stressful! Parents checking your phone can feel like a huge invasion of privacy. Their behavior might mean they found something they didn't expect or don't understand. If you're comfortable, would you like to talk more about what happened? Sometimes just having someone to listen can help you figure out what to do next."}
{"query": "I accidentally called my teacher ‘mom’ and I want to disappear.", "response": "Oh gosh, that’s such a classic! Honestly, it happens to almost everyone at some point. Teachers spend so much time with us, and sometimes our brains just mix things up. I know it feels embarrassing right now, but your teacher has probably heard it before and might’ve even found it a little sweet or funny. You’ll laugh about it soon, promise! Want some tips to get over the awkwardness?"}
{"query": "My friend keeps copying everything I do and it’s getting annoying.", "response": "That sounds really frustrating! It can feel weird when someone seems to mimic your actions all the time. Sometimes people do this because they admire you or feel unsure about themselves, but that doesn't make it less annoying.\n\nHave you talked to your friend about how you feel? Sometimes just mentioning it can help—like, \"Hey, I’ve noticed you copy me a lot, and honestly, it’s starting to bother me.\" If you’re not comfortable being direct, you could try switching things up or gently encouraging your friend to do their own thing.\n\nDo you want advice on how to approach the conversation, or would you rather vent more about it?"}
{"query": "I saw my crush talking to someone else and now I feel dumb.", "response": "Hey, don’t be too hard on yourself—those feelings are completely normal! It’s totally natural to feel a little awkward or insecure when you see someone you like talking to someone else. It doesn’t mean you’re dumb or anything is wrong with you. Crushes can stir up all kinds of emotions, sometimes out of nowhere.\n\nRemember, your crush talking to someone else doesn’t take away from your worth or mean you don’t have a chance. Try to focus on what makes you awesome (because you definitely are!), and maybe think about ways you could chat with your crush when you feel ready. If you want to talk more about it or need advice on what to do next, I’m here for you!"}
{"query": "I have to present today and my hands won’t stop shaking.", "response": "It’s totally normal to feel nervous before a presentation! Lots of people experience shaky hands—it just means your body has extra adrenaline right now. Here are a few quick tips that might help:\n\n1. **Deep Breaths:** Try a few slow, deep breaths. Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, and exhale for 4. This can help steady your nerves.\n2. **Physical Reset:** If you can, gently shake out your arms or flick your wrists to release some tension.\n3. **Ground Yourself:** Place your feet firmly on the floor and feel the ground beneath you. This can help anchor you.\n4. **Small Sips:** Drink a little water, but not too much.\n5. **Focus on the Message:** Remember, it’s not about you, but about what you have to say.\n\nAnd if your hands keep shaking, you can keep them occupied with your notes, a clicker, or even just holding them together in front of you. You’ve got this! If you want to practice an intro or need a pep talk, I’m here."}
{"query": "My friend told me a secret and I’m not sure I’m supposed to know.", "response": "That sounds a little tricky! It can feel awkward when you’re not sure if you were meant to hear something. If you’re worried or confused, it might help to ask your friend gently if it’s okay that you know. Letting them know you value their trust and want to keep their secret can go a long way. If you’re not comfortable bringing it up, just staying quiet and respecting their privacy is always a safe choice. Want to talk more about what happened?"}
{"query": "My sibling keeps going through my stuff and I’m about to lose it.", "response": "Ugh, that sounds really frustrating! Siblings can sometimes push our boundaries without realizing how much it bothers us. Do you want some advice on how to handle it, or just need to vent? If you want to try and solve it, I could help you think of ways to talk to your sibling or maybe set up some boundaries."}
{"query": "I forgot I had practice after school and I planned something else.", "response": "That happens to the best of us! Balancing schedules can get tricky sometimes. Is there any way you can adjust your plans, or will you need to reschedule one of them?"}
{"query": "I got a weird vibe from a friend’s boyfriend and I don’t know what to do.", "response": "That sounds uncomfortable. Trusting your instincts is important, and it's okay to feel unsure if something feels off. If you’re comfortable, could you say more about what happened or what gave you that vibe? Sometimes just talking it out helps clarify things.\n\nIn general, here are a few options you might consider:\n\n- **Observe:** Sometimes it helps to watch their interactions over time and see if you still feel uneasy.\n- **Talk to your friend:** If it feels right, you could gently ask your friend how things are going or share your feelings, making sure to avoid judgment.\n- **Protect yourself:** If it’s about your own safety or boundaries, it’s okay to limit contact or be cautious.\n- **Trust yourself:** You know yourself best. If you don’t feel comfortable, it’s valid to take a step back.\n\nNo need to rush decisions; your feelings are valid. If you want to share more details, I’m here to listen and help figure it out with you."}
{"query": "My parents are fighting again and I can hear everything from my room.", "response": "I'm really sorry you're going through this right now. Hearing your parents argue can feel stressful and unsettling. If you can, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that their fight isn't your fault. Is there anything you usually do to help distract yourself or feel better during times like this? If you want to talk more about it or just chat about something else, I'm here."}
{"query": "My teacher thinks I cheated because my answers match someone’s.", "response": "I'm sorry you're in this situation—it sounds stressful! Sometimes answers match for legitimate reasons, especially if the questions are straightforward or the class studied together. If you didn’t cheat, the best thing you can do is to calmly explain your side to your teacher. \n\nYou might say something like, “I understand why matching answers could look suspicious, but I honestly did my own work. If you want, I can explain how I reached my answers or show my process.” \n\nBeing open and respectful shows maturity. If you studied with classmates or did the homework together, mention that too. Teachers usually appreciate honesty. \n\nIs there anything specific you want help with, like what to say, or how to write an email to your teacher?"}
{"query": "I got left on read by my crush and it’s making me spiral.", "response": "I’m really sorry you’re feeling like this—it totally sucks to be left on read, especially by someone you care about. It’s super easy to overthink, but remember: getting left on read doesn’t always mean something bad! People get busy, distracted, or sometimes just don’t know how to respond.\n\nTry not to let your mind run wild with worst-case scenarios (I know—it’s way easier said than done). If you can, do something nice for yourself today: go for a walk, watch a favorite show, or talk to a friend. And when you’re ready, maybe reach out again later, casually. Your worth doesn't hinge on one text message!"}
{"query": "Someone took a picture of me without asking and posted it.", "response": "I'm sorry that happened to you—it can feel really uncomfortable when someone shares your photo without your permission. If you want the photo to be taken down, you could kindly reach out to the person and ask them to remove it. You have the right to privacy, and most people will understand if you express your feelings about it.\n\nIf the photo is on a social media platform, you can also check if there’s an option to report the post or request its removal. Each platform usually has guidelines about privacy and unauthorized photos.\n\nLet me know if you want help wording a message or if you need info on how to report a photo—I’m here for you."}
{"query": "My friend keeps making ‘jokes’ that feel like insults.", "response": "I'm sorry to hear that—it can be tough when someone’s humor crosses into territory that feels hurtful. It's not uncommon for people to hide criticism or frustration behind jokes, but that doesn't make it okay.\n\nHave you talked to your friend about how these jokes are making you feel? Sometimes, people aren't aware that their words are having a negative impact. You could say something like, \"Hey, I know you’re joking, but sometimes it feels like these jokes are actually digs at me. Can we keep it lighthearted?\" If you don’t feel comfortable bringing it up directly, maybe you could try gently changing the subject or not laughing when the jokes come up—that can signal that you’re not enjoying them.\n\nUltimately, your feelings are valid. You deserve to spend time with people who are respectful and make you feel good. If your friend keeps crossing the line even after talking, it might be worth considering how much time and emotional energy you want to invest in that relationship. If you want help figuring out what to say or how to handle this, I can help brainstorm!"}
{"query": "I’m stuck sitting alone at lunch today and it feels obvious.", "response": "I’m sorry you’re feeling that way. It can feel really weird and uncomfortable to eat alone, especially if you’re used to having company. If it helps, lots of people end up sitting solo sometimes (even if it seems like everyone else has someone!). \n\nIf you want to make the time feel less awkward, maybe try listening to music, getting lost in a book or scrolling through something funny on your phone. Or, if you feel up to it, you could try to strike up a conversation with someone nearby—even just a simple “hey, mind if I join you?” can make all the difference.\n\nBut honestly, it’s okay to sit alone! It definitely doesn’t mean anything about you. If you want to chat, I’m here to keep you company. What’s for lunch today?"}
{"query": "I just found out my friends hung out without inviting me.", "response": "I'm sorry—that stings. It's tough to feel left out, especially when it's people you're close to. Want to talk about it? Sometimes just sharing how you're feeling can help, or if you want, we can brainstorm ways to approach your friends about it. Whatever you need, I'm here."}
{"query": "My mom signed me up for something and didn’t ask me first.", "response": "That sounds frustrating! It’s never fun when decisions are made about your life without your input. Do you want to talk about what she signed you up for?"}
{"query": "My dad wants to talk about ‘my attitude’ and I’m already annoyed.", "response": "Ugh, that’s rough! Those conversations can feel super awkward even before they start. Do you know what’s on his mind, or is it just the dreaded “we need to talk” vibe?"}
{"query": "I have like five assignments due and my brain refuses to start.", "response": "Ugh, I totally get it—that “stuck” feeling is super common, especially when everything piles up at once. Let’s break this down together!\n\nFirst, just pick one assignment (maybe the quickest or easiest?) and set a super small goal, like opening the document and writing your name. Once you do that, it’s an official start! Sometimes just getting the wheels moving—even a tiny bit—helps your brain shift gears.\n\nWant to tell me what your assignments are? I can help you organize them or brainstorm a plan. Or, if you want, we can come up with some hacks to get that motivation going!"}
{"query": "I think I might have said something rude and I didn’t mean it.", "response": "It’s totally normal to feel that way sometimes! Everyone slips up or worries about how they came across. If you’re concerned, maybe you could gently check in with the person and let them know you didn’t mean any offense. A simple, sincere apology can go a long way. Do you want to talk about what happened?"}
{"query": "My coach yelled at me in front of everyone and I’m embarrassed.", "response": "I'm really sorry that happened to you. Getting yelled at in front of others can feel awful—it's normal to feel embarrassed and even hurt. Coaches can get intense, but that doesn’t mean it’s okay for them to single you out like that.\n\nIf you want, you can talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling, or even approach your coach later for a calm conversation about it. Remember, everyone makes mistakes, and being yelled at doesn't define you. You're still valuable and respected by your teammates, even if things felt rough for a moment. \n\nIf you want to talk more about what happened or how you’re feeling, I’m here for you!"}
{"query": "My friend keeps asking to copy my homework and I’m tired of it.", "response": "That sounds really frustrating! It’s tough when someone keeps relying on you instead of doing their own work. Maybe you could try gently telling your friend that you want them to learn and do their own homework—it’s important for both of you. You could offer to help them understand the material instead of just giving them your answers. If they keep asking, it’s okay to set boundaries and let them know you don’t feel comfortable sharing your work. Your education is important, and so is your friendship!"}
{"query": "I accidentally liked an old post while stalking someone.", "response": "Oh no, classic accidental like! It happens to the best of us. Honestly, most people have done it at some point. If you unlike it quickly, chances are they won’t even notice, especially if the post is really old. If you’re feeling anxious about it, just remember that social media is full of little mishaps—people rarely read much into them!"}
{"query": "I’m pretty sure someone is mad at me but they won’t say why.", "response": "Ugh, that’s such a frustrating situation! Sometimes when someone is upset but doesn’t say why, it can leave you feeling confused and anxious. Have you tried reaching out and asking directly if something’s wrong? Sometimes just letting them know you’ve noticed and you care can open things up. Or maybe you’re worried it’ll make things awkward? \n\nIf you want, you could tell me more about what happened—I’m here to help you think it through!"}
{"query": "My teacher moved my seat away from my friends and I’m mad.", "response": "That’s really frustrating! It’s hard when your seat gets changed, especially if it means you can’t sit with your friends anymore. Do you know why your teacher moved you? Sometimes teachers just want everyone to focus, but it can still feel unfair. Want to talk about it more?"}
{"query": "I got told to ‘calm down’ and now I’m even less calm.", "response": "Ugh, that’s the worst! Being told to “calm down” when you’re upset usually has the opposite effect. It’s like someone handing you a cup labeled “chill vibes” and it’s actually filled with spicy salsa. If you want to vent or talk about what happened, I’m here for you. Or if you just want some calming tips, let me know!"}
{"query": "I didn’t get picked for the team and I’m trying to act fine.", "response": "I'm really sorry to hear that. It’s tough not getting picked, and it’s completely normal to feel upset or disappointed. Even if you’re acting fine, it doesn’t mean those feelings aren’t real or valid. If you want to talk about it or share more, I’m here for you. And just remember: not getting picked this time doesn’t define your value or what you bring. There are always other chances and places where your talents shine."}
{"query": "My friend is dating someone I really don’t trust.", "response": "That sounds tough. It can be really uncomfortable when someone you care about is with someone you’re not sure about. Do you know why you don’t trust this person—have they done something specific, or is it more just a gut feeling? If you want to talk it out, I’m here for you."}
{"query": "I overheard people talking about me in the hallway.", "response": "That sounds like it might have been uncomfortable or unsettling. If you feel like sharing, what did you overhear? Or are you more wondering how to handle the situation? I’m here to listen, so whatever you need."}
{"query": "I have to choose classes for next year and I feel so behind.", "response": "It’s totally normal to feel a bit overwhelmed when picking classes! Lots of people feel that way, and you’re not alone. If you want, I can help you think through your options or chat about what feels overwhelming. Are there specific classes you’re worried about, or is it more about the overall process?"}
{"query": "My parents want my grades to be perfect and it’s stressing me out.", "response": "I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. That kind of pressure is tough. Wanting to please your parents is totally understandable, but it doesn’t mean you have to be perfect. No one is! If you feel comfortable, it might help to talk to your parents about how their expectations are making you feel. Maybe you could let them know that you’re trying your best, and grades aren’t the only thing that matter.\n\nIf you ever want to talk more about it or need help with study tips, balancing stress, or just venting, I’m here for you! Do you have a specific subject that’s worrying you most?"}
{"query": "Someone keeps texting me nonstop and I don’t know how to set a boundary.", "response": "That’s a tough situation! Setting boundaries can feel awkward, but you deserve your space. Here’s a way to approach it:\n\n**1. Be honest and direct:**  \nYou could say something like,  \n*\"Hey, I appreciate your messages, but I need some time to myself sometimes. I might not respond right away, but I’m not ignoring you.\"*\n\n**2. Set your expectation:**  \nLet them know how often you’re comfortable texting. For example,  \n*\"I usually check my phone a couple of times a day, so I might not reply immediately.\"*\n\n**3. Stick to your boundaries:**  \nIf they keep texting, don’t feel pressured to respond instantly. Give yourself permission to reply when *you* want.\n\nIf you’re worried about hurting their feelings, you can frame it as needing time for yourself, rather than about them. If the texts become overwhelming or disrespectful, you have every right to mute notifications or block them if needed.\n\nWant help composing a message to send?"}
{"query": "I forgot my lunch and I’m trying not to be dramatic about it.", "response": "Oh no! That’s never fun. Want help brainstorming a backup plan? Or do you just need someone to say, “That seriously stinks!” Either way, I’ve got you."}
{"query": "My friend borrowed my stuff and returned it ruined.", "response": "Oh no, that's really frustrating! It can feel disappointing when someone doesn’t take care of your things, especially a friend. Have you talked to them about it yet? If you haven't, it might help to let them know how you feel and see if they’re willing to make it right somehow. If you want, I can help you figure out how to approach the conversation."}
{"query": "I think my friend is lying to me and I don’t know how to ask.", "response": "That sounds stressful—trust is a big deal in friendships. If you’re worried your friend is lying, it’s understandable to feel unsure about how to approach them.\n\nHere’s a gentle way you might bring it up:\n\n1. **Pick the right moment:** Find a private, calm time to talk.\n2. **Share your feelings, not accusations:** Use \"I\" statements to avoid sounding confrontational. For example:  \n   \"I've been feeling confused about something you said, and I just want to understand better.\"\n3. **Ask for clarity:** Instead of saying \"I think you're lying,\" try:  \n   \"Can you help me understand this? It doesn't quite add up for me.\"\n4. **Listen to their side:** Give them space to explain. Sometimes, there are misunderstandings instead of intentional lies.\n\nIf you want, I can help you come up with specific words or phrases to use. Remember, your feelings matter, and honest conversations are part of strong friendships."}
{"query": "My teacher called on me and my mind went completely blank.", "response": "Oh, I totally get that—it happens to everyone sometimes! When you're put on the spot, your mind can just freeze up. It's nothing to be embarrassed about, and even teachers understand that nerves can kick in. If it happens again, you could try taking a deep breath and asking for a moment to think. Or you can say, “I’m not sure right now, but can I come back to this later?” With practice, it gets easier! Want to talk about what the question was, or what class it happened in?"}
{"query": "I got in trouble for something I didn’t do.", "response": "I’m really sorry to hear that! It’s frustrating and unfair when you get blamed for something you didn’t do. If you want to talk about what happened, I’m here to listen. Sometimes it can help to figure out the best way to clear things up or just to get it off your chest. Would you like to share more about the situation?"}
{"query": "I feel like my friends only talk to me when they need something.", "response": "I'm really sorry you're feeling that way—it can be tough when it feels like friendships are one-sided. If you want, we can talk more about what's been happening. Sometimes, just sharing a bit helps you sort through your thoughts. Do you want advice on how to handle it or just someone to listen?"}
{"query": "My parents won’t let me go out and everyone else can.", "response": "That sounds frustrating! It’s hard to see your friends having more freedom while you feel stuck. Have you tried talking to your parents about it and sharing how you feel? Sometimes explaining why it’s important to you, or suggesting you could check in regularly, helps them feel more comfortable. If you’d like, I can help you figure out what to say or come up with some ideas to start a conversation!"}
{"query": "I’m getting compared to my sibling again and it sucks.", "response": "That really sucks—I’m sorry you’re going through that. Being compared to a sibling can feel so unfair. Even if people mean well, it can make you feel like you're not being seen for who *you* are.\n\nIf you want to vent more about it, I'm here. And just a reminder: no two siblings are the same, and you have your own strengths and qualities that are totally yours. If you need advice or just someone to listen, I’ve got your back."}
{"query": "My crush smiled at me and now I’m overthinking everything.", "response": "Aw, that’s so sweet! It’s totally normal to overthink after moments like that—especially when it comes to crushes. Their smile probably meant nothing more than they were genuinely happy to see you, or maybe they’re just friendly. But hey, who knows? Sometimes a smile can be a little bit flirty, too!\n\nTry not to stress too much about it. Just enjoy the good feeling, and maybe let yourself smile back next time! Want to tell me more about what happened?"}
{"query": "I got paired with someone in class who literally hates me.", "response": "I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way—it’s tough when you have to work with someone who doesn’t seem to like you. If you want to talk about what happened, I’m here to listen! Sometimes people’s feelings can change with time, or just working together might help you both find some common ground.\n\nAre you okay? Want any advice for working with them?"}
{"query": "I’m pretty sure I’m the ‘backup friend’ and it hurts.", "response": "I’m really sorry you’re feeling that way. Being the “backup friend” can seriously sting—it makes you feel unimportant, like you’re only called when there’s no one else around. That’s tough and it’s valid to feel hurt about it.\n\nYou deserve friends who value you, include you, and genuinely want to spend time with you—not just when it’s convenient. It’s okay to set boundaries or distance yourself from people who make you feel like you’re not a priority. You might want to talk to them about how you’re feeling, or consider spending more time with people who uplift you.\n\nIf you want, I can help brainstorm ways to build stronger friendships, or draft what to say if you decide to share your feelings with them. Whatever you choose, it’s good to remember you’re not alone, and you *do* deserve real, meaningful connections."}
{"query": "I want to quit an activity but I feel guilty.", "response": "It's completely normal to feel guilty about quitting something, especially if you've put time, energy, or heart into it. Sometimes that guilt comes from worrying about letting others down or feeling like you \"should\" stick with it. But your feelings and well-being matter, too!\n\nIf you’re considering quitting, try asking yourself why you want to leave. Are you burnt out? Does it no longer make you happy? Is it keeping you from other important things? Letting yourself reflect might help you understand if quitting is truly the right choice for you.\n\nRemember, quitting doesn’t mean you’ve failed. It’s just a shift—a way to free up your energy for things that matter more to you right now. What activity are you thinking about quitting, if you feel comfortable sharing? Maybe talking it out can help sort through those guilty feelings."}
{"query": "My friend keeps cancelling plans last minute.", "response": "That’s really frustrating! It can feel hurtful or disappointing, especially when you’re looking forward to spending time together. Have you talked to your friend about it? Sometimes people don’t realize how their actions affect others. You could let them know how it makes you feel—just a casual, honest conversation. Or, if you get the sense your friend is going through something, maybe ask if they’re okay. If it keeps happening, it’s totally understandable to protect your own time and energy, too. Would you like some advice on what to say?"}
{"query": "Someone keeps making comments about my body and I hate it.", "response": "I’m really sorry you’re dealing with that. It can feel uncomfortable and disrespectful when someone makes unwanted comments, especially about something personal like your body. You absolutely deserve to be treated with respect.\n\nIf you feel safe and comfortable, you might try telling the person directly that their comments make you uncomfortable and ask them to stop.

{"query": "My friend is pressuring me to do something I’m not comfortable with.", "response": "I'm really sorry you're feeling this way.

If you’d like, I can help you figure out how to say no, or offer tips for talking to your friend about how you’re feeling. Would you like that?"}
{"query": "I walked into the wrong classroom and everyone stared.", "response": "Oh no, that can feel so awkward! But honestly, it happens to almost everyone at some point. Most people probably just thought, “Oh, that person must be in the wrong room,” and then went right back to what they were doing. If it helps, you probably gave them a funny story to tell later!

Parents often start thinking about college early because there’s a lot to consider—applications, grades, activities, and even costs.

If it helps, most of your classmates are probably feeling just as nervous or embarrassed as you!\n\nIf you’re dreading it because you’re worried about messing up, just remember: everyone is learning, and messing up is part of the process. If it’s the “partner” part that’s making it weird, maybe try to focus on the silliness of the situation.

A lot of people worry that they don’t have a “thing,” especially when it seems like everyone else has some sort of passion, talent, or identity they’re proud of.\n\nBut having a “thing” isn’t as straightforward as it looks. Sometimes what people call their “thing” took years to discover, or even happened by accident. And even if you don’t feel like you have a unique hobby or passion at the moment, that doesn’t mean you’re behind or missing out. Sometimes your “thing” is just being a great friend, making people laugh, or even quietly enjoying stuff you already do—but maybe you just don’t label it that way.\n\nIt can help to try new activities or revisit old interests, but there’s no deadline. Your “thing” could be something you stumble onto tomorrow, next year, or even something you create yourself.

{"query": "I’m nervous to eat in front of people at school.", "response": "That’s totally understandable—so many people feel that way! Eating in front of others can make you feel self-conscious, especially at school where there might be a lot going on. If you want, I can share a few tips that might help:\n\n- **Start small:** Try eating with one or two friends you trust before joining bigger groups.\n- **Remember, everyone’s busy:** Most people are focused on their own food and conversations, not on what you’re doing.\n- **Choose foods you’re comfortable with:** If you’re worried about messy foods, stick to things that are easy to eat.\n- **Practice positive self-talk:** Remind yourself that eating is normal and everyone does it!

{"query": "My parents keep asking who I’m texting.", "response": "That sounds a little stressful or maybe annoying! Parents can be pretty curious sometimes. Are you feeling bothered by it?

{"query": "I messed up in front of everyone and I can’t stop replaying it.", "response": "I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. Messing up in front of others can feel *so* overwhelming, but it happens to everyone—even the people who seem the most confident. Our brains love to replay embarrassing moments way more than anyone else ever remembers them!\n\nIf it helps, try to imagine how you’d treat a friend if they were feeling embarrassed—probably with kindness and reassurance, right?
