{"query": "I just walked into class and realized I’m wearing two different shoes.", "response": "Oh no! That’s definitely a mood. But hey, just own it—call it \"fashion-forward\" or \"statement footwear.\" You could even make up a whole story about how it's intentional and represents balance or creativity. Or, if that’s not your vibe, maybe laugh it off with your classmates—chances are you’ll get some good chuckles and make a few people’s day! What kind of shoes are they? Are they even close to matching or hilariously different?"}
{"query": "My teacher asked for my homework and I fully forgot it existed.", "response": "Oh no, I feel you—that's the worst! Don't panic, though. Just be honest with your teacher about forgetting. Teachers are human too, and most understand that things happen. Offer to get it done ASAP or ask if you can make it up in some way. \n\nAlso, maybe set a reminder or jot down deadlines going forward so this doesn’t happen again. You’ve got this!"}
{"query": "I got seated next to someone I used to be friends with and it’s so awkward.", "response": "Oh no, I totally get how that could feel super awkward. It’s such a weird, complicated situation when you’re near someone with history but things aren’t the same anymore. Are they giving off awkward vibes too, or is it mostly in your head? \n\nIf you’re okay with it, you could try keeping things light—like some casual small talk—or just focusing on the event or situation you’re both part of. But if you’re not feeling the energy, it’s totally okay to just keep to yourself and focus on your own comfort. No pressure to force anything!\n\nWould you need help navigating the interaction or just venting about it?"}
{"query": "My best friend is being super dry over text and won’t tell me why.", "response": "Oh no, that can feel so frustrating! Sometimes people act differently over text if they're distracted, stressed, or just not feeling their best—it might not even have to do with you. Maybe try reaching out in a gentle, thoughtful way. Something like, *\"Hey, are you okay? You seem a little quieter than usual, and I just wanted to check in to see if everything’s alright.”* That gives them space to open up without pressure and shows you genuinely care.\n\nIf they still don’t share much, give them a little time and don’t take it personally—it might be something they need to work through themselves. If they’re your best friend, they’ll likely come around when they feel ready! 💛"}
{"query": "Someone started a rumor about me and I don’t know how to shut it down.", "response": "Ah jeez, rumors can be so frustrating and hurtful. I'm sorry you're dealing with that. The good news is, you *can* handle this in a way that protects your peace and reputation. Here’s some advice that might help you shut it down:\n\n1. **Stay Calm**: Take a deep breath and try not to let anger or panic take over. Reacting impulsively can sometimes fuel the fire, even if you don’t mean to.\n\n2. **Address It Directly (If Necessary)**: If you know who started the rumor, you might want to approach them calmly and ask why they’re spreading false information. Sometimes bringing it up privately makes the person realize the harm they’re causing and stops things before it gets worse.\n\n3. **Clear Your Name**: Be upfront and honest with people who seem to believe the rumor. If you're comfortable, address the situation by saying something like, “Hey, I heard this is going around, and it’s absolutely not true.” Keep it simple, straightforward, and drama-free.\n\n4. **Avoid Over-Explaining**: If you make a huge deal out of the rumor, it might give it more attention than it deserves. Address it when needed, but don’t let it consume you.\n\n5. **Lean on Your Support Network**: Let trusted friends, family, or coworkers know what’s going on so they can support you and help counteract misinformation. People who know you well will have your back and can spread the truth about you.\n\n6. **Show Confidence in Yourself**: Rumors often lose power when the person they're about shrugs them off like it's no big deal. Focus on being your awesome self—it’s harder for lies to stick when your actions prove otherwise.\n\n7. **Consider Blocking Out Negativity**: If the rumor’s mostly online, you might want to block or mute people fueling it. Engage only with the positive corners of your social circle.\n\n8. **Know When to Let It Go**: Most rumors die down on their own over time—especially if you don’t give them attention. People move on faster than we think sometimes.\n\nIt’s totally normal to feel upset or stressed about this, but you’re stronger than it. If you rise above it, people will see your integrity shine through. You got this!"}
{"query": "I think I bombed my math test and I’m trying not to panic.", "response": "Oh no, I’m sorry you're feeling this way! First off, take a deep breath—it's going to be okay. I know how overwhelming it can feel when a test doesn’t go as planned, but remember one test doesn’t define your abilities or your worth. \n\nIf it helps, think back and see if there were parts of the test that went well. Sometimes we focus on the negatives and overlook what we actually did right. Either way, you’ll have a chance to learn from this and move forward! If you think you struggled with certain concepts, maybe you can go over those areas with a teacher, friend, or tutoring resource to feel better prepared next time.\n\nFor now, give yourself a little grace and maybe do something to relax—listen to music, watch a show, or anything that lets you clear your head. You’ve got this, and it’ll work out!"}
{"query": "My group project partner hasn’t done anything and it’s due tomorrow.", "response": "Ugh, that’s super frustrating—I’m sorry you’re dealing with that! Group projects can be so challenging when one person isn’t pulling their weight. Since the deadline is tomorrow, here are a few productive steps you can take:\n\n### 1. **Reach Out to Them (One Last Time)**\nSend them a message or call to make sure they’re aware of the deadline and ask if they’ve been able to complete their part. Keep it polite but firm, like:\n*\"Hey, just wanted to check in—are you able to finish [specific task(s)] for the project? Since it’s due tomorrow, it’s super important so we don’t miss the deadline.\"*\nSometimes people drop the ball because they’re overwhelmed or distracted, and a direct nudge can help. If not, at least you know you tried!\n\n### 2. **Prioritize What Needs Doing**\nMake a list of what you can handle on your own before the deadline. Maybe you can simplify or adapt the scope of the project to make it manageable. Focus your energy on completing what you can—don’t try to cover for everything if you don’t have time.\n\n### 3. **Document Everything**\nIf the project requires you to submit individual contributions or if your teacher/professor evaluates teamwork, make sure to track who contributed what. You might need to explain the situation later. For example, keep copies of any messages sent to your partner, your work timeline, and any clear proof of having done the majority yourself.\n\n### 4. **Let Your Instructor Know (If Necessary)**\nDepending on the circumstances, it might be worth emailing your instructor or supervisor. Briefly and respectfully explain the situation—they might offer guidance or flexibility, especially if this has been an ongoing issue. Something like:\n*\"I’ve been working on our group project, but my partner hasn’t completed their portion. I’m doing my best to finish what I can before it’s due tomorrow, but I wanted to let you know in case [specific issue].\"*\n\n### 5. **Get It Done (and Take a Breath Later)**\nAt the end of the day, just do your best with what’s in your control. It’s frustrating, but you’re learning how to tackle challenges even when people drop the ball. Once it’s submitted, give yourself some credit for stepping up.\n\nIf this happens regularly with this partner, maybe address the pattern later with them or suggest changes for future group splits. You’ve got this!"}
{"query": "I just got invited to a party and I don’t know how to ask my parents.", "response": "Ooooh, exciting! A party invite! 🎉\n\nThe best way to ask your parents is to approach them calmly and explain the situation clearly. Here's a casual way to go about it:\n\n---\n\n**Start with positivity:**  \n\"Hey [Mom/Dad/Both], I got invited to a party, and I was wondering if I could go!\"\n\n---\n\n**Give details:**  \n\"It’s at [location] on [date and time], and it’s hosted by [person’s name]. A few of my friends are going too, and I thought it’d be fun!\"\n\n---\n\n**Address their concerns before they ask:**  \n\"I can make sure to get [home by X time/you can drop me off or pick me up/I’ll keep in touch while I’m there]. It’s supervised/not a huge party, so it’ll be safe.\"\n\n---\n\n**Offer a compromise, if needed:**  \n\"I totally get it if you’re unsure, but I can stick to whatever rules you want if it makes you feel better.\"\n\n---\n\nParents usually appreciate honesty and a respectful tone. Show them you’ve thought it through and can handle the responsibility! 🤗 How do you feel about asking them?"}
{"query": "My parents checked my phone and now they’re acting weird.", "response": "Oh no, that sounds like a tricky situation. 😬 It’s tough when your parents go through your phone—it can feel like a big invasion of privacy, especially if they found something that surprised or upset them. The way they’re acting weird might mean they’re unsure how to approach whatever they saw. \n\nDo you want to give me a little more context about what they might have seen? Or do you just need advice on how to talk to them about this?"}
{"query": "I accidentally called my teacher ‘mom’ and I want to disappear.", "response": "Oh nooo, the classic “calling your teacher Mom” moment! Honestly, it happens to *so* many people—I promise you're not the first or the last. You were probably just in school mode, and your brain betrayed you for a second. It’s awkward in the moment, sure, but your teacher’s probably used to it and either found it endearing or hilarious. 😅  \n\nJust laugh it off, and trust me, it’ll barely be remembered in a day or two (if that). You could even say something like, “Oops, guess I really respect your authority” next time you see them! It happens to everyone, no need to disappear!"}
{"query": "My friend keeps copying everything I do and it’s getting annoying.", "response": "Oh man, that does sound frustrating! It's nice when friends admire us, but it can definitely feel annoying when it turns into copying everything we do. Have you talked to them about it yet? Sometimes people don’t realize they're doing it unless you gently point it out! You could say something like, “Hey, I’ve noticed you’ve been doing a lot of the same things I do. Is everything okay? What’s going on?” It’ll open up the conversation without being confrontational. \n\nIf it's still bothering you after that, maybe try switching up how you do things—like picking some new hobbies or expressing your style in a different way. It could shake things up and throw them off track a bit! 😊"}
{"query": "I saw my crush talking to someone else and now I feel dumb.", "response": "Aw, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. It can be tough to see someone you like interacting with others, especially if it stirs up a bit of insecurity or self-doubt. But it’s really important to remember that it doesn’t mean they don’t care about you or that you’re not worthy of their attention. People naturally talk to lots of people throughout their day!\n\nTry not to be too hard on yourself. Crushes can stir up all kinds of feelings, but it’s okay to take a deep breath and remind yourself of your awesome qualities. If it’s a situation where you feel jealous or disappointed, that’s normal—just don’t let those feelings convince you that you’re not good enough. You totally are!\n\nIf you’re comfortable, maybe consider talking to your crush more yourself? Building a friendship is a great first step, and who knows where it could go from there. Whatever you decide, remember you’re amazing just the way you are! 💛"}
{"query": "I have to present today and my hands won’t stop shaking.", "response": "Oh no, that sounds stressful! First off, take a deep breath — inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and slowly let it out through your mouth. Repeat that a few times to help calm your nerves.\n\nHere are a few tips to help ground yourself and manage the shaking:\n\n1. **Focus on your breathing:** Slow, controlled breathing can help relax your nervous system. Try the \"4-7-8\" method: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold it for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds.\n\n2. **Hold something steady:** If you’re going to be holding a microphone or pointer during the presentation, grip it gently but firmly. Sometimes just having a firm hold on something helps steady your hands.\n\n3. **Channel nervous energy:** If you can, clench and release your fists a few times before you start. It can help use up some of that adrenaline that’s making you shaky.\n\n4. **Reframe your mindset:** Remind yourself that it's okay to be nervous — it shows you care about doing well! Instead of thinking, *\"What if I mess up?\"* tell yourself, *\"This is a great opportunity to share what I know.\"*\n\n5. **Hydrate and eat something light:** If you’re able to grab a small snack or drink water before you go on, that might help stabilize your body a bit if nerves have messed with your blood sugar.\n\n6. **Practice power poses:** Find a private space and stand tall, chest open, and hands on your hips for a minute or two. This can boost your confidence and make you feel more grounded.\n\nIt’s totally normal to feel like this! Once you start talking, you may find you focus more on the presentation and less on how you’re feeling. You've got this — good luck! 😊"}
{"query": "My friend told me a secret and I’m not sure I’m supposed to know.", "response": "Oh, that's such a tricky situation! Secrets can be delicate, but it sounds like your friend trusted you enough to share it with you. The golden rule here is that if you're unsure whether you're supposed to know, it's best to honor their trust by keeping it to yourself. Don't bring it up or share it with others unless your friend specifically says it's okay.  \n\nIf you're feeling awkward about it, you could gently ask your friend, \"Hey, was that something just between us? I want to make sure I respect your privacy.\" That kind of openness shows you care about their boundaries while reassuring them you're not going to spill the beans."}
{"query": "My sibling keeps going through my stuff and I’m about to lose it.", "response": "Oh no, that sounds really frustrating! It’s tough when people don’t respect boundaries, especially someone close to you like a sibling. Have you been able to talk to them about how it’s making you feel? Sometimes an honest and calm conversation can go a long way. Maybe let them know you’re not angry *at them*, but their actions are upsetting and you need them to stop.  \n\nAlso, if talking hasn’t worked or feels like it might not, it might help to set some boundaries—like locking your door, keeping important things hidden or in a secure spot, or even asking a parent or another family member to step in as a mediator. You deserve to have your space respected! Let me know how you feel about those ideas or if you wanna brainstorm something else."}
{"query": "I forgot I had practice after school and I planned something else.", "response": "Oh no! That happens to the best of us. Balancing everything can be tricky sometimes. Can you reschedule the other thing you planned? Or maybe adjust the timing so everything fits in? Let me know if you want help sorting it out!"}
{"query": "I got a weird vibe from a friend’s boyfriend and I don’t know what to do.", "response": "That sounds like a tricky situation to navigate! It’s definitely worth paying attention to your instincts since people’s energy can give us subtle signals sometimes. Start by reflecting on why the vibe felt off—was it something he said, something about his actions, or maybe just the overall atmosphere? Try to pinpoint what exactly made you uncomfortable because understanding your feelings will help you figure out the next steps.\n\nIf you’re really bothered, you could talk to your friend about it, but tread carefully—this can get into sensitive territory, especially if the relationship is important to her. Instead of jumping in with criticisms, you could focus on your feelings, saying something like, “Hey, I had kind of a strange feeling when I met your boyfriend, but I might be imagining it. How do you feel about him?” This can help start a conversation without feeling like you’re attacking him.\n\nThat said, if you don’t think talking to her is the best move right now, you could just keep an eye on things. Sometimes it’s smart to observe for a while and see if your gut feeling proves true over time. Trust yourself, but give yourself some space to figure it out!"}
{"query": "My parents are fighting again and I can hear everything from my room.", "response": "I'm really sorry you're dealing with that right now. Hearing your parents argue can feel really overwhelming and unsettling. First off, please know it's okay to feel upset, anxious, or even helpless—that's a natural reaction to being around conflict like this.\n\nIf it feels too much to handle, it might help to focus on grounding yourself. Maybe listen to music, watch something comforting, or even practice deep breathing—something to bring a sense of calm to your space. If you have a trusted friend or family member you can talk to, sharing how you're feeling might ease the weight a little.\n\nRemember, their arguments are not your fault, and you don't have to carry their burden. It's okay to focus on taking care of yourself right now. If this happens often, I think talking with someone you trust or even a counselor could be a good step to finding some support. I'm here to listen anytime!"}
{"query": "My teacher thinks I cheated because my answers match someone’s.", "response": "Oh no, that sounds stressful! Did anything happen that might explain why your answers matched? For example, did you work with someone, study from the same material, or maybe use similar resources? If you didn’t cheat, you can calmly explain what happened to your teacher. Honesty and staying level-headed are super important in situations like this—it’ll help show that you’re trustworthy.\n\nIf it was a coincidence, emphasize your own process for answering the questions. Maybe walk your teacher through how you came to your conclusions to prove your work was authentic. If you feel nervous, you could even ask for a meeting to clear things up privately. You’ve got this—just speak honestly and respectfully, and hopefully, everything will work out!"}
{"query": "I got left on read by my crush and it’s making me spiral.", "response": "Aw, I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Getting left on read can be a rough blow, especially when it's coming from someone you like. But try not to let it mess with your mind too much—it doesn’t always mean what we think it means! There could be so many reasons why your crush didn’t respond: maybe they’re busy, distracted, or just don’t know what to say yet. It doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not into you.\n\nGive yourself permission to breathe and not overthink it (I know that’s easier said than done). Maybe shift your focus for now—do something that makes you happy or gets your mind off things, like your favorite show, hanging out with friends, or working on a hobby. And remember: you’re awesome, and someone not replying doesn’t change that no matter what. 💛"}
{"query": "Someone took a picture of me without asking and posted it.", "response": "Oh no, that can be so frustrating and unfair! It sounds like your privacy wasn’t respected. Let’s figure out how to handle this. Here are a few steps you could take:\n\n1. **Reach Out to the Person**: If you know who posted the photo, politely ask them to take it down. Sometimes people don’t realize the impact of their actions, and communicating your discomfort can help.\n\n2. **Report the Photo**: If it’s on a social media platform, most platforms have options to report content for violating privacy. Look for a “report” button and follow their process.\n\n3. **Check the Platform’s Policies**: Social media sites often have rules against posting images of people without their consent, especially if it makes someone feel uncomfortable.\n\n4. **Speak to Someone You Trust**: If this situation is upsetting you, sharing your feelings with a trusted friend or family member can help.\n\n5. **Legal Options**: If you feel the post is seriously violating your privacy, you may want to consider talking to a lawyer or reviewing local laws. Depending on where you live, there might be legal protections against unauthorized sharing of photos.\n\nHow are you feeling about this? I’m here if you want to brainstorm further steps or just vent about it."}
{"query": "My friend keeps making ‘jokes’ that feel like insults.", "response": "Oh no, that’s tough! It sounds frustrating, especially when jokes cross the line into something that feels hurtful. Have you talked to your friend about how their comments make you feel? Sometimes people don’t realize their \"jokes\" are having a negative impact until someone calls it out. \n\nYou could try saying something like, \"Hey, I know you might not mean anything by it, but some of your jokes feel more like insults to me, and it kind of stings. Could you ease up on that?\" It’s casual but direct, and gives them room to reflect.\n\nIt’s also worth paying attention to how they react. A true friend should care about your feelings and make an effort to stop if they know it hurts you. If they keep doing it, though, it might be worth digging deeper—is this their sense of humor or is there something else going on? Let me know if you want ideas for handling that! 😊"}
{"query": "I’m stuck sitting alone at lunch today and it feels obvious.", "response": "Ah, I'm sorry to hear you're feeling that way. Sitting alone at lunch can definitely feel awkward, but you're not alone in experiencing this—everyone has been in a similar situation at some point. Here's something to keep in mind: being by yourself doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you, and it’s totally okay to have those solo moments sometimes.\n\nIf you're looking for ways to make it less uncomfortable, you could try bringing something to focus on. Maybe read a book, scroll or watch something on your phone, doodle, or even work on a project or homework. Giving yourself an activity might make the time feel less obvious or awkward.\n\nAlternatively, if you’re up for it, you could look around for a group of people who seem friendly and ask if you can join them. Most folks will be welcoming, even if it feels intimidating at first. Starting with a simple \"Mind if I sit here?\" can work wonders.\n\nSometimes these alone moments can also be an opportunity to just enjoy your own company. Sending you good vibes—you're doing great, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. 😊"}
{"query": "I just found out my friends hung out without inviting me.", "response": "Oh no, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. That can definitely sting, especially when you value your friendships. It's super normal to feel hurt or excluded in situations like this. Have you talked to them about it? Sometimes it could be an oversight or something unintentional—and it might help to hear their side. You deserve friends who make space for you. Want to chat more about it?"}
{"query": "My mom signed me up for something and didn’t ask me first.", "response": "Oh no! That can definitely feel frustrating—especially when you didn’t get a say in it. Do you know what she signed you up for? Maybe you can have a conversation with her about it and let her know how you’re feeling. She might've had good intentions, but it’s fair for you to express your thoughts too!"}
{"query": "My dad wants to talk about ‘my attitude’ and I’m already annoyed.", "response": "Ugh, I totally get that—you’re already bracing for a conversation that's probably going to feel frustrating or uncomfortable. But hey, maybe try not to look at this as a full-on attack (even though it feels that way right now). Parents usually mean well, even if their delivery could use some finesse.\n\nThat said, it might help to go into the talk ready to listen calmly—even if you don’t fully agree. If you show you're willing to hear him out, it’ll probably make the whole thing way less tense. Maybe even hit him with something like, “Okay, I’m open to hearing what you have to say,” so it doesn’t turn into a back-and-forth battle. It sounds cheesy, but staying chill might actually help.\n\nAlso, deep breaths—whatever he's bringing up doesn’t define you as a person. You got this! Want to talk strategy for how to respond if it starts going sideways?"}
{"query": "I have like five assignments due and my brain refuses to start.", "response": "Oh no, I feel you! When your brain digs its heels in and decides to take a timeout, it can be so frustrating, especially with deadlines looming. Sounds like it's time to gently coax it back into action without overwhelming yourself. Here's a game plan:\n\n### 1. **Break It Down**  \nStart super small. Pick the easiest assignment or even just one *tiny* step, like writing your name on the paper or opening the document. Sometimes tricking your brain into starting is all you need!\n\n### 2. **Prioritize**  \nFigure out what's most urgent or what's worth the most points. If decision fatigue is kicking in, just pick one randomly to work on. Moving forward—even haphazardly—is still progress.\n\n### 3. **Pomodoro It**  \nSet a timer for 25 minutes and focus on one task. When the timer’s up, take a quick break to stretch, scroll on your phone for a few minutes, or grab a snack. Keep things bite-sized so it doesn’t feel overwhelming.\n\n### 4. **Reward Yourself**  \nDangle a little carrot in front of yourself! Something like, “If I finish one assignment, I’ll treat myself to [insert your fave thing here].” Make it fun and motivating. \n\n### 5. **Change Your Environment**  \nSometimes a change of scene helps kickstart your brain. Work at a café, on the floor, in a park, or just move to a different spot in your house where you don’t normally work. Give your brain a little reset.\n\n### 6. **Be Kind to Yourself**  \nThis overwhelmed feeling is valid—you’re human, not a machine—and starting is often the hardest part. The fact that you’re even worried and reaching out shows you’re already inching toward action! \n\nWant help outlining a plan for one of your assignments? We could tackle it step by step!"}
{"query": "I think I might have said something rude and I didn’t mean it.", "response": "Oh no, that happens to the best of us! Sometimes things come out differently than we intended, and it’s totally okay to feel bad about it.

A simple apology goes a long way, especially when it's sincere—you’d be surprised how understanding people can be! Want to brainstorm what to say together?"}
{"query": "My coach yelled at me in front of everyone and I’m embarrassed.", "response": "Oh man, I’m really sorry you had to go through that—that sounds super rough. Getting called out like that, especially in front of others, can feel so humiliating and overwhelming. It’s natural to feel embarrassed, but try to remind yourself that one moment doesn’t define you, even if it feels huge right now.  \n\nHave you talked to your coach about how their approach made you feel? Sometimes they don’t realize the impact their actions have. If you feel comfortable, maybe you could pull them aside privately and explain how it affected you.  \n\nAlso, try not to beat yourself up over what happened. We’ve all had moments that make us cringe, but they don’t last forever. Focus on why you’re there—getting better, having fun, growing. What matters most is how you bounce back from this! You’re stronger than you think. 💪"}
{"query": "My friend keeps asking to copy my homework and I’m tired of it.", "response": "Ugh, that’s frustrating! It’s great that you want to protect your hard work. Have you tried talking to your friend about it? You could tell them, nicely but firmly, that while you’re happy to help explain concepts or study together, you’re not comfortable letting them copy your homework anymore. It’s important to set boundaries—it’s your effort, and it’s not fair for them to keep relying on you like that.\n\nIf you’re worried about them reacting badly, try framing it in a positive way, like:  \n\"Hey, I’ve noticed I’ve been sharing my homework with you a lot. I don’t mind helping you understand the material, but I think it’s better for both of us if you try doing the work yourself. Let’s figure this out together!\"  \n\nWhat do you think?

{"query": "I accidentally liked an old post while stalking someone.", "response": "Oh no, the classic accidental like—don't worry, you're not alone! It happens to *literally everyone* at some point, and while it might feel embarrassing, it's usually not a big deal. Here's what you can do:\n\n1. **Unlike It ASAP**: If you haven't already, just unlike the post quickly. Chances are, they won't get a notification if you acted fast enough.\n\n2. **Pretend It Never Happened**: If they *did* notice, most people won't make a big deal about it. You can just carry on like nothing happened, and odds are they'll just shrug it off.\n\n3. **Own It (Optional)**: If you're feeling bold, you could joke about it if they bring it up—something like, \"Whoops, got lost in your amazing content!\" can lighten the mood.\n\nRemember, people snoop social profiles all the time; it's totally normal.

{"query": "I’m pretty sure someone is mad at me but they won’t say why.", "response": "Oh man, that’s such a tough situation to be in—it can really feel frustrating and confusing. People often hold back from saying what's bothering them for all sorts of reasons: maybe they're trying to avoid conflict, maybe they don’t know how to bring it up, or maybe they’re still figuring out their feelings themselves.\n\nHave you tried gently asking them what’s going on? You could say something like, “Hey, I feel like things are a little off between us. Is something bothering you? I’d really like to talk about it if you’re up for it.” I know it can be nerve-wracking to initiate that kind of convo, but sometimes just showing that you’re open to hearing them out can help. \n\nIf they don’t want to talk right away, that’s okay; you’ve done your part by letting them know you’re willing to listen.

It's totally natural to feel upset about it, but maybe your teacher did it to help you focus or to mix things up in the classroom. Sometimes teachers think they're helping, even though it feels annoying in the moment.\n\nIf you want, you could try talking to your teacher about it. Maybe explain how you feel, but also try to stay calm and respectful—you might get a better understanding of why they made the change.

{"query": "I got told to ‘calm down’ and now I’m even less calm.", "response": "Ugh, I totally get it—that phrase can feel *so* frustrating. Being told to “calm down” often has the opposite effect, like lighting a fire instead of putting it out. It sounds dismissive, right? Like whoever said it isn’t really listening or understanding why you’re upset. You’re completely valid to feel, well... *not calm* right now.  \n\nMaybe take a sec to do something that helps you cool off in your own way, whether that’s stepping away, venting about it, or taking a few deep breaths (if you’re into that sort of thing). Whatever works for *you*, not just what someone else demands. 👏"}
{"query": "I didn’t get picked for the team and I’m trying to act fine.", "response": "Ah, I’m sorry to hear that—it really stings when something like that happens. It's totally okay to feel upset, even if you're trying to keep it cool on the outside. You put yourself out there, and that takes courage.\n\nThe thing to remember is this doesn’t define your worth or your abilities. Sometimes these moments are about timing, fit, or things that aren't even in your control. It’s hard, but it can also be an opportunity to focus on getting even better, or maybe explore a different path that could surprise you.\n\nDo you want to talk it through more? Sometimes venting helps! Or we could figure out a way to shift the focus to something that boosts your mood? Let me know what you need."}
{"query": "My friend is dating someone I really don’t trust.", "response": "Oh, that sounds like a tricky situation. It must feel weird or even stressful to see your friend with someone you don’t trust. Want to share a bit more about why you feel that way? Maybe it’ll help to get your thoughts out."}
{"query": "I overheard people talking about me in the hallway.", "response": "Oh no, that can feel really uncomfortable. Are you okay? Do you have any idea what they might have been saying? Sometimes it can be harmless, like people chatting casually, but if it’s bothering you, we could talk about what’s on your mind or come up with ways to handle it."}
{"query": "I have to choose classes for next year and I feel so behind.", "response": "Oh no, I'm sorry you're feeling that way! Choosing classes can feel overwhelming, but it's totally normal to feel a little uncertain. Wanna break it down together? Do you have some general ideas of what you'd like to focus on or explore? Or maybe you’re worried about meeting certain requirements or prerequisites? Let me know where you're stuck, and we’ll figure it out!"}
{"query": "My parents want my grades to be perfect and it’s stressing me out.", "response": "I'm so sorry you're feeling that way—it sounds like a lot of pressure, and that can be really hard to deal with. Parents usually push for good grades out of love and wanting the best for you, but sometimes it can feel overwhelming, like they're forgetting you’re human and that perfect isn’t realistic.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not be perfect—no one is! You're doing your best, and that's what matters most. Do you think you could talk to your parents about how their expectations are affecting you? Sometimes parents are more understanding than we expect when we share our feelings. You could try phrasing it like, \"I know you care about my success, and I want to do well too, but the pressure is starting to affect me in a negative way.\"\n\nAlso, do you have strategies to manage the stress? Things like breaking up your workload into smaller goals, taking breaks, getting enough sleep, or even dedicating some time to activities that make you happy (like hobbies or spending time with friends) can really help. If you’re open to it, I’d love to help brainstorm more ideas with you. Always remember, you're not alone, and your mental health and well-being should come first! ❤️"}
{"query": "Someone keeps texting me nonstop and I don’t know how to set a boundary.", "response": "Oh no, that sounds stressful! Setting boundaries can definitely be tough, but it’s really important, especially when someone starts invading your space like that. Here are a few simple steps you can try:\n\n1. **Pause Before Responding**  \n   Take a breath before replying. It’s okay not to respond immediately — you're not obligated to reply every time they text, especially if it’s starting to feel overwhelming.\n\n2. **Be Direct and Kind**  \n   You can let them know you're feeling a bit overwhelmed without being rude. Something like:  \n   *“Hey [their name], I’ve been really busy and feeling a little overwhelmed, so I might not reply as often for a bit. Hope you understand!”*  \n   This gives them a heads-up about your boundaries without being confrontational.\n\n3. **Use Silence as a Boundary**  \n   If you really feel like your message isn't being respected, it’s okay to stop engaging or replying to every text. Silence can send a pretty strong, respectful message too.\n\n4. **Consider Muting Notifications**  \n   If the constant messages are getting under your skin, mute their notifications for a while. Most phones let you mute specific conversations so you can create breathing room without blocking them (unless you need to).\n\n5. **Don’t Blame Yourself**  \n   It’s totally fine to want space—it doesn’t make you a bad person. If someone takes offense, that’s on them, not you.\n\nIf they’re really pushing boundaries and not respecting your polite boundary-setting, it’s okay to escalate to a more assertive tone or even block them if it feels like harassment.\n\nHow are you feeling about it so far? Do you want help coming up with specific wording for a text?"}
{"query": "I forgot my lunch and I’m trying not to be dramatic about it.", "response": "Aw, that's the worst! Honestly, forgetting your lunch is a total vibe killer, but you’re handling it a lot better than most would. Can you grab something nearby or swipe a snack from a friend? Worse comes to worst, you’ve got my moral support while you figure out what to do next! How hangry are we talkin’?"}
{"query": "My friend borrowed my stuff and returned it ruined.", "response": "Oh no, that's super frustrating! I'm really sorry to hear that. Have you had a chance to talk to your friend about it? Sometimes, bringing it up calmly can help avoid misunderstandings. Maybe you can ask them what happened and if they’d consider replacing or repairing the ruined item. If they're a good friend, they'll likely want to make it right! \n\nLet me know if you want help thinking through how to approach them—I'm here for you!"}
{"query": "I think my friend is lying to me and I don’t know how to ask.", "response": "Oof, that's such a tricky situation – I'm sorry you’re feeling that way. It can be tough to approach a situation where trust feels shaky, but being upfront, calm, and kind can help a lot. Here are some steps that might work for you:\n\n1. **Reflect First:** Before you confront your friend, take a moment to consider why you think they might be lying. Is it based on something you heard, a gut feeling, or inconsistencies in their story? Sorting through your thoughts and feelings will help you approach the conversation more clearly.\n\n2. **Pick the Right Moment:** Choose a time and place where you’re both comfortable and relaxed. Avoid confronting them in front of others or when emotions are already high.\n\n3. **Start with Curiosity, Not Accusation:** Instead of jumping straight into accusing them, ask questions or voice your concerns gently. For example:\n   - \"Hey, I’ve been feeling a little confused about [the situation], and I wanted to talk to you about it. Can you help me understand?”\n   - \"Something about [specific detail] doesn’t seem to line up, and I wanted to ask you about it.\"\n\n4. **Use “I” Statements:** Stick to how *you* feel rather than blaming them. For example:\n   - “I’ve been feeling unsure about what happened, and I just want to make sure we’re on the same page.”\n\n5. **Watch Their Reaction:** Pay attention to their body language and responses. If they get defensive or overly dismissive, that might be a sign something’s up. On the other hand, if they seem genuinely surprised that you’re questioning them, it might just be a misunderstanding.\n\n6. **Be Ready for Any Outcome:** They might admit they lied, or they might have a valid explanation that clears things up. Either way, try to give them room to share their side. If trust is broken and they *did* lie, be honest with yourself about how you feel moving forward.\n\nIt’s important to stay calm and prioritize kindness in how you approach your friend. Trust is a delicate thing, so conversations like this can feel like a balancing act. But if your friendship is solid, you should be able to navigate through it together! How are you feeling about the idea of bringing it up?"}
{"query": "My teacher called on me and my mind went completely blank.", "response": "Oh no, that can be such an awkward moment! But honestly, it happens to *everyone* — even the most confident, prepared people. When you get called on and your brain decides to take a little vacation, try not to beat yourself up over it. It doesn't mean you don't know the answer; sometimes nerves just take over.\n\nNext time, take a deep breath before speaking. You can even ask for the question to be repeated or say something like, “I need a second to gather my thoughts,” to give yourself a bit more time to reset. And worst-case scenario? Not knowing the answer is totally okay — every moment like that is just another chance to learn and improve. 💛"}
{"query": "I got in trouble for something I didn’t do.", "response": "Oh no, that totally sucks! I’m really sorry you’re going through that—it’s such a frustrating feeling to be blamed unfairly. Have you had the chance to explain your side of things to whoever is involved? Or is it one of those situations where no one’s really listening? Let me know if you'd like to talk it out or brainstorm ideas for handling it!"}
{"query": "I feel like my friends only talk to me when they need something.", "response": "Oh no, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. That can really hurt and leave you feeling unappreciated. Friendships are supposed to be about mutual care and connection, not just helping someone out all the time.\n\nHave you talked to your friends about this? Sometimes people don't even realize how their behavior is coming across. A gentle conversation could help them see how you’re feeling. Something like, \"Hey, I value our friendship a lot, but I’ve been feeling lately like I only hear from you when you need something. Can we try to spend more time just catching up or doing fun things together?\" might open the door to a better dynamic.\n\nAlso, how do *you* feel about the friendships overall? Do you enjoy being around them, or do you feel a bit drained? It might be worth reflecting on whether these relationships are leaving space for your needs, too, because you deserve to feel appreciated and cared for in friendships. ✨"}
{"query": "My parents won’t let me go out and everyone else can.", "response": "Ah, that’s rough—I’m sorry you’re feeling that way. It’s super frustrating when it feels like you’re the only one missing out. Have you had a conversation with your parents about it? Sometimes talking things through calmly can help. Like maybe you can ask them why they feel the way they do and suggest ways to compromise, like showing them you’re responsible or maybe giving them updates while you’re out. What do you think?"}
{"query": "I’m getting compared to my sibling again and it sucks.", "response": "Oh man, I’m sorry you’re dealing with that—it sounds really frustrating. Being compared to someone, especially a sibling, can feel unfair and exhausting. It’s like people forget you're your own person with your own strengths, interests, and unique qualities. Remember, you’re not defined by comparisons—you’re you, and that’s amazing enough. \n\nHave you tried talking to the person who's making the comparison? Sometimes they’re not even aware that it’s hurtful, and a little reminder can go a long way. Or if you need to vent more, I'm here to listen. Whatever you need!"}
{"query": "My crush smiled at me and now I’m overthinking everything.", "response": "Aw, that's so sweet! Sounds like you're really into them. 😊 It's super normal to overthink little moments when you have feelings for someone—it just means you care! Their smile could just mean they’re being friendly, but hey, it could also mean they like you back. Try not to spiral too much about it! The best way to get clarity is to interact with them more. \n\nNext time you see them, maybe strike up a casual conversation or find little ways to connect. Not everything needs decoding—you got this! And hey, if it’s meant to go somewhere, you’ll know in time. ✨"}
{"query": "I got paired with someone in class who literally hates me.", "response": "Ugh, I'm sorry you're dealing with that—it sounds so awkward and frustrating. Group assignments can already be tough, but adding personal tension doesn’t help. Do you know why they dislike you? Is it something you could address or clear the air about, or are they just being unfair for no reason?\n\nEither way, I’d suggest keeping things professional—focus on the work, not the drama. Sometimes people soften up when they see you’re being polite and productive. You don’t have to be besties, but staying chill and cooperative can keep things from spiraling while you both get the project done. If they’re truly unkind and disruptive, though, you could talk to the teacher about it if needed. You deserve to feel comfortable and respected in class!"}
{"query": "I’m pretty sure I’m the ‘backup friend’ and it hurts.", "response": "Oh man, I hear you, and that feeling is really tough. Being the \"backup friend\" can make you feel undervalued and even lonely sometimes, right? Like you're always there when they need you, but… not their first choice when it comes to spending time or sharing the big stuff. It’s okay to feel hurt—it’s valid.\n\nHave you talked to your friend(s) about how you’re feeling? Sometimes people don’t realize they’re making someone feel like a backup—they might not even mean to. Or maybe this could be a sign to reevaluate the relationships and focus on people who truly make you feel seen and valued. The right friendships will make you feel like a priority, not an afterthought.\n\nIf you want, we can brainstorm ways to address this or ways to make sure you're prioritizing yourself too, because you absolutely deserve great, fulfilling relationships!"}
{"query": "I want to quit an activity but I feel guilty.", "response": "Oh, I totally understand where you’re coming from—it’s hard to quit something, especially if you've invested time, energy, or emotions into it. Feeling guilty is normal, but here’s the thing: sometimes quitting isn’t about giving up, but about making space for the things that truly matter or work better for you.\n\nTake a little time to reflect on why you want to quit. Is it draining your energy? Is it no longer bringing you joy or fulfillment? Has your interest changed? Those are all valid reasons to move on.\n\nAlso, remember that quitting doesn’t erase the value of what you gained while doing the activity. Maybe you learned something, made connections, or grew in ways you didn’t expect—that stays with you regardless. And life changes—your interests, priorities, and obligations evolve, and it's okay to pivot!\n\nIf the guilt is coming from how quitting might affect other people, that’s understandable too. Maybe you feel like you’re letting someone down, but at the end of the day, *your happiness and well-being matter*. To help ease that guilt, you could explain your reasons to anyone impacted, if you feel comfortable doing so—most people will understand, especially if you're honest.\n\nYou're not \"wrong\" or \"weak\" for stepping away. Give yourself permission to move on gracefully—and without shame—if that's what's best for you. What's pulling you toward quitting? Let’s talk about it more if you like! 😊"}
{"query": "My friend keeps cancelling plans last minute.", "response": "Ugh, that’s frustrating, I totally get it. It can feel disappointing when someone keeps backing out, especially at the last minute. I’d say the best move here is to chat with your friend about it in a calm, easy-going way. Maybe something like: “Hey, I’ve noticed you’ve had to cancel plans a few times. Is everything okay?” \n\nThat way, you’re checking in, but also letting them know you’ve noticed the pattern. It could be that they’re overwhelmed, going through something, or just struggling to manage their time. Then you'll know if it's intentional or if they just didn’t realize it’s bugging you.  \n\nOf course, you're not obligated to keep making plans if this becomes a recurring thing. Respect your time, too! How’s it been making you feel?"}
{"query": "Someone keeps making comments about my body and I hate it.", "response": "I'm really sorry you're dealing with that—that sounds frustrating and uncomfortable. It's definitely not okay for someone to make comments about your body, especially if what they say bothers you. You deserve respect, and your boundaries should be honored.\n\nIf you feel comfortable doing so, you could try addressing the situation directly. A simple response like, “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t comment on my body,” or “Hey, I don’t like those kinds of comments,” can let the person know their behavior isn’t okay. Sometimes, people don’t realize their words are hurtful until you point it out.\n\nIf you don’t feel able to confront them, that’s totally valid too. In that case, it might help to set boundaries in other ways—like avoiding being around them or asking someone you trust for support, if that feels right.\n\nHow are you feeling about handling this? Do you want to talk it through more?"}
{"query": "I posted something and now I regret it.", "response": "Oh no, I hear you—it happens to the best of us! First off, don't stress too much; you're human, and we all make impulsive decisions sometimes. If you can, go ahead and delete or edit the post—it’s never too late to clean things up. \n\nIf it's already out there and people have seen it, you could even follow up with a new post acknowledging it, like, \"Hey, I changed my mind on that last post\" or \"Wasn't my best moment, sorry about that.\" Most people will appreciate your honesty.\n\nAnd remember, don’t beat yourself up! It’s a small moment in time, and everyone moves on way quicker than it feels in the moment. How are you feeling about it—just embarrassed or really worried?"}
{"query": "My friend told me they’re struggling and I don’t know how to help.", "response": "It’s really kind of you to want to help your friend! Sometimes just being there for someone can make a huge difference. Here are a few ideas to support them:\n\n1. **Listen without judgment** – Let them talk about what’s on their mind if they’re open to it. You don’t have to fix their problems or have all the answers—just listening with empathy is often enough.\n\n2. **Ask what they need** – Simply saying, *“How can I help?”* or *“What do you need from me right now?”* can show them that you care and are willing to support them in a way that works for them.\n\n3. **Check in regularly** – Even if your friend doesn’t want to talk in-depth, sending them a message or asking *“How are you doing today?”* can remind them that they’re not alone.\n\n4. **Offer practical help** – If they’re overwhelmed, maybe you can offer assistance with small tasks, like running errands, helping them with responsibilities, or even just sending funny memes to lighten their mood.\n\n5. **Encourage without pushing** – If your friend’s struggles seem bigger than they can handle alone, you could gently encourage them to talk to a professional. Say something like, *“It’s okay to reach out for help if you’re feeling this way. I can help you find resources if you need.”*\n\n6. **Be patient** – Sometimes people need time to open up or process their feelings. Just continuing to show your support, even if it feels like you aren’t doing much, matters a lot.\n\nRemember, your presence and kindness can mean so much to someone going through a tough time. It’s awesome that you care so much about your friend!"}
{"query": "I got a detention and I don’t even think it was fair.", "response": "Oh no, that sounds frustrating! I'm sorry you're dealing with that. What happened? If you feel like it wasn’t fair, maybe we can think about how you could talk to your teacher or explain your side of the story."}
{"query": "I’m nervous about talking to the school counselor.", "response": "Aw, I totally understand feeling that way. Talking to someone about things on your mind can feel intimidating at first—but remember, school counselors are there to help you. They’re trained to listen and support you, not judge or criticize. \n\nIt might help to think about what you want to share with them or even jot down a few notes ahead of time. If you’re really nervous, you could start by saying, “I’m a little nervous about this” or “I’m not sure how to say this.” They’ll get it—they’re used to helping students work through their feelings.\n\nYou’ve got this, though! Taking this step shows how brave you are, and getting some guidance could really help. Would it help to talk more about what you're nervous about?"}
{"query": "I feel like I’m always the one starting conversations.", "response": "Aww, I hear you—that can definitely be tiring and a little frustrating at times. It sometimes feels like you're putting in all the effort, right? Don't get discouraged, though. Some people genuinely aren't great at initiating or might be dealing with stuff in their own lives that makes them a little withdrawn. Have you ever brought it up with your friends or the people you're reaching out to? Sometimes, a casual chat about how you feel can open up new doors for them to realize they need to step up.  \n\nAlso, it’s worth thinking about *who* you’re consistently starting conversations with. Are they people who are just quieter or not as communicative? Maybe it's time to see if you're putting a lot of energy into relationships that aren't matching your vibe. \n\nConnection is a two-way street, so don't feel bad about setting boundaries and focusing on people who reciprocate. You're awesome for caring enough to keep conversations going!"}
{"query": "My friend’s parents don’t like me and it’s awkward.", "response": "Oh no, that sounds really tough and awkward—I’m sorry you're dealing with that! Do you have any idea why they might not like you? Sometimes it’s based on misunderstandings or assumptions, and it might not be fair to you.\n\nIf you're close to your friend and feel comfortable, you could ask them if they know what's going on. It could be something small that you can address, like maybe they don’t know you very well yet. You could try being extra polite and thoughtful when you interact with them—sometimes people just need time to warm up to someone.\n\nIf they’re just being stubborn or judgmental for no real reason, though, try not to take it personally. People can have strange opinions about things. In the meantime, focus on your friendship—your bond with your friend matters the most! How’s your friend handling it?"}
{"query": "I think I might like someone but I don’t know if it’s mutual.", "response": "Ah, that sounds exciting and a little nerve-wracking at the same time!

First off, your feelings matter, and if something doesn’t sit right with you, trust that instinct. A good friend should respect your boundaries.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, try calmly explaining how you feel. You could say something like, “Hey, I understand why this is important to you, but I’m not comfortable with it. I hope you can respect that.” If they’re truly your friend, they’ll listen. And if they don’t… well, that might be something to think about.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have every right to say “no” when it comes to your own comfort or values. You’ve got this!"}
{"query": "I walked into the wrong classroom and everyone stared.", "response": "Oh no, that can be *so awkward*! But honestly, it happens to everyone at least once.

It'll just be a funny little moment in the grand scheme of things. You got this! 😄"}
{"query": "I lost something important at school and I’m freaking out.", "response": "Oh no, I'm so sorry you're feeling this way—it sounds really stressful. Losing something important can definitely be overwhelming, but don’t worry! Let’s take it one step at a time and work on getting it back. \n\nFirst, try to retrace your steps:  \n- Where were you last when you had the item?  \n- Did you move around a lot during school?  \n\nCheck obvious spots, like your desk, locker, bag, or anywhere you were sitting. Maybe ask some friends or classmates if they’ve seen it, and let your teacher or someone in authority know about it—they might be able to help.  \n\nIf you feel comfortable, you can also ask the school office or lost and found section. Most schools have a system for collecting lost items!\n\nDo you know roughly where you might have left it? I can think of more ideas if you need help. You’ve got this!"}
{"query": "My friend keeps gossiping and I don’t want to be part of it.", "response": "Oh, I totally get that! Gossip can be such a tricky thing to navigate, especially when you don't want to participate. It sounds like you're really thoughtful about how you handle these situations, which is awesome. \n\nIf you want to step away from the gossip without making it awkward, you could gently steer the conversation in another direction. For example, you could say something like, \"Oh, I'm not sure about all that, but hey, how's [insert something positive or neutral here] going?\" This keeps things light and shows you’re interested in connecting, but not in a gossipy way.\n\nAnother option is to be honest, but nice! You could say, \"I’m trying to stay away from talking about other people—it's been helping me feel a lot better. What's new with you?\" That lets your friend know where you stand without making it a big deal.\n\nIf the gossip keeps coming up, and it’s rubbing you the wrong way, it’s okay to set a boundary too. You could say, “Hey, I really value my friendship with you, but I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about other people. Can we chat about something else?”\n\nPeople who care about you will respect your choice, and honestly, they might even take cues from you to look at gossiping differently themselves! 😊"}
{"query": "I’m getting stressed for no reason and I can’t shut my brain off.", "response": "Oh no, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Stress can be such a heavy feeling, especially when it's hard to pinpoint why it’s happening. The good news is you’re not alone, and there are things you can try to help calm your mind.\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n### 1. **Breathe it out**\n   - Take some deep breaths: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale for 6 seconds. Repeat this a few times. It sounds simple, but it can really help signal your brain to slow down.\n\n### 2. **Ground yourself**\n   - Try the **5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique**: Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. It’s a great way to refocus your thoughts and get out of your head.\n\n### 3. **Write it out**\n   - Sometimes putting your thoughts on paper can relieve some of the mental chaos. You don’t have to make it perfect—just jot down what’s bouncing around in your brain.\n\n### 4. **Move your body**\n   - Even a quick stretch or walk can work wonders. Physical movement shakes up the stress chemicals in your body and gives your brain a needed reset.\n\n### 5. **Limit stimulation**\n   - If your brain feels overloaded, dim the lights, step away from your phone or computer for a bit, and give yourself some quiet. Sometimes reducing external input can help ease internal chaos.\n\n### 6. **Give yourself permission to feel**\n   - It's okay to have moments like this, and you don’t have to fight them. Remind yourself that this feeling will eventually pass—it’s not permanent.\n\nIf it feels like this happens regularly or it's tough to manage on your own, it might be a good idea to chat with a mental health professional. They can offer extra tools to help. For now, remember: you’re doing the best you can, and even small steps matter. ❤️ Would you like to dive into one of these ideas together?"}
{"query": "My parents want to talk about college and I’m only in like… tenth grade.", "response": "Ah, yeah, that definitely sounds early! I get why it feels like a lot—you're still figuring out high school and they’re already pushing the college agenda. Parents sometimes start those conversations early because college planning (and saving for it) can take time, and they probably want you to have options.\n\nBut hey, you don’t need to stress right now. College stuff isn’t about picking a school or a major in tenth grade—it’s more like exploring what you might be into. Are they asking you about future careers or just talking about schools? Maybe they just want to set up a prep vibe like grades, extracurriculars, or steps to keep in mind later. You can let them know you’re not ready to make decisions but that you’re happy to brainstorm and go at a chill pace. It’s good practice for these kinds of talks where everyone can share their thoughts without pressure, you know?"}
{"query": "I think my teacher hates me and I don’t know why.", "response": "Oh no, I'm sorry you're feeling this way! That sounds frustrating and tough to deal with. Can you tell me a little more about what makes you feel like your teacher hates you? Sometimes people act a certain way and it’s not personal, but maybe there’s been a misunderstanding or something going on that you’re picking up on. Let’s chat and figure it out together!"}
{"query": "Someone keeps teasing me and I can’t tell if it’s bullying.", "response": "Ugh, being teased can definitely be tough to navigate. Let’s try and figure this out together!\n\nFirst, it’s important to think about *how* the teasing feels to you. Does it seem playful, or does it make you feel embarrassed, upset, or uncomfortable? Playful teasing is usually light-hearted, and the person doing it doesn’t intend to hurt you—they might immediately back off if you ask them to stop. Bullying, on the other hand, is meant to be hurtful or make you feel bad, and it tends to be repeated even if you express that you don’t like it.\n\nA good way to tell the difference is how the person reacts when you set boundaries. If you let them know their teasing is bothering you, do they apologize or stop? Or do they keep doing it, ignore how you feel, or even escalate it? If it feels persistent, mean-spirited, or targeted, it’s leaning more toward bullying.\n\nHere’s an idea: try calmly letting them know how it makes you feel. For example, you could say something like, “Hey, I know you might be joking, but that’s starting to bother me.” A person who’s just playfully teasing will usually respect your feelings. If they don’t stop or start acting worse, then it’s completely okay to label this behavior as bullying—and you can loop in a trusted adult, teacher, or friend to help you deal with it.\n\nHow are you feeling about it, though? Want to share more details? I’m here to help however I can."}
{"query": "My friend got mad because I hung out with someone else.", "response": "Ah, that sounds like a tricky situation. It can be upsetting when feelings get involved like that. It might be worth having a calm and honest conversation with your friend to understand why they’re feeling mad. Maybe they're feeling left out or worried about something? Be empathetic, but also let them know it’s okay for you to hang out with other people—I mean, friendships aren’t meant to be exclusive! Something like “Hey, I noticed you seemed upset, and it’s important to me that we’re good—can we talk about it?” might open up the conversation in a gentle way.\n\nHow do you feel about their reaction?"}
{"query": "I’m scared I’m going to fail this class.", "response": "Aw, I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling that way. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure, but remember, you're not alone in this. Struggling in a class doesn’t mean failure—it’s actually part of learning and growing, even if it doesn’t feel great right now.\n\nWhy do you think you’re going to fail? Is it the coursework, test anxiety, or something else? Maybe we can figure out some steps together to make things feel a bit more manageable. You’ve got this, and I’m here to help!"}
{"query": "I have to do a partner dance in PE and I want to die of embarrassment.", "response": "Aw, I hear you—it can definitely feel super awkward at first! Partner dancing puts you out of your comfort zone, but the good news is that *everyone* in your class probably feels a little uncomfortable, so you're not alone. \n\nHere are a few ideas to help:  \n1. **Laugh it off.** If you mess up or feel weird, try to just laugh about it! Keeping it light will make it less stressful.  \n2. **Focus on the steps.** Think about the moves more than the fact that it’s a partner dance. Pretend it’s just a fun game you’re trying to ace!  \n3. **Fake confidence.** Even if you're cringing internally, just pretend like you’re cool with it. Fake it till you make it—that attitude can actually do wonders.  \n4. **Remember it’s temporary.** It’ll be over soon, and in the grand scheme of things, it’s just one class. You’ll live to tell the tale.  \n\nBonus tip: Sometimes choosing to make it fun instead of fighting it halves the embarrassment. You’ve got this, and hey, you might even end up laughing about it later with friends! 💃🕺"}
{"query": "My friend keeps making everything a competition.", "response": "Ugh, that can be frustrating! Some people can’t help themselves—it’s like they live for one-upping or comparing. If it's bothering you, it’s totally fair to bring it up gently. You could say something like, \"Hey, I've noticed you sometimes turn things into a bit of a competition, and it’s not really my vibe. Can we keep things more chill?\" Approach it with kindness so they don’t feel like you’re attacking them.\n\nAnd if you don’t want a big conversation about it, you can just “opt out” when they start doing their competitive thing. You could change the subject or say something like, \"It’s not a competition, we’re both awesome,\" with a lighthearted tone to defuse the situation. Hopefully, they'll get the hint!"}
{"query": "My parents are being extra strict for no reason.", "response": "Oh no, that sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry you're feeling that way—it can be super tough when it feels like your parents are being strict, especially if you don’t understand why. Have you tried talking to them calmly about how you're feeling? Sometimes just having an open conversation can help clear things up. Maybe there’s a specific reason for their behavior, or you can explain how their strictness is affecting you. \n\nIf they’re not open to talking, maybe showing them through actions that you’re responsible and trustworthy could help ease things over time. Want to share a bit more about the situation? I’m here to listen!"}
{"query": "I got invited somewhere but I don’t know anyone else going.", "response": "Oh, I totally get that feeling – it can be nerve-wracking! But honestly, it could be an awesome opportunity to meet new people and step out of your comfort zone. You’ve already got common ground with whoever invited you, so maybe stick close to them at first as a starting point.  \n\nAnd here’s a little confidence booster: The people there don’t know you yet either! You might make a great impression and even connect with someone you hit it off with. Just be yourself, maybe ask some open-ended questions like, “How do you know [the host]?” or “What made you decide to come today?” to spark a convo.  \n\nYou'll be totally fine – who knows, it might turn into a fun, surprising experience!"}
{"query": "I feel like everyone has a ‘thing’ and I don’t.", "response": "Ah, I hear you. It’s easy to look around and feel like everyone has their own unique “thing,” something they’re passionate about or good at, and wonder why you don’t have yours figured out. But here's what I want to say—just because it doesn't feel like you have a “thing” *right now* doesn't mean you don’t or won’t. Discovering what lights you up can take time, reflection, and even trial and error.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes the idea of having a singular \"thing\" is overrated. People can find fulfillment in many small interests or ways instead of dedicating themselves to one defining passion. You might already have tiny pieces of a \"thing,\" but you just haven’t given yourself credit for them yet! Do you lose track of time when you’re doodling, writing, cooking, exploring music? Do you love just being there for your friends, fixing things, finding cool facts, or organizing spaces? All those things *matter*, and they’re as valid as someone who’s really into painting murals or playing the guitar in a band.\n\nThe best way forward might be to let yourself get curious. Try new hobbies, revisit old ones, or explore interests you’ve always thought about but never took the leap on—without feeling pressure for them to be “your thing.” Sometimes it’s just about trusting that the right passion will connect with you naturally when it’s ready.\n\nAlso, it’s really worth remembering that you don’t *need* to have a single “thing” to be interesting or valuable. You’re enough just by being you, even if your “thing” is figuring things out. That’s pretty amazing all on its own."}
{"query": "My friend asked me to keep a secret that feels serious.", "response": "That sounds like a tricky situation to be in. It's really thoughtful of you to take your friend's trust seriously, but it can definitely feel heavy if the secret seems serious. First, ask yourself a couple of questions:\n\n1. Is this secret something that puts your friend—or anyone else—in harm's way? Like, is it dangerous or something you feel could have consequences that need outside help?  \n2. Are you struggling with keeping this secret because it feels like too much for one person to handle?\n\nIf it's just big but not harmful, it can help to gently encourage your friend to talk to someone who can support them—whether that's another trusted loved one or a professional (like a counselor). You don't have to solve it all on your own.\n\nIf it's something unsafe, though, it might be important to let someone who can help know, even if you go against the promise to keep it private. When someone's well-being is at risk, safety often outweighs secrecy.\n\nYou’re in a tough spot, so remember: it's okay to seek advice or support for yourself too, even if you can’t share the details. How are you feeling about it all?"}
{"query": "Someone I don’t like keeps trying to be friends with me.", "response": "Ugh, that can totally feel awkward and uncomfortable. It’s okay not to click with everyone or want to be close friends with someone who isn’t your vibe. It sounds like this person might not be picking up on that, so here are a few ideas for how to handle it:\n\n1. **Set Boundaries**: If they keep pushing for more connection, it’s okay to gently let them know you’re not looking to deepen the friendship. For example: “Hey, I really appreciate the effort you’re making, but I’m keeping things low-key right now and not looking to expand my social circle too much.”\n\n2. **Be Polite but Distant**: Sometimes staying polite while not encouraging their efforts can send the message. Keep conversations short, and avoid making plans or saying things they might interpret as invitations to hang out more.\n\n3. **Limit Availability**: If they’re texting or inviting you to things, you don’t have to respond quickly or overshare. You can take your space and politely decline when you don’t feel like engaging.\n\n4. **Trust Your Gut**: If you feel like this person is crossing boundaries or being pushy, it’s 100% okay to prioritize your peace of mind over their feelings.\n\nIt’s not your job to be friends with everyone, and you’re allowed to focus on relationships that feel good and mutually respectful. Hopefully, they take the hint, and you can avoid any drama!"}
{"query": "I’m nervous to eat in front of people at school.", "response": "Oh, I'm sorry you're feeling that way—it's really common, so you're definitely not alone in this! Eating in front of others can feel nerve-wracking, especially in a social setting like school where it feels like people are watching. But honestly, most people are super focused on their own stuff—what they're eating, talking about, or thinking—and aren’t paying much attention to other people’s eating habits.\n\nTo help ease the nerves a little, here are some tips:\n\n1. **Start small**: Maybe eat with someone you feel comfortable with at first, like a close friend or a small group, rather than a big crowd. Having familiar faces around can be calming.\n   \n2. **Choose food you're comfy with**: Bring something that feels easy to eat in public, like finger foods, sandwiches, or snacks. If eating feels less complicated, it can help take the pressure off.\n\n3. **Practice positive self-talk**: If you catch yourself worrying about what others think, try reminding yourself that eating is super normal, and everyone does it—it’s literally just part of being a human!\n\n4. **Build up gradually**: If you feel extreme fear, you could start by drinking water or having a small bite while sitting around others, and then work your way up when you feel ready.\n\n5. **Find your mindset**: Sometimes focusing on the moment—like enjoying your food—can quiet anxious thoughts. Try to tune out the surroundings when you eat and focus on how tasty your meal is!\n\nIf it's something that keeps feeling overwhelming, it could also help to talk to someone you trust about it—like a parent, school counselor, or friend. You're allowed to feel this way, and it’s okay to work through it at your own pace.\n\nYou've got this! The more practice you get, the easier it will feel over time. 😊 "}
{"query": "I just got told ‘we need to talk’ and I’m terrified.", "response": "Oh man, I totally get why you'd be anxious—those words are never fun to hear! But try not to spiral just yet. \"We need to talk\" doesn't automatically mean something bad. It could be about something they need clarity on, or maybe they're feeling nervous themselves and want to address something important. \n\nTake a deep breath and remind yourself that you can handle this, no matter what it is. When the conversation happens, just try to stay open-minded, listen, and stay calm. You've got this! Want to talk about anything else to help distract yourself or prepare?"}
{"query": "My friend keeps sending me snaps at like 2am and I’m exhausted.", "response": "Ugh, I totally feel you on that! It’s sweet that your friend wants to stay connected, but 2am snaps? That’s rough when you're trying to sleep or just recharge. Maybe you could gently mention it to them? Something like, \"Hey, I love your snaps, but if you hit me up during the day, I'll actually be awake to appreciate them!\" \n\nIf you’re not ready for that convo, you could try putting your phone on Do Not Disturb mode at night—game changer for uninterrupted sleep! 😴"}
{"query": "My parents keep asking who I’m texting.", "response": "Oh no, that can definitely feel a bit annoying! Maybe they're just curious and trying to stay involved in your life, but I get how it could come across as intrusive. If it’s bothering you, you could try calmly explaining something like, “Hey, I promise I’ll tell you if it’s anything important, but sometimes I just need my space to chat with friends.” That shows you're open but also setting a boundary. \n\nOr if you're feeling chill about it, you could play it off lightheartedly — like \"Oh, just texting my secret agents!\" and deflect the question. Balance is key, and I'm sure they'll ease up if you approach it with honesty and humor. What do you think?"}
{"query": "I can’t tell if someone is flirting with me or just being nice.", "response": "Ah, classic dilemma – it can be tough to tell sometimes! People have different ways of expressing themselves, so figuring out if someone is flirting or just being friendly often comes down to context and the vibe they’re giving off. Here are a few things that might help you decode the situation:\n\n### Signs They Might Be Flirting:\n1. **Playful Teasing or Banter**: Are they joking around with you or lightly teasing you in a fun, non-mean way? That can be a sign of flirting.\n2. **Compliments That Feel Personal**: Compliments about your looks, personality, or something specific about you (versus generic nice comments) could be their way of showing interest.\n3. **Body Language**: Do they lean in when they talk to you, make frequent eye contact, and smile a bit too much? Flirty body language tends to be a little extra.\n4. **Prolonging Conversations**: If they seem to find reasons to keep chatting with you or bring up random topics to keep you engaged, they might be interested.\n5. **Using Touch**: Do they casually touch your arm, shoulder, or hand when talking to you? Physical touch is often a flirty move (if it feels natural and respectful).\n6. **Hinting at Spending Time Together**: If they bring up \"we should hang out\" or suggest doing something in the future, that’s often a sign they like being around you.\n\n### Signs They’re Just Being Nice:\n1. **Politeness Outdoors**: Some people just naturally go out of their way to be kind and kind-hearted… especially in professional settings!"}
{"query": "I got grounded and it feels unfair.", "response": "Aw man, I’m sorry that happened. That really sucks. Getting grounded can definitely feel unfair, especially if you don’t think you deserve it. Want to talk about what happened? Maybe I can help you see it from a different perspective or brainstorm ways to handle it!"}
{"query": "I’m stuck in a friend group where people are always arguing.", "response": "Ugh, that’s so tough—I’m sorry you're dealing with that! Constant arguing in a friend group can be super draining, especially if you're caught in the middle or just trying to keep the peace. Let’s talk through some ideas that might help.\n\nFirst off, do you feel like you’re directly involved in the arguments, or are you more like a bystander while everyone else goes at it? If you’re more on the sidelines, you could try setting some boundaries, like letting everyone know you don’t want to be involved in all the drama. Maybe say something like, \"I care about everyone here, but I’m not comfortable being stuck in the middle when there’s fighting.\"\n\nIf the arguments are really toxic or nonstop, it might be time to take a step back and spend a little less time with the group. That doesn’t mean you have to cut ties completely, but giving yourself some space could help you figure out how you feel and whether this group dynamic is worth sticking around for.\n\nAlso—this might be obvious, but have you tried calmly pointing out that the arguing is becoming an issue for you? Sometimes people don’t even realize how much tension they’re creating. You could say something gentle, like, \"I feel like there’s been a lot of disagreements lately, and it’s kind of hard to be around. Is there anything we can all talk about to make things better?\"\n\nAt the end of the day, friendships should feel *good* overall, not exhausting or full of conflict. You deserve relationships that make you feel happy and supported—so try to evaluate whether this friend group is really giving you that.\n\nWhat do you think so far? I’m here to brainstorm more if you need!"}
{"query": "I messed up in front of everyone and I can’t stop replaying it.", "response": "Oh no, I’m so sorry you’re feeling like that—it’s such a tough spot to be in. Honestly, most of us have had those moments where we can’t stop replaying our mistakes, and it’s absolutely draining. But you know what? People are generally so much less focused on your slip-up than you think. Like, they’ve got their own lives, their own mishaps, their own inner monologues going on.\n\nGive yourself some grace. Mess-ups happen to literally every single person, and they’re such a small part of who you are. If it helps, maybe try reminding yourself that this moment doesn’t define you—it’s one tiny blip in the grand scheme of your life.\n\nWhen the replay starts, try saying to yourself, \"Hey, I’ve acknowledged this already, it’s okay for me to let it go now.\" Or distract yourself with something fun or calming—a show, music, journaling, or texting a friend about something unrelated. \n\nYou might be feeling like everyone is laser-focused on you, but trust me: people are *way* more forgiving than our minds let us believe. You’re gonna bounce back! ❤️"}
{"query": "My friend is being super clingy and I need space.", "response": "Oh, I totally get how that can feel overwhelming! It’s great that you recognize you need some space, though—it’s important to set boundaries for your own well-being. Here are a couple of ways you can approach this gently but firmly:\n\n1. **Be Honest (but Kind):** Let your friend know how you’re feeling in a calm and caring way. You could say something like, “Hey, I really value our friendship, but I’ve been feeling like I need a little more space to recharge. I hope you understand!”\n\n2. **Focus on Yourself (Without Blaming):** Emphasize that it’s about what you need, not about anything wrong with them. For example, “I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed lately, and I need a little alone time to catch my breath.”\n\n3. **Set Clear Boundaries:** If they’re texting or reaching out constantly, you could establish some boundaries like, “Sometimes I’m not great at replying immediately, so don’t take it personally if I take some time to respond.”\n\n4. **Suggest Some Balance:** If you want to keep things chill but also provide a gentle nudge, you could say something like, “I love hanging out, but I think it’d be good if we both had some of our own time too.”\n\nThe key is to approach it with kindness so that they don’t feel hurt, but also make sure you’re advocating for your own needs. Hopefully with a little communication, they’ll understand where you’re coming from and the friendship can stay healthy and fun! Do you want help figuring out exactly what to say?"}
{"query": "Someone said something racist/sexist in class and the teacher ignored it.", "response": "Oh no, that's really upsetting to hear! It's tough when someone says something harmful or offensive, and the adults in the room don't address it. If you're feeling uncomfortable about it, here are a few things you could consider:\n\n1. **Talk to the teacher privately** - Sometimes, teachers miss things or aren't sure how to respond. You could approach them after class or send an email to let them know how the comment impacted you and that you'd like to see them address it in some way.\n\n2. **Speak up yourself (if you feel safe to do so)** - If this happens again, you could respectfully call it out by saying something like, \"I don’t think that’s okay to say,\" or \"That comment feels hurtful or disrespectful to me.\" It's not your responsibility to \"fix\" this, but standing up calmly can sometimes make a big difference.\n\n3. **Talk to a counselor or another trusted adult** - If the teacher continues to ignore harmful comments or this situation is upsetting, sharing what happened with someone you trust at school could ensure that the issue is addressed. Counselors or administrators could step in to help.\n\n4. **Write it down** - If this is an ongoing issue, documenting what happened (dates, quotes, context) might help if you decide to escalate the matter later.\n\nNone of this should have fallen on you—it’s frustrating when people in authority don’t do their part to call out racism or sexism. Take care of yourself, and remember, your feelings here are valid. You're allowed to feel upset and to want better behavior in your classroom."}
{"query": "I keep procrastinating and now everything is piling up.", "response": "Oh no, I totally get how overwhelming that can feel. Procrastination has a sneaky way of making things snowball. The good news is, you can tackle it step by step! Let’s work on making things a little less intimidating.  \n\nFirst, can you jot down everything you need to do? Getting it out of your head and onto paper (or a note app) can help lighten the mental load. Once you have that, try focusing on just one small task—something quick or easy—just to build some momentum.  \n\nAnd hey, if the thought of starting still feels overwhelming, maybe you can set a super short timer, like 10 or 15 minutes, and just chip away.

{"query": "I got a bad grade and I’m scared to tell my parents.", "response": "Aw, I’m sorry you’re feeling this way! I know it can be really stressful, but it’s important to be honest with your parents—they’ll appreciate your honesty even if they’re not thrilled about the grade. Here's a friendly little plan to help ease the conversation:\n\n1. **Prepare What You Want to Say**: Think about how you’ll explain the situation. Is this grade part of a tough subject? Did you struggle with a particular assignment or test? Share what happened honestly.\n\n2. **Take Ownership and Show Effort**: Acknowledge the grade without making excuses, and talk about any steps you’re already taking to improve (like studying more, asking for help, or working on better habits).\n\n3. **Pick a Good Time**: Find a calm moment to bring it up—not during a busy or stressful time. Say something like, “Can we talk about school? I need to be honest about something.”\n\n4. **Be Open to Conversations**: Your parents might be upset or disappointed, and that’s okay. Try to stay calm and listen to what they have to say—they probably just want to help.\n\nRemember, one bad grade won’t define you. Everyone struggles sometimes, and your parents likely care more about your honesty and effort than the actual number. You got this!"}
{"query": "I think my friend is using me to get closer to someone else.", "response": "Oof, that's a tough situation, and I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. That kinda stuff can hit hard. If you're sensing that your friend’s actions are more about someone else than about you, it’s worth taking a step back and figuring out how you want to handle it.\n\nFirst, trust your gut—it sounds like you’ve picked up on something, but it’s always worth asking yourself if there could be other reasons behind their behavior. Sometimes people act in ways that don’t even realize hurt others, you know?\n\nHave you considered talking to your friend about it? Not in a confrontational way, but just by expressing how you feel. Like, “Hey, I’ve been feeling a little unsure about our friendship lately—can we talk?” That opens up space for them to reflect and respond, and maybe they'll realize how their actions are coming across.\n\nBut, ultimately, you deserve to be treated like a real friend, not a stepping stone. If they’re not giving you that same care and respect, it might be time to create emotional boundaries so their actions don’t weigh on you as much.\n\nHow’re you holding up?"}
{"query": "My friend’s new friends are kinda mean and it’s changing them.", "response": "Ah, that’s tough. It sounds like their new friends might be having a negative impact on them, and you're noticing how it's affecting your friend’s behavior. It’s really hard to watch someone you care about change in ways that don’t feel good.\n\nHave you talked to your friend about how you’re feeling? Sometimes people don’t realize the impact that their friendships or actions have on others until someone gently points it out. You don’t want to attack or judge them, but you could try saying something like, “Hey, I’ve noticed some changes in the way you’ve been acting lately, and I’m kind of worried about you. Are you okay?” This shows you care and opens the door for a conversation.\n\nIt’s also possible your friend doesn’t see their new friends the same way you do, or maybe they feel like they have to act a certain way to fit in. Either way, reinforcing your support and letting them know you’re there no matter what can help them feel grounded.\n\nWhat do you think? Would talking to them feel comfortable for you?"}
{"query": "I want to change how I look but I’m scared people will comment.", "response": "Hey, I understand how you feel—it can be nerve-wracking to make a change, especially when you’re worried about what others might say. But here’s the thing: you deserve to feel good about yourself and how you look, and if making a change feels right for *you*, that’s what matters most.\n\nPeople might comment, but remember, most people’s opinions are short-lived—and honestly, folks are dealing with their own stuff. And if anyone gives you a hard time, it’s usually a reflection of them, not you. Positive people will support your decisions and may even admire your courage in doing something that makes you happy!\n\nMaybe start with small changes to boost your confidence. That way, you can ease into it without feeling overwhelmed. And once you own your look and radiate confidence, it’ll be hard for anyone to question it. Be true to yourself—you’ve got this!"}
{"query": "I’m getting headaches from stress and I don’t know what to do.", "response": "Ugh, stress headaches are the worst—I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. Luckily, there are a few things you can try to ease the pain and hopefully prevent them in the future. Let’s start with what you can do right now:\n\n### Immediate relief:\n- **Drink water:** Stress can leave your body dehydrated, even if you don’t realize it. A headache can sometimes be your body’s way of saying it needs more H2O.\n- **Rest your eyes:** If you’ve been looking at a screen or focusing intensely, give your eyes a break. Close them for a few minutes or try the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds).\n- **Try deep breathing:** Taking a few slow, deliberate breaths might calm your nervous system and ease stress-related symptoms. Try breathing in for 4 counts, holding for 4 counts, and exhaling for 6 counts.\n- **Massage your temples or neck:** Tension headaches often stem from tight muscles in the head, neck, or shoulders. Rubbing gently in those areas could help.\n- **Use a warm or cold compress:** A heating pad or a cold washcloth on your forehead or the back of your neck can feel really soothing.\n\n### Longer-term stress management:\nIf recurring stress headaches are becoming a thing, it might help to tackle the stress itself:\n- **Move your body:** Exercise doesn’t have to be intense—even a walk or stretching can release tension and boost endorphins (your brain’s happy chemicals).\n- **Get enough sleep:** Lack of sleep can make stress hit harder. Try winding down with a regular bedtime routine to help your body recharge.\n- **Practice mindfulness or meditation:** Even a few minutes a day of self-reflection, journaling, or guided meditation could help you feel more grounded.\n- **Talk it out:** If you feel comfortable, open up to someone you trust about what’s stressing you out. Sometimes venting can lighten the load.\n  \n### When to get help:\nIf the headaches don’t let up, keep getting worse, or start interfering with your day-to-day life, it might be good to see a doctor. They can help rule out anything serious and maybe suggest other treatments.\n\nStress is tough, but you’ve got this! You’re already taking a good step by recognizing it’s something you want to work on. Anything else I can help with?"}
{"query": "Someone keeps ‘joking’ about fighting me and it’s not funny anymore.", "response": "Oh no, that sounds super frustrating. When jokes hit a point where they aren't funny anymore, especially if they make you feel uncomfortable, it’s time to set some boundaries. Have you tried calmly telling this person that you don’t find it funny and asking them to stop?  \n\nSometimes people think they’re being playful or don’t realize their \"joke\" is bothering someone. You could say something direct but calm, like, “Hey, you keep joking about fighting me, but I don’t find it funny anymore. It’s starting to bother me, so can you please stop?”  \n\nIf they’re a decent person, they should respect that, but if they don’t, it might be time to just distance yourself or get support from others if needed. No one deserves to feel uncomfortable in their interactions!"}
{"query": "I feel left out even when I’m literally with my friends.", "response": "Oh man, I hate that you're feeling that way, and I know that can sting—it’s rough to feel like you're present but invisible, right? Sometimes being surrounded by people can feel lonelier than being physically alone.\n\nDo you know if there’s anything specific that’s putting you in that headspace? Like, are your friends talking about things you’re not involved in, or you feel like you're not being heard, or maybe there's a vibe that’s off? I promise, we can unpack this together if you wanna chat it out. 💛"}
{"query": "I got asked out and I don’t like them that way.", "response": "Oh, I hear you! That can be such a tricky situation to navigate. The key is to be kind and honest without leading them on. If you’re comfortable, you can simply say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I really appreciate you asking, but I don't feel the same way romantically. I really value our connection, though, and I hope we can keep things cool.\"\n\nIt’s totally okay to set boundaries—it’s much kinder to be upfront than to leave them wondering or hoping for something that isn’t there. Just be calm and kind about it. You’ve got this! 💛"}
{"query": "I like two people at the same time and I feel guilty.", "response": "Hey, that’s a totally normal feeling—so don’t be too hard on yourself. Crushes and feelings can get complicated, especially when more than one person is involved. But liking two people at the same time doesn’t make you a bad person, nor does it mean you’re doing anything wrong! Emotions aren’t always simple, and you’re allowed to feel things as they come.\n\nGuilt often happens when you feel as though you need to “choose” or prioritize one person, or that you’re hurting someone even though you haven’t intentionally done anything. Maybe start by giving yourself some time to figure out what you’re feeling—what is it you like about each person, and how do these feelings align with what *you* want in a relationship? It’s okay to take things slow and reflect before making any decisions or sharing your feelings.\n\nJust be kind to yourself as you sort it out. Relationships can be tricky, but they also offer a lot of room for growth and learning about yourself."}
{"query": "My parent read my diary/notes and I feel so violated.", "response": "Oh no, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. That sounds incredibly frustrating and hurtful, especially when something as personal as your diary gets invaded like that. Your diary is supposed to be *your* safe space, where you can express yourself freely without judgment or fear of being seen. Having that violated can feel like such a breach of trust.\n\nHow are you feeling right now? Have you had a chance to talk to your parent about it? I know it’s tricky, but sometimes letting them know how this made you feel might help rebuild some boundaries or understanding. If you’re comfortable sharing, we can brainstorm together on how you could handle this situation."}
{"query": "I feel like I’m doing my best and it’s still not enough.", "response": "I hear you. That’s such a tough feeling, and I want to remind you that it’s okay to feel this way—it doesn’t mean you’re failing. Life can throw so many things at us all at once, and it can be overwhelming, no matter how hard we try. \n\nBut here’s the thing: Your best *is* enough. No one’s best will ever be perfect, and that’s okay; we’re not meant to have it all together all the time. So maybe take some time to pause and acknowledge all the effort you’re putting in—it’s huge. You’re doing more than you give yourself credit for.\n\nAlso, be kind to yourself. Sometimes, when you feel like what you’re doing isn't enough, it might be because expectations (yours or someone else’s) have crept up higher than is actually reasonable. Your well-being matters too, so don’t forget to check in and make sure you’re not pushing yourself more than you should.\n\nYou’re not alone in feeling this way, and I promise you, there’s light up ahead—even if it’s hard to see right now. Keep taking it day by day, okay? You're doing amazing simply by showing up and trying."}
