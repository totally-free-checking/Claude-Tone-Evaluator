Here are a few quick options, depending on your teacher:\n\n1. **Just be honest** — “I completely forgot to bring it. Can I turn it in tomorrow?” Most teachers appreciate honesty over a wild excuse.\n2. **If it’s digital**, say you’ll email it as soon as you get home.\n3. **If it’s partly done**, tell them you’re still polishing it and ask if you can hand it in later today or first thing tomorrow.\n\nWant help making it sound genuine, or figuring out what to say?"}
{"query": "I got seated next to someone I used to be friends with and it’s so awkward.", "response": "Totally get that. That can feel super uncomfortable, especially when you're kind of stuck there for a while.\n\n**If you want to break the ice (low-pressure options):**\n- A simple, warm smile and a \"Hey, how've you been?\" goes a long way.\n- A light comment about the situation: \"Well, this is a bit of a surprise! Small world.\"\n- A neutral, positive observation: \"This is a great event/place, isn't it?\"\n\n**If you'd rather keep it chill/no conversation:**\n- It's perfectly okay to just give a polite nod or a brief \"hi\" and then focus on your phone, the speaker, your food, etc.\n- You don't owe anyone a long chat. Acknowledging them and then respectfully disengaging is a valid choice.\n\n**Remember:** The awkwardness is probably mutual. Just being kind and civil, whether you chat or not, is enough. You got this!"}
{"query": "My best friend is being super dry over text and won’t tell me why.", "response": "That can be really frustrating and a bit worrisome. It might feel like you’re being shut out for no clear reason. A few possibilities come to mind:\n\n- Something might be going on with them that they’re not ready to talk about.\n- They could be going through a busy, distracted, or low-energy period.\n- It might not be about you at all, but they’re not communicating that well.\n\nSometimes the best approach is to give a little space while leaving the door open. You could try saying something like:\n\n> \"Hey, I've noticed things feel a bit different lately. I'm here for you if you want to talk — no pressure, just letting you know.\"\n\nIf you've already reached out like that, it might just be a waiting game, which can be hard. Hang in there."}
{"query": "Someone started a rumor about me and I don’t know how to shut it down.", "response": "That’s tough, and it’s completely normal to feel upset or stressed when that happens. Rumors can really hurt, and it's hard to know what to do. Here are some steps you could take—depending on the situation—to try and shut it down or minimize its impact:\n\n1. **Stay calm and don't react emotionally in public.** People spreading rumors often want a reaction—don’t give them the satisfaction. Take some time to breathe and think before responding.\n2. **Consider the source and reach.** Is it a small group, or has it spread widely? Sometimes ignoring a low-stakes rumor is the best approach, especially if it’s likely to blow over quickly.\n3. **Correct it calmly if you need to.** If it’s affecting your reputation, relationships, or mental health, you can calmly and simply state the truth—without drama. Stick to facts and don’t get defensive.\n4. **Reach out to people you trust.** Talk to close friends or someone you feel safe with. They can support you and even help shut down the rumor by correcting misinformation when they hear it.\n5. **Avoid fueling it.** Don’t confront the rumormonger publicly if it might escalate things. Sometimes private conversations can help (if you think the person will listen), but if they’re not acting in good faith, it might be better to distance yourself.\n6. **Focus on being yourself.** Continue being kind, trustworthy, and engaged in your usual activities. Your consistent actions over time can speak louder than rumors.\n7. **Seek help if it becomes harassment.** If the rumor is malicious, persistent, or impacting your safety/well-being, talk to someone in authority you trust (like a teacher, HR, or supervisor). Documenting what’s happening can also help.\n\nRemember: you can’t control what others say, but you can control how you respond. It’s easier said than done, but focusing on the people who know and respect you for who you are is key.\n\nIs there anything specific about the rumor or situation that you’d like advice on?"}

It doesn’t define your abilities or how much you’ve learned. Sometimes the pressure gets to us or we just have an off day.  \n\nIf you’re up for it, maybe think about what tripped you up and see if there’s a way to review it for the future. And if it helps, talk to your teacher—they might let you retake it or give you extra credit opportunities.\n\nFor now, do something to relax—watch something funny, go for a walk, or grab a snack.

{"query": "My group project partner hasn’t done anything and it’s due tomorrow.", "response": "Ugh, that’s the worst feeling. Sorry you're dealing with this — group projects can be super stressful, especially when someone doesn’t pull their weight. Here’s what you can do right now:\n\n### 1. **Contact them — one last time**\nSend a clear, direct message (text, email, whatever they actually check).  \nExample: *\"Hey, the project is due tomorrow and your part isn’t done yet. I need it by [specific time today] so I can put everything together. Let me know if you can't do it, so I can adjust.\"*  \nThis puts the ball in their court and sets a hard deadline *before* the actual due date.\n\n### 2. **Talk to your instructor ASAP**\nIf they don’t respond or still don’t contribute, let your teacher/professor know. Email them tonight or talk to them before class tomorrow.  \nBe factual, not overly emotional:  \n- “My partner hasn’t contributed their portion despite reminders.”  \n- “Here’s what I’ve completed so far.”  \n- “What do you recommend?”  \nThis documents the issue *before* submission so it doesn’t look like an excuse after a bad grade.\n\n### 3. **Do what you can on your own (if possible)**\nIf there’s time, try to cover the essentials of their part just so the project is complete. Even if it’s not perfect, it’s better than a blank section.  \n**But** — don’t kill yourself doing their entire job. Focus on making your own work shine and note what wasn’t done by them.\n\n### 4. **After submitting, talk about grading**\nAsk your instructor if grading can be individual or weighted based on contribution. Some teachers allow that if there’s clear evidence of unequal work.\n\n### 5. **For the future**\n- Set clear roles and deadlines *early* in the project.\n- Use shared docs (Google Docs, Trello, etc.) where you can see edits in real time.\n- Loop in the instructor early if someone ghosts — don’t wait until the due date.\n\nYou’re not alone — this happens a lot. Do what you can to protect your grade and your sanity. Good luck! 🍀"}

It can feel really uncomfortable when privacy is crossed, and their reaction probably adds to that feeling.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons why they might be acting differently:\n\n1. **They saw something unexpected** — maybe something surprised them, and they’re still processing it.\n2. **They don’t know how to talk about it** — they might feel awkward or unsure how to bring it up without making things tense.\n3. **They’re worried** — maybe they saw something that made them concerned for you (whether you feel it’s justified or not).\n4. **They feel guilty** — if they know they overstepped, they could be acting “weird” because they feel uncomfortable about it.\n\nIf you feel up to it, you could try opening the conversation gently by saying something like:\n\n> “Hey, I’ve noticed things have felt kind of off lately.

Do it a couple of times — it can reduce tension.\n\n- **Hold something**: If you can, hold a pen, your notes, or even touch the podium lightly. It can make the shaking less noticeable.\n\n- **Power pose**: Try standing tall, shoulders back, hands on hips for a moment before you start.

{"query": "Someone took a picture of me without asking and posted it.", "response": "That’s a really uncomfortable situation — I’m sorry that happened. It’s normal to feel upset or even violated when someone posts a photo of you without your permission, especially if they didn’t ask first.\n\nHere are some steps you could consider, depending on your comfort level and the context:\n\n### 1. **Assess the situation**\n- Where was the photo posted? (Social media, a group chat, a public website?)\n- Who posted it? (A friend, a stranger, someone at an event?)\n- Is the photo inappropriate, embarrassing, or being used in a harmful way?\n\n### 2. **Reach out privately**\nIf you know the person who posted it, you could message them calmly and ask them to take it down. Sometimes people don’t realize it might bother you. A simple message like:\n> “Hey, I saw you posted a photo of me. I’d appreciate it if you could take it down since I wasn’t asked beforehand.”\n\n### 3. **Report the photo**\nIf it’s on social media (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), most platforms allow you to report photos that violate your privacy. Look for the “report” option on the post.\n\n### 4. **Consider the legal side**\nDepending on where you live, posting someone’s photo without consent — especially in a private setting or for harmful purposes — may violate privacy or harassment laws. If the photo is being used maliciously or you feel unsafe, you may want to look into your local laws or speak to someone you trust about possible legal steps.\n\n### 5. **Take care of yourself**\nEven if the photo seems harmless to others, your feelings about it are valid. Talk to someone you trust if it’s bothering you, and don’t feel pressured to just “brush it off” if it doesn’t feel right to you.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing more details (like where it was posted or your relationship to the person), I can try to give more tailored suggestions.

It’s okay to feel hurt.**  \nYour feelings are valid. It’s natural to feel embarrassed, frustrated, or even angry when someone in authority criticizes you publicly. Don’t brush it off like it’s nothing if it’s bothering you.\n\n**2. Try to separate the message from the delivery.**  \nSometimes coaches push hard to motivate athletes, and they may not realize how their tone or setting affects you. Ask yourself: Was there something useful in what they said, even if the way it was delivered felt harsh?\n\n**3. Consider talking to your coach privately later.**  \nIf you feel comfortable, you could approach them one-on-one and say something like:  \n> “Hey Coach, I wanted to talk about what happened earlier. I’m committed to improving, and I take feedback seriously, but being corrected in front of the team was really embarrassing for me. Could we maybe talk one-on-one in the future if there’s something I need to work on?”\n\nA good coach will respect that and might even apologize or explain their perspective.\n\n**4. Remember everyone makes mistakes — even coaches.**  \nYour coach might have been having a bad day or might not have realized the impact of their actions. This moment doesn’t define you as an athlete or a person.\n\n**5. Reach out to a teammate or friend.**  \nSometimes venting to someone who was there (or who knows your coach) can help you feel less alone. They might relate or offer support.\n\n---\n\nHow are you feeling about it now? Do you think you’d want to talk to your coach or just let it go for now?"}

{"query": "I’m pretty sure someone is mad at me but they won’t say why.", "response": "Ah, that’s a really uncomfortable feeling — being in the dark about someone’s frustration can leave you walking on eggshells. \n\nA few things you could consider:\n\n- **Give them space, but not too much.** Sometimes people need time to cool down before they can talk. If you push too hard right away, they might shut down more.\n\n- **Find a calm moment** to gently ask something like: “Hey, I’ve been getting the vibe that you’re upset with me — if I’ve done something to bother you, I’d really like to know so I can make it right.”\n\n- **Reflect on recent interactions** — was there a disagreement, a missed commitment, or maybe a misunderstanding? Sometimes it helps to think about timing or context clues.\n\n- **Prepare yourself to listen** if they do open up. Avoid getting defensive — just hear them out.\n\nIt’s also possible they’re dealing with something completely unrelated and it’s spilling over. But it’s mature of you to notice and care enough to want to resolve it.\n\nWant to talk about how you could bring it up, or how it’s affecting you?"}
{"query": "My teacher moved my seat away from my friends and I’m mad.", "response": "It totally makes sense that you're mad — being moved away from your friends in class can feel really unfair and isolating. Maybe your teacher noticed side conversations or wanted to shake up seating for focus, but it still stinks when it happens to you.\n\nSometimes teachers try different things to help everyone learn better, but they don't always realize how it affects friendships or how you feel. If you feel comfortable, you could try talking to your teacher after class — maybe ask if there's a specific reason for the change, and share that you’re worried about staying focused and connected without disrupting. Teachers sometimes listen if you approach them calmly.\n\nIn the meantime, maybe you can plan to catch up with your friends between classes, at lunch, or after school. And even though it’s tough, sometimes sitting with new people can lead to unexpected friendships.\n\nHang in there. I hope things get better soon! 💙"}

It can sound dismissive, as if your feelings are an overreaction rather than a valid response.\n\nWhat's especially frustrating is that it often shifts the focus from the actual issue to your emotional state. You might feel like you're being told to *manage your emotions for someone else's comfort* instead of being heard.\n\n**What sometimes helps in the moment:**\n*   Take a breath (for you, not for them). A quick, intentional pause can short-circuit the spiral.\n*   You could say something like, *\"I'll calm down when we address the problem. Right now, I need to be heard.\"*\n*   Or simply: *\"Telling me to calm down isn't helping.

Here are a few steps that might help:\n\n### 1. **Check Requirements**\n- Look up your school’s graduation requirements — what do you *have* to take?\n- What prerequisites do you need for future classes, college, or a possible career interest?\n\n### 2. **Think About Balance**\n- Mix challenging classes with ones you know you’ll enjoy.\n- Avoid overloading yourself — consider your other commitments (work, sports, etc.).\n\n### 3. **Ask Around**\n- Talk to teachers, older students, or your school counselor.\n- They can give you insight into workload, teaching styles, and what might be a good fit.\n\n### 4. **Consider Your Goals**\n- Do you have a college major in mind? Check if certain courses are recommended.\n- Even if you don’t, choose classes that sound interesting — sometimes passion leads to unexpected paths.\n\n### 5. **Make a Draft Schedule**\n- Write down a few possible schedules — sometimes seeing it on paper makes it clearer.\n- Check for potential conflicts.\n\nWant to talk it through?

{"query": "My parents want my grades to be perfect and it’s stressing me out.", "response": "Hey, I’m really sorry you’re dealing with that. It sounds incredibly stressful and frustrating when it feels like the pressure is constant and the expectations are sky-high. You’re not alone in feeling this way—a lot of students experience pressure from their parents, even when it comes from a place of care.\n\nIt’s natural for parents to want the best for you, but sometimes they might not realize how much weight their expectations are putting on you. You’re a person, not just a report card, and your worth isn’t tied to a perfect score.\n\nIf you feel safe doing so, would it help to have a calm conversation with them? You could try explaining how you feel—let them know you’re doing your best, but that the pressure is making it harder to focus and feel motivated. Sometimes parents don’t realize the emotional toll until it’s brought to their attention.\n\nIn the meantime, make sure you’re taking care of yourself. Take breaks, get enough sleep, and try to find small ways to relax when things feel overwhelming. And remember—perfection is an impossible standard. It’s okay to strive for your best, but “your best” doesn’t have to be perfect.\n\nYou’ve got this. And even if your grades aren’t flawless, you’re still valuable, still capable, and still worthy of love and support. 💛"}
{"query": "Someone keeps texting me nonstop and I don’t know how to set a boundary.", "response": "Ah, that’s frustrating — it can feel overwhelming when someone’s messages start to feel constant. Setting a boundary can be tricky, but it’s totally okay (and healthy) to create some space for yourself.\n\nHere are a few ideas you could try, depending on how direct you’re comfortable being:\n\n---\n\n**Option 1 — Simple and Direct (but kind)**\n> “Hey, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with notifications lately and I’m trying to be more present offline. I might be slower to reply from now on — just so you know!”\n\n---\n\n**Option 2 — If you want to suggest check-ins instead**\n> “I love catching up, but sometimes it’s hard to keep up with constant messages. Would it work for you if we checked in once a day/week instead?”\n\n---\n\n**Option 3 — Gradual pull-back (less direct)**\n- Start taking longer to reply (an hour, then a few hours, then a day).\n- Keep your replies warm but brief.\n- Avoid opening messages when you don’t have the energy to respond — they might take the hint over time.\n\n---\n\n**Option 4 — If it’s someone who doesn’t take hints**\nYou might need to be a bit firmer:\n> “I need to let you know that getting a lot of texts throughout the day makes it hard for me to focus. I’d appreciate it if we could slow down the messaging a bit.”\n\n---\n\nRemember:\n- You don’t need to apologize for needing space.\n- It’s okay if they’re temporarily disappointed — your peace matters.\n- If they ignore your request, you can mute notifications or limit your availability further.\n\nHow does the situation feel to you? Are they a close friend, someone you’re dating, or more of an acquaintance? That might help decide the best approach."}

{"query": "My friend borrowed my stuff and returned it ruined.", "response": "That’s really frustrating — I’m sorry that happened. Here are a few thoughts on how you could handle it:\n\n1. **Talk to them calmly** — Let them know how you feel without blaming. Something like, “Hey, I was really disappointed to see my [item] came back damaged. What happened?”\n2. **Ask for a resolution** — Depending on the item and the extent of the damage, you could ask if they’re willing to replace it, repair it, or help cover the cost.\n3. **Consider the friendship** — Think about whether it was an accident or if it’s a pattern. Good friends usually try to make things right.\n4. **Set future boundaries** — If you decide to lend things again, maybe mention that you’d appreciate more care, or think twice before lending something really valuable or delicate.\n\nIt’s tough when something like this strains a friendship. Do you feel like they would be open to talking about it?"}
{"query": "I think my friend is lying to me and I don’t know how to ask.", "response": "That’s a tough spot to be in — it can feel really unsettling when you’re not sure whether someone you care about is being honest with you. It's completely normal to feel confused or hurt by this.\n\nBefore jumping into a conversation, it might help to ask yourself a few things:\n- **Why do you suspect they’re lying?** Are there specific things they said that don’t add up, or is it more of a gut feeling?\n- **How important is this issue?** Is it something small that might not be worth confronting, or is it affecting your trust in them significantly?\n- **What’s your relationship like with this friend?** Is there generally trust and openness, or has there been tension before?\n\nIf you decide to talk to them, here are some gentle ways to approach it:\n\n1. **Start from a place of curiosity, not accusation.**  \n   Instead of saying, “You lied to me,” you could say something like, “Hey, I’m a little confused about what you mentioned the other day — can you help me understand?”\n\n2. **Use “I” statements.**  \n   For example: “I feel uneasy because I heard something different, and I just want to make sure we’re on the same page.”\n\n3. **Give them space to explain.**  \n   Sometimes people bend the truth because they’re embarrassed, scared, or trying to avoid conflict. Giving them a chance to clarify without judgment can encourage honesty.\n\n4. **Be prepared for different outcomes.**  \n   They might come clean, get defensive, or not give a clear answer. Think about what you’d need from them afterward to rebuild trust, or if this changes the friendship for you.\n\nYou don’t have to have this conversation right away — it’s okay to take time to sort out your feelings. And remember, trusting your intuition is important, but it’s also okay to give people the benefit of the doubt if it feels right.\n\nHow are you feeling about all of this?

{"query": "I feel like my friends only talk to me when they need something.", "response": "That’s a really tough feeling to navigate — and you’re definitely not alone in experiencing it. It can make friendships feel one-sided and leave you wondering where you stand.\n\nIf it feels safe and right for you, here are a few ways you might want to approach it:\n\n- **Try initiating contact for no reason at all** — sometimes, people get used to patterns in friendships. Reaching out just to check in or share something small can shift the dynamic.\n- **Notice if it’s a pattern with certain people or everyone** — it might be worth asking yourself if this is one friend or a few, or if you’re noticing it across the board.\n- **When you’re comfortable, mention how you feel** — maybe in a light way like, “Hey, I love helping out, but sometimes I miss just chatting about random stuff.” This can open up the conversation without sounding accusatory.\n- **Consider your own boundaries** — if you notice you’re often giving more than you’re receiving, it’s okay to step back a little and focus on relationships that feel more reciprocal.\n- **Reflect on what you want from these friendships** — do you want deeper connection, more casual hangouts, or maybe to meet new people who share your communication style?\n\nYou deserve friendships that make you feel valued — not just useful.

{"query": "My parents won’t let me go out and everyone else can.", "response": "Hey, I’m really sorry to hear that. Feeling left out when it seems like other people your age are allowed to do things can be really frustrating and isolating.\n\nIt might help to have a calm conversation with your parents to understand their reasons. Sometimes parents have concerns about safety, their own past experiences, or specific rules they believe are important. If you listen to their side, it could help you find a compromise—maybe starting with shorter outings, going out with a trusted friend, or checking in more often.\n\nIn the meantime, are there things you can do at home or nearby that still feel fun or social? Maybe inviting a friend over, joining an online group with shared interests, or planning something special for when you do get to go out?\n\nHang in there—parent rules can feel tough, but they often loosen up with time and trust."}

Constantly being measured against someone else, especially a sibling, can be exhausting, hurtful, and can even make you question your own path.\n\nWant to talk about it? Like, who’s doing the comparing, or what it is they’re saying? Sometimes just naming it helps take some of its power away.\n\nIf you’d rather not go into details, that’s totally fine too. But just so you know—your worth isn’t a ranking system. You have your own strengths, your own timeline, and your own story that’s entirely separate from anyone else’s.

{"query": "My crush smiled at me and now I’m overthinking everything.", "response": "Oh man, I totally get that feeling—it’s like your brain suddenly shifts into “analyze every single micro-expression” mode! 😄\n\nFirst off, take a breath.

But don’t let your brain spiral into \"what if\" territory just yet.\n\nInstead, try this:\n\n1. **Take it at face value for now.** Enjoy the moment—you made someone smile! That’s nice in itself.\n2. **Look for consistency.** If you notice more smiles, eye contact, or little interactions over time, that’s a positive sign.\n3. **Respond naturally.** Next time you see them, smile back! Maybe even say hi or give a small compliment—nothing over the top, just friendly.\n4. **Don’t let it freeze you.** It’s easy to overthink and then act awkward later. Remember: they’re just a person, you’re just a person. A relaxed you is your best self.\n\nAnything in particular about the interaction that’s got you replaying it?

It’s one of those quiet kinds of hurt that can make you question your own worth, even though the problem isn't about you.\n\nI think a lot of people have felt that \"backup\" feeling at some point. It’s that sense that you’re only thought of when other plans fall through, or when the \"main\" friend isn’t around. You might notice patterns, like:\n\n*   Last-minute invites only.\n*   Conversations that feel one-sided.\n*   Cancellations that happen a lot, often for vague reasons.\n*   Feeling like an audience to their life rather than a part of it.\n\nIt hurts because friendship, at its core, is about mutual care and chosen presence. Feeling like a second choice contradicts that entirely.\n\nWhat you do with this feeling is up to you, but here are a couple of ways people often handle it:\n\n**1. Gently re-calibrate your energy.** You could start matching the level of effort they give. Invest a little less emotionally and with your time, and redirect that energy toward other connections or activities that fill you up. Sometimes friendships naturally find a different, more sustainable level.\n\n**2. Have a direct, low-key chat (if you think the friendship is worth saving).** You don't have to accuse them of making you a backup. You could say something like, *\"Hey, I've been feeling a bit disconnected lately and miss hanging out. Would you be up for making plans more regularly?\"* Their response (and follow-through) will tell you everything.\n\n**3. Focus on being your own \"main character.\"** This is the most important one. The most secure friendships are built when both people feel whole on their own. Dive into your own interests, passions, and goals. The people who are genuinely drawn to *you* will want to be part of that journey.\n\nIt's okay to grieve the friendship you thought you had or hoped it would be. Your feelings are completely valid. Sometimes these moments, as painful as they are, help us make room for the connections that are truly reciprocal—the ones where you’re not an option, but a priority."}

For example:\n- Is this a recent change, or has it been happening for a while?\n- Do they usually give a reason, or just cancel without much explanation?\n- How does it make you feel when it happens?\n\nSometimes there’s an underlying reason—they might be struggling with anxiety, overwhelm, or something else in their life. Other times, it might be a sign of mismatched expectations about your friendship.\n\nOnce you figure out the possible \"why,\" you can decide how to talk to them about it in a way that’s honest but kind."}
{"query": "Someone keeps making comments about my body and I hate it.", "response": "I’m really sorry you’re dealing with that. It’s not okay for someone to make comments about your body, especially when it makes you uncomfortable. You deserve to feel safe and respected.\n\nIf you feel up to it, here are a few things you could consider:\n\n1. **Set a clear boundary** — You can tell them calmly but firmly something like:  \n   *“I don’t appreciate comments about my body. Please stop.”*  \n   You don’t need to justify or explain — your discomfort is enough.\n\n2. **Limit contact if possible** — If this person continues despite you asking them to stop, it might be worth distancing yourself from them when you can.\n\n3. **Talk to someone you trust** — Sometimes sharing what you’re going through with a friend, family member, or counselor can help you feel supported and less alone.\n\n4. **Consider reporting if it’s harassment** — If the comments are persistent, inappropriate, and happening in a space like work, school, or online, there may be policies in place to address harassment.\n\nNo one has the right to make you feel uncomfortable in your own skin. Your feelings are completely valid. 💙"}

Just listen, without trying to fix everything.**  \nSometimes people just need to be heard. You could say something like:  \n“Thanks for trusting me with this. I’m here for you, whatever you need.”\n\n**2. Ask how they’d like to be supported.**  \nIt’s okay not to assume — try asking gently:  \n“Do you need someone to vent to, or would you prefer some help figuring things out?”\n\n**3. Offer low-pressure company.**  \nSometimes sitting in silence together, sharing a meal, or going for a walk can be comforting.  \n“Want to grab coffee or go for a walk sometime soon? No pressure, just if you’d like to.”\n\n**4. Check in lightly and consistently.**  \nA simple text like,  \n“Thinking of you 💙”  \ncan remind them they’re not alone.\n\n**5.

You don’t have to share everything at once.\n- Write down what you want to say beforehand if that makes it easier.\n- It’s okay if you feel emotional or don’t have all the words — they’re trained to help guide the conversation.\n\nIs there something specific making you nervous about it?

{"query": "My friend’s parents don’t like me and it’s awkward.", "response": "Ah, that’s a tough spot to be in. Feeling like your friend’s parents aren’t on your side can definitely add stress to a friendship.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. **It’s often not about you personally.** Sometimes parents are protective, have different values, or are reacting to something unrelated — maybe something about your friend’s behavior that they’re associating with you, even if it’s not your fault.\n\n2. **Stay respectful and be yourself.** You don’t have to try too hard to win them over, but being polite, genuine, and respectful goes a long way. Over time, they may warm up when they see you’re a good influence or a true friend to their child.\n\n3. **Talk to your friend.** Depending on how close you are, you could gently ask if they’ve noticed the tension or if there’s something specific bothering their parents. They might have insight — or maybe they can help ease things on their end.\n\n4. **Give it time (and space).** If it’s possible, try not to take every interaction to heart. Sometimes relationships with parents evolve slowly, especially if they don’t know you well yet.\n\nIs this a recent thing, or has it been going on for a while?

If it’s something like a phone or keys, consider using a tracking feature if available.\n\n**If it’s truly urgent** (like medication, wallet, or ID), tell a teacher or office staff *today* — they can help make announcements or check security cameras if needed.\n\nAnd remember — most lost things do turn up.

Here are a few gentle, low-drama ways to handle it:\n\n### 1. **Politely change the subject**\nIf they start gossiping, you can shift focus naturally. For example:\n- “Oh, by the way, have you seen that new show on Netflix?”\n- “Speaking of that, it reminds me of [something positive/neutral].”\n- “I’d rather not talk about other people—how have *you* been doing lately?”\n\n### 2. **Neutral or non-committal responses**\nSometimes a simple “Hmm, I don’t know” or “I try not to get into others’ business” can signal your discomfort without confrontation.\n\n### 3. **Kindly set a boundary**\nIf it’s a pattern, you could say something honest but gentle, like:\n- “I always feel a bit off talking about people when they aren’t here to explain their side.”\n- “Honestly, I’m trying to focus on more positive conversations these days—it helps my own peace of mind.”\n\n### 4. **Redirect to empathy**\nYou can gently nudge the conversation toward compassion:\n- “That sounds tough for them. Maybe they were having a bad day.”\n- “It’s hard to know what someone’s really going through, right?”\n\n### 5. **Lead by example**\nShare stories or updates that are positive, focused on ideas, events, or your own experiences (without putting others down). Sometimes people mirror the tone we set.\n\n### 6. **If needed, have a private chat**\nIf you value the friendship and the gossip feels toxic, you might say later:\n- “Hey, I really value our friendship, but I’ve realized gossip brings my energy down. Could we try to keep things more positive when we chat?”\n\nRemember, how they respond may tell you a lot about the friendship. A true friend will respect your feelings, even if it takes them a little time to adjust.\n\nYou’ve got this—handling it with kindness shows a lot of integrity."}
{"query": "I’m getting stressed for no reason and I can’t shut my brain off.", "response": "Hey, that’s a tough spot to be in — I totally get that. It’s like your thoughts are on a hamster wheel and won’t slow down, even when there’s no clear “reason” for it.\n\nHere are a few gentle, doable things that might help:\n\n1. **Breathe with your body** – Put one hand on your chest, one on your belly. Take a slow breath in through your nose, let your belly rise first, then chest. Exhale slowly through your mouth. Even just 3 breaths like this can dial down the noise a little.\n\n2. **Move a little** – Shake out your arms, stretch, walk around the room, or dance to one song. Sometimes physical movement helps shift mental stuckness.\n\n3. **Ground yourself** – Look around and name:\n   - 5 things you can see\n   - 4 things you can feel (feet on the floor, shirt fabric, etc.)\n   - 3 things you can hear\n   - 2 things you can smell or like the smell of\n   - 1 thing you can taste\n\n4. **Write it out** – Grab a notes app or a piece of paper and just brain-dump everything swirling in your head. No order, no judgment. Sometimes getting it out of your head makes it feel less crowded.\n\n5. **Distract kindly** – Sometimes stepping away helps. Listen to a podcast, watch a comforting show, doodle, or do a simple task like organizing a drawer.\n\nStress doesn’t always need a “reason”—sometimes it’s just how our body and brain respond to being tired, overstimulated, or just…human.\n\nBe gentle with yourself. You’re not failing at calming down — you’re noticing something, and that’s the first step.\n\nWant to talk about anything that’s on your mind or try another idea?"}
{"query": "My parents want to talk about college and I’m only in like… tenth grade.", "response": "Yeah, that can feel pretty overwhelming. It’s super normal for them to start thinking about it in tenth grade though — even if it feels early to you.  \n\nYou could start by just asking what’s on their mind. Something like, “Hey, are you thinking about college costs, or just wanting to make sure I’m on track? Let’s talk about it so we’re on the same page.”\n\nMaybe they just want to know what *you’re* interested in — or maybe they’re worried about saving money and deadlines. Getting it out in the open will help you all get ahead without it turning into a pressure-fest."}
{"query": "I think my teacher hates me and I don’t know why.", "response": "Hey, I'm really sorry you're going through that — feeling like a teacher dislikes you can be really stressful, especially when you don't know why.  \nYou’re definitely not alone in feeling this way. Sometimes our brains jump to the worst-case scenario when we notice something off, but there could be a lot of things going on that aren't about you personally.\n\nA few thoughts that might help:\n\n1. **Teachers are human too** — they have bad days, they get stressed, and sometimes they might seem short or distant without it having anything to do with you personally. Maybe something in their personal life is affecting their mood.\n  \n2. **Could it be a misunderstanding?** Maybe they’ve given you feedback that felt harsh, or maybe you’ve had an interaction that felt awkward. Sometimes tone or intention can be misinterpreted, especially in a classroom setting.\n\n3. **Have you noticed a pattern?** Is it something specific they say or do? Do they treat you differently from other students? Sometimes what feels like dislike might actually be them challenging you because they think you can do better — it doesn’t always come across well, though.\n\n4. **Would you feel comfortable talking to them?** Sometimes a simple check-in can clear the air. You could say something like, *“I’ve been feeling a bit unsure about my standing in your class lately. Is there anything I can do to improve?”* This shows you care and gives them a chance to clarify.\n\n5. **Consider talking to a school counselor or another teacher you trust** — they might have insight or be able to help you figure out the best way to handle the situation.\n\nRemember: your worth isn’t defined by how one person treats you. If it turns out there really is an issue, know that it’s not a reflection of who you are as a person or student.\n\nWant to talk more about what’s been happening? Sometimes just getting it all out can help."}
{"query": "Someone keeps teasing me and I can’t tell if it’s bullying.", "response": "That’s a tough spot to be in — it can feel confusing and frustrating when you're not sure if someone is just joking around or crossing a line into bullying. \n\nHere are a few things to consider that might help you figure it out:\n\n1. **How it makes you feel** — If the teasing makes you feel small, embarrassed, angry, anxious, or unsafe regularly, that’s a sign it’s not just playful.\n2. **Balance of power** — Does the person have more social power (like being more popular, older, or in a position of authority)? Is it one-sided, or does it feel like you can joke back and it’s mutual?\n3. **Intent vs. impact** — Even if they say “I’m just joking,” if the impact on you is hurtful, that matters. Real friends will stop or tone it down if you tell them it bothers you.\n4. **Pattern vs. one-off** — Is this happening repeatedly over time? Occasional teasing between friends can be normal, but if it’s frequent and targeted, that leans toward bullying.\n5. **Your comfort level** — Do you feel like you have to laugh along or hide how you feel? You have a right to set boundaries.\n\nIf you decide it’s bullying (or even if you’re just uncomfortable), here are some steps you could take:\n- **Tell them how it makes you feel** — Use “I” statements like, “I feel hurt when you say that, even if you don’t mean it that way.”\n- **Talk to someone you trust** — A friend, family member, teacher, or counselor can give you support and perspective.\n- **Distance yourself if needed** — You don’t have to stick around someone who dismisses your feelings.\n\nRemember: your feelings are valid, and you deserve respect. Trust your gut — if something feels off, it probably is. Want to talk more about the situation?"}
{"query": "My friend got mad because I hung out with someone else.", "response": "Ah, that can feel pretty tricky. Friends sometimes have unspoken expectations, especially when it comes to time and attention.\n\nDo you want to talk about what happened? Sometimes hearing the situation can help figure out if it's a misunderstanding, a boundary that got crossed, or if your friend is maybe feeling a bit insecure or left out. No pressure, just here if you want to unpack it."}
{"query": "I’m scared I’m going to fail this class.", "response": "Hey, it’s totally okay to feel scared. A lot of people have been there, especially with a tough class or a heavy workload. Want to talk about what’s making you feel this way? \n\nSometimes just naming what’s going on — like a big exam coming up, trouble with certain topics, or feeling overwhelmed — can help break it down into something more manageable.\n\nI’m here to listen. No judgment, just support."}
{"query": "I have to do a partner dance in PE and I want to die of embarrassment.", "response": "Aw, I totally get that feeling — partner dances in PE can feel super awkward at first, especially if you're not used to dancing in front of people. The thing is, almost everyone else is probably feeling a little self-conscious too, even if they don't show it.\n\nA few quick thoughts that might help:\n- Treat it like a fun goof instead of a serious performance — if you smile and laugh a little at yourself, it can lighten the mood.\n- Focus on your partner and the steps, not the people watching.\n- It’s usually just for a short time, and then you’ll be done with it.\n\nIf you're really uncomfortable, you could even talk to your PE teacher privately — sometimes they’re understanding if you’re truly anxious about it.\n\nYou got this 💪 — and who knows, maybe you’ll end up having more fun than you expect. Want any tips on basic dance steps or how to keep it low-pressure?"}
{"query": "My friend keeps making everything a competition.", "response": "Yeah, that can be *exhausting* — like, you just want to share a win or vent a frustrating day, and suddenly you’re in the Olympics of everyday life.\n\nIt might come from a place of insecurity — they might feel they need to \"measure up\" or don’t know how to connect without comparing. Some people are just wired to be competitive, but it can leave others feeling like every conversation is a subtle contest.\n\nIf it’s weighing on you, you could try:\n- **Humor or deflection** — \"Wow, are we keeping score? Should I get a whiteboard?\" (said lightly)\n- **Acknowledge and pivot** — \"That's cool! Anyway, what I was saying was...\"\n- **Reframe it** — If they say, \"I worked out for TWO hours today,\" you could say, \"Nice, sounds like you had a really productive morning. I’m glad my 30-minute walk cleared my head too.\"\n- **Talk about it gently later** — If it’s a close friend, sometimes a low-pressure chat helps: \"Hey, sometimes when we talk, it feels a bit competitive — maybe we can just chill and celebrate each other without comparing?\"\n\nBut also — sometimes you just have to emotionally opt out. Not everything needs to be engaged with. You can quietly decide not to play the game and just let their comments hang without taking the bait. Your peace of mind matters, too."}
{"query": "My parents are being extra strict for no reason.", "response": "I get it, that can be really frustrating, especially when it feels like the rules are coming out of nowhere. Want to talk about what's going on? \n\nSometimes parents have reasons that aren't obvious at first—maybe they're worried about something or going through their own stress. Or maybe it does seem random, and you just need to figure out how to navigate it. \n\nWhat kind of strictness are you dealing with? Like curfews, rules about friends, school stuff, or something else?"}
{"query": "I got invited somewhere but I don’t know anyone else going.", "response": "Ah, that’s totally normal — everyone’s been there! It can feel a little nerve-wracking, but honestly, it’s also a great chance to meet new people. Want a few ideas to make it easier?"}
{"query": "I feel like everyone has a ‘thing’ and I don’t.", "response": "It’s super common to feel that way, honestly. A lot of people worry that they don’t have a standout “thing”—like a super niche hobby, an unusual talent, or a super clear passion that defines them. Sometimes we compare our “behind-the-scenes” to other people’s highlight reels, especially on social media.\n\nBut here’s something to consider:\n- Your “thing” doesn’t have to be extraordinary or Instagram-worthy. It might be the way you make people laugh, how you listen, your curiosity about random topics, or even just being a reliable friend.\n- Some people are generalists—good at lots of things, adaptable, and interested in many areas. That’s a “thing” in itself.\n- Your “thing” could also still be emerging. Sometimes we grow into our interests or discover what lights us up later on.\n\nWhat feels like a lack might just be that you haven’t labeled what makes you *you* yet. Maybe try exploring small things that bring you joy or curiosity without pressure to make them your identity. \n\nDid something specific make you think about this, or is it more a general feeling?"}
{"query": "My friend asked me to keep a secret that feels serious.", "response": "It sounds like you're carrying something heavy. If a secret is making you feel uncomfortable or worried, it's important to think about why. Sometimes secrets can involve someone’s safety or well-being—if that’s the case, it might be wise to talk to someone you trust, like a parent, counselor, or another responsible adult. Even if you promised to keep it, your own peace of mind matters too. How are you feeling about it?"}
{"query": "Someone I don’t like keeps trying to be friends with me.", "response": "It can be frustrating when someone’s efforts to connect don’t match your own feelings. It’s okay not to want a friendship with everyone — boundaries are important for your comfort and peace of mind.\n\nHere are a few things you might consider:\n\n1. **Be clear, but kind** – If they directly ask to hang out, you could say something like, \"I appreciate you reaching out, but I’m focusing on other priorities right now\" or \"I don’t think we have much in common, but I wish you the best.\"\n\n2. **Keep your responses minimal** – Sometimes being polite but distant (short replies, not making plans) can signal disinterest without confrontation.\n\n3. **Reflect on why it bothers you** – Is it their personality, past interactions, or maybe they’re coming on too strong? Understanding this can help you respond calmly.\n\n4. **Trust your feelings** – You don’t owe anyone your friendship. It’s healthy to prioritize people who make you feel comfortable.\n\nIf things get pushy or uncomfortable, don’t hesitate to distance yourself more firmly. If you’re in a situation where you have to interact with them (like work or school), staying neutral and keeping interactions brief can help keep things civil.\n\nDo you want to talk more about the specifics? Sometimes venting can help, too."}
{"query": "I’m nervous to eat in front of people at school.", "response": "Hey, it's totally normal to feel that way. A lot of people feel self-conscious about eating in front of others, especially in a busy place like school.\n\nA couple of things that might help:\n\n- Start small. Maybe eat with just one or two friends you feel comfortable around.\n- Choose foods that feel “safe” or easy to eat — things that aren’t too messy or loud.\n- If you can, sit in a slightly quieter corner or face away from crowds so you’re not feeling watched.\n- Remember, most people are focused on their own food or conversations — they’re not really paying attention to how you’re eating.\n\nIt’s okay to take your time and do what feels comfortable. You’ve got this."}
{"query": "I just got told ‘we need to talk’ and I’m terrified.", "response": "Totally understandable — that phrase can make anyone’s stomach drop. Try to take a deep breath first.\n\nIt doesn’t *always* mean something bad — sometimes it’s just the easiest way someone knows to start a serious or important conversation, even if it’s positive. But the uncertainty is the worst part.\n\nA few things you could do right now:\n\n1. **Don’t panic-spiral** — your mind might jump to worst-case scenarios, but wait until you have actual information.\n2. **Plan a response** if you want to ease the tension. You could reply with something like:  \n   *\"Sure, I'm available. Just so I can prepare, is there a particular topic you want to discuss?\"*  \n   That might help get a tiny bit of context.\n3. **Ground yourself** — take a walk, listen to music, text a friend. Distract yourself until the talk happens.\n\nYou’ve got this. Whatever it is, you’ll handle it once you know what “it” is. Hang in there. 💪"}
{"query": "My friend keeps sending me snaps at like 2am and I’m exhausted.", "response": "Totally get that — it’s frustrating to have your sleep interrupted. A few ideas that might help:\n\n- **Use Do Not Disturb:** If you don’t want to say anything, you can mute their notifications during your sleep hours. On Snapchat, you can go into their chat, tap their name or bitmoji, then choose settings to mute notifications, or set your phone to Do Not Disturb automatically each night.\n- **Send a casual heads-up:** If you feel comfortable, you could reply during the day with something like:  \n  *“Hey! I noticed you send snaps late at night sometimes — just FYI, I’m usually asleep by then so I’ll catch up with you in the morning.”*  \n  That way it’s light, friendly, and sets a boundary without making them feel bad.\n- **Reply later:** If you don’t want to address it directly, just open and reply to the snaps when you wake up. They might get the hint over time.\n\nGood sleep is important, so don’t feel bad about making a small adjustment here. 💤"}

I’ll let you know if anything important comes up!”\n\nSometimes they’re just curious or trying to connect. Other times, it might be their way of showing they care (even if it feels a little nosy).  \nIf you’re comfortable, you could even ask them why they ask — maybe it’ll open up a fun or helpful conversation.\n\nWhatever you choose, no pressure — you’ve got this! 💬✨"}
{"query": "I can’t tell if someone is flirting with me or just being nice.", "response": "That’s a classic human dilemma! The line between friendliness and flirting can be super fuzzy.  \nHere are a few cues to watch for—though there’s no 100% foolproof rule, because context, personality, and culture all play a part.\n\n**Possible flirting cues:**\n\n1. **Body language:**\n   - Leaning in toward you, especially if others are around but they’re focused on you.\n   - Eye contact that’s a little longer than normal, maybe with a smile.\n   - Mirroring your posture or gestures.\n   - Light, playful touches (e.g., on the arm during a laugh).\n\n2. **Conversation patterns:**\n   - They ask personal questions about your life, relationships, or interests.\n   - They find small reasons to compliment you (not just “nice shirt,” but maybe noticing something specific or personal).\n   - Teasing in a lighthearted way.\n   - They remember small details you mentioned in a past conversation.\n\n3. **Initiating contact:**\n   - They reach out first, often and seemingly without a “reason.”\n   - They suggest hanging out one-on-one, especially in a context that feels date-like (e.g., coffee, drinks, a walk).\n\n**Reasons it might just be friendliness:**\n\n- The person is naturally warm and outgoing with everyone.\n- They’re being polite in a professional or casual social setting.\n- Their compliments are generic or not very personal.\n- There’s little to no physical touch, and they keep conversation fairly surface-level.\n\n**What you can do if you’re unsure:**\n\n- **Observe consistency:** Do they act this way only with you, or with many people?\n- **Test the waters lightly:** Flirt back a little in a low-key way and see if they escalate or pull back. For example, give a warm compliment and watch their reaction.\n- **Ask a trusted friend:** Sometimes an outside perspective helps.\n- **When in doubt, just ask**—though you might wait until you have a stronger sense. You can say something like, “I really enjoy talking to you—would you ever want to grab a drink or coffee sometime?” to see if they interpret it as a friendly or romantic invitation.\n\nIt’s totally okay to misinterpret signals sometimes—it happens to almost everyone. Good luck!"}
{"query": "I got grounded and it feels unfair.", "response": "That’s always tough. Being grounded can feel really frustrating, especially if you don’t feel like it’s justified. \n\nWanna talk about what happened? Sometimes just putting it into words can help."}
{"query": "I’m stuck in a friend group where people are always arguing.", "response": "That sounds draining. It’s tough when a group you value feels like it’s always in conflict. Do you mean they’re arguing *with each other* or that there’s tension directed at you too?  \n\nSometimes people aren’t even aware of how constant disagreements affect the vibe.

{"query": "I messed up in front of everyone and I can’t stop replaying it.", "response": "I’ve been there — that feeling of wanting to rewind time, but your brain just loops the scene instead. That’s a tough space to be in. \n\nFirst, take a breath. We all have those moments — moments that feel huge to us but often go unnoticed or forgotten by everyone else faster than we think. \n\nTry this: Close your eyes for a second and ask yourself, “Will this matter a week from now? A month?” Usually, the answer helps shrink it down to size.\n\nAlso — be as kind to yourself as you would be to a friend in the same situation. You’re human, and humans slip up sometimes. It doesn’t define you.\n\nIf you feel like sharing, I’m here. Sometimes saying it out loud takes away its power."}
{"query": "My friend is being super clingy and I need space.", "response": "It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed — that's totally understandable. Friendships need a balance of closeness and space, and it's okay to set gentle boundaries when you need it.\n\nHere are a few ideas you could try, depending on your comfort level and your friendship style:\n\n**1. Kind but direct communication (when you're ready):**  \nLet them know you appreciate them and enjoy your friendship, but explain that you’re in a season where you need a little more alone time to recharge. You could say something like:  \n> \"Hey, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately and need a little space to recharge. It's nothing personal — I really value our friendship!\"\n\n**2. Slow down responses gradually:**  \nIf bringing it up feels too awkward, you could start by responding to texts or calls a bit more slowly, or schedule hangouts less frequently. Be consistent so it doesn’t seem like you’re ignoring them out of the blue.\n\n**3. Offer alternatives that feel comfortable:**  \nInstead of completely pulling back, suggest low-energy ways to connect — like sending memes, short check-ins, or planning a casual activity in the future rather than spontaneous hangouts.\n\n**4. Reflect on their possible perspective:**  \nSometimes clinginess comes from their own insecurities or loneliness. If you feel up to it, you could gently ask if everything’s okay on their end — but only if you have the emotional bandwidth.\n\n**How do you usually handle conversations about boundaries with friends?**"}
{"query": "Someone said something racist/sexist in class and the teacher ignored it.", "response": "That’s really tough. Hearing a racist or sexist remark in class is hurtful and can make the learning environment feel unsafe, and it’s especially troubling when the person in authority—the teacher—doesn’t address it. Whether they didn’t hear it, weren’t sure how to respond, or chose to avoid confrontation, their silence can feel like permission.\n\nHere are a few things to consider, depending on your comfort level and the situation:\n\n1. **Take care of yourself first** – It’s okay to feel upset, angry, or frustrated. Give yourself a moment to process how you feel.  \n2. **Talk to the teacher privately** – If you feel comfortable, you could approach the teacher after class and let them know how the comment affected you. Sometimes teachers freeze in the moment and may genuinely not know how to handle it. Calmly explaining your perspective might help them understand the impact and take steps in the future.  \n3. **Reach out to a trusted adult** – If the teacher is unresponsive or if you don’t feel comfortable talking to them directly, consider speaking with another teacher, a school counselor, or an administrator.  \n4. **Connect with supportive peers** – You’re likely not alone in feeling uncomfortable or hurt. Sometimes, talking with friends or classmates about it can help, and you might decide to address it together.  \n5. **Report it anonymously** – Many schools have ways to report incidents like this without revealing your identity. Check if your school has a reporting system in place for discrimination or harassment.\n\nRemember:  \n- You have the right to feel safe and respected in your classroom.  \n- Silence from authority figures doesn’t make the comment okay.  \n- It’s not your responsibility alone to fix this, but taking steps can help ensure it doesn’t happen again.  \n\nIf you’d like, I can help you draft a message to a teacher or counselor, or talk through how you’re feeling.

You’ll be able to explain things more clearly if you're not too anxious.\n\n2. **Think about why the grade happened.**  \n   Were you struggling with the material? Did something else affect your focus? Having a reason (not an excuse) can help them understand it’s not just carelessness.\n\n3. **Own it, but show you want to improve.**  \n   Parents often respond better when you show responsibility and a plan. Maybe say something like:  \n   “I didn’t do as well as I wanted on this, and I’m really disappointed. I’ve been thinking about how to do better next time, like [mention a specific idea, e.g., asking the teacher for help, studying differently, etc.].”\n\n4. **Pick a calm moment to talk.**  \n   Not right when they get home from work or during a stressful time.

Do they show genuine interest in your life, or does the focus often shift away from you?  \n3. **Consider talking to them** — If you feel comfortable, you could gently bring it up in a non-accusatory way.

If the change makes you feel more like yourself or brings you joy, that’s what matters most in the long run.\n\nYou deserve to present yourself in a way that feels true to who you are — even if it takes a little bravery to get there. What kind of change are you thinking about making?"}
{"query": "I’m getting headaches from stress and I don’t know what to do.", "response": "Hey, that’s totally understandable — stress headaches are the worst. When your mind is running nonstop, your body sometimes decides to chime in with a headache as a not-so-subtle “hey, take a breather.”\n\nHere are a few things you could try — pick what feels doable for you right now:\n\n**In the moment:**\n- **Pause and breathe:** Take a slow, deep breath in for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Even a few rounds can dial down tension.\n- **Hydrate:** Sometimes a glass of water and a small snack (low blood sugar can add to headaches) helps.\n- **Cold or warm compress:** A cold pack on your forehead or a warm towel on your neck/shoulders can ease muscle tension.\n\n**Short-term relief:**\n- **Gentle movement:** Stretch your neck, shoulders, or take a short walk—moving a little can interrupt the stress loop.\n- **Dim lights & quiet:** If you’re somewhere bright or loud, step into a calmer space if possible.\n- **Over-the-counter pain relief:** If it’s really bothering you, something like ibuprofen or acetaminophen *as directed* can help—but try not to rely on it too often.\n\n**Longer-term strategies:**\n- **Identify triggers:** Jot down when headaches happen. Is it after certain tasks, conversations, or times of day?\n- **Build in mini-breaks:** Even 5 minutes every hour to stretch, look away from screens, or step outside.\n- **Try mindfulness or relaxation:** Apps like Calm or Insight Timer have short guided sessions for stress.\n- **Talk it out:** Sometimes just venting to a friend or writing in a journal can relieve pressure.\n\nAnd hey — if headaches become frequent, severe, or come with other symptoms (vision changes, dizziness, etc.), it’s worth checking in with a doctor to rule out other causes.\n\nStress is a signal. Be kind to yourself — you don’t have to “power through” all the time. \n\nHow are you feeling right now? Want to talk about what’s stressing you out?"}
{"query": "Someone keeps ‘joking’ about fighting me and it’s not funny anymore.", "response": "That’s not okay. Even if it’s framed as a joke, talking about fighting or threatening someone can be unsettling and intimidating — especially if it’s happening repeatedly after you’ve expressed that it bothers you.  \n\nIt might be time to clearly and firmly tell this person something like:  \n\n> “I know you might think it’s funny, but when you talk about fighting me, it doesn’t feel like a joke to me. It makes me uncomfortable, and I’d like you to stop.”  \n\nIf they dismiss your feelings or keep doing it, that’s a red flag. You have the right to distance yourself or, if the situation feels unsafe, speak to someone you trust (or authority figures, if appropriate).  \n\nYou’re not overreacting — humor should never come at the expense of someone feeling safe."}
{"query": "I feel left out even when I’m literally with my friends.", "response": "That’s a really tough feeling, and it’s more common than you might think. Even when you’re physically with people, emotional disconnection can make you feel lonely or overlooked. Do you notice what situations or conversations tend to trigger that feeling for you? Sometimes it helps to identify patterns—like if it happens during certain topics, group sizes, or settings."}
{"query": "I got asked out and I don’t like them that way.", "response": "That can feel tricky — wanting to be kind but also clear. Want some ideas on how to handle it?"}
{"query": "I like two people at the same time and I feel guilty.", "response": "It sounds like you’re in a tough spot emotionally, and I want you to know it’s actually pretty common to develop feelings for more than one person. Emotions don’t always follow “rules,” and you’re not doing anything wrong just by feeling this way.\n\nWhat’s important is how you choose to handle these feelings. Here are a few gentle suggestions that might help you navigate this:\n\n1. **Take your time to understand your feelings.**  \n   — Try writing down what you appreciate about each person. Is it about how they make you feel? Is it attraction, comfort, shared interests? This can sometimes help you sort through your emotions.\n\n2. **Consider honesty and boundaries.**  \n   — If you’re already in a relationship or dating one of them, it’s important to be honest with yourself and them about what’s happening. If you’re not exclusive, it may still be helpful to reflect on what you truly want.\n\n3. **It’s okay not to have all the answers right now.**  \n   — Feelings can be complicated, and it’s okay if you don’t have everything figured out. Give yourself permission to feel without rushing into a decision.\n\n4. **Think about long-term compatibility.**  \n   — Sometimes we’re drawn to certain people for different reasons, but it can be useful to think about who aligns best with your values, life goals, and the kind of relationship you want in the long run.\n\nIt’s natural to feel guilty, but remember — having feelings isn’t something to punish yourself over. How you act on those feelings is what matters most.\n\nWould it help to talk through your situation a bit more? I’m here to listen."}
{"query": "My parent read my diary/notes and I feel so violated.", "response": "That is an incredibly tough and hurtful feeling. It’s completely understandable that you feel violated — a diary or personal notes are meant to be a private space for your thoughts, and having that trust broken can make you feel exposed and disrespected.\n\nIt might help to:\n\n1. **Take a moment to breathe** — it’s okay to be upset, angry, or sad. Let yourself feel that without judging it.\n2. **Consider talking to them calmly** when you’re ready — sometimes parents don’t realize how serious it feels to you. You could say something like, \"When you read my private notes, it made me feel like my thoughts aren’t safe, and I really value having my own space.\"\n3. **Find a new way to keep your thoughts private** — whether it’s a locked journal, a digital document with a password, or something only you can access. That might help you feel secure again.\n\nRemember, your feelings are valid, and you have a right to privacy. 💙"}
{"query": "I feel like I’m doing my best and it’s still not enough.", "response": "Hey, I hear you. That feeling can be really heavy. It's tough when you're giving everything you've got and still feel like it's not measuring up—whether that's at work, in relationships, with personal goals, or just keeping up with life in general.\n\nSometimes the pressure comes from outside expectations, sometimes from our own inner critic, or maybe both. It’s okay to acknowledge how draining that is.\n\nWhat do you think is making you feel this way right now? Is there a specific area of life where it's hitting hardest, or is it a more general feeling?"}
