I totally get why you're putting it off.\n\nHonestly though, I think waiting usually makes it feel way scarier than it actually ends up being. Most parents appreciate honesty, even when the news isn't great. If I were you, I'd probably just rip the band-aid off and tell them straight up - maybe something like \"Hey, I got my grade back on [assignment/test] and it didn't go well. I'm disappointed too and I want to figure out how to do better next time.\"\n\nI'd also think about what went wrong so you can show them you're taking it seriously. Like, did you not study enough, was the material confusing, or were you dealing with other stuff? Parents usually respond better when they see you're being reflective about it rather than just making excuses.\n\nWhat subject was it, and do you think your parents are going to be more disappointed or angry about it?"}
